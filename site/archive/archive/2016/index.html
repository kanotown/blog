Today is 大晦日 (omisoka), which means new year's eve.<br/><br/>"晦日 (misoka)" was originally written as "三十日 (misoka)", and it meant "the 30th day of a month".<br/><br/>Then, it has come to mean "the last day of a month".<br/><br/>Furthermore, "the last day of a year" has come to be referred to as "大晦日 (omisoka)" with the letter "大 (o)", which means "large".<br/><br/>Also, "晦日" can be read as "tsugomori".<br/><br/>"Tsugomori" is an abbreviation for "月隠り (tsuki-gomori)", which means "the day that the moon hides".<br/><br/>I talked about the etymology of "大晦日 (omisoka)" on new year's eve of this year.<br/><br/>I will talk about traditional Japanese events that are held in "大晦日 (omisoka)" on new year's eve of next year.<br/><br/>I hope that I will continue to Lang-8 until one year later.

<div class="date" hidden>Dec 30, 2016 18:16</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the idiom "mushi no shirase", the literal meaning of which is "word of insects".<br/><br/>"Mushi no shirase" means to feel that something will happen.<br/><br/>In many cases, this idiom is used to bad events, such as a death in family/friends, a traffic accident or a disaster.<br/><br/>There are two major theories as the etymology.<br/><br/>One is derived from the fact that in Edo period, people thought that insects lived in human bodies and they affected emotions and consciousness.<br/><br/>The other one is derived from the fact that in Taoism of China, it is thought that three insects are live in human bodies since humans were born, and these insects inform God of humans' guilts while humans are sleeping.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday I wrote about "mochitsuki" (rice cake pounding).<br/><br/>Today I will talk about the proverb "e ni kaita mochi", which includes the word "mochi".<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "e ni kaita mochi" is "a rice cake drawn in a picture", and it means that something is totally useless or there is no possibility to realize something, even if it looks/sounds good.<br/><br/>This proverb comes from the fact that even if you can draw mochi (rice cake) in a picture very well, you can't eat it, and it is not useful.<br/><br/>The etymology is the Chinese word "gabei", ("ga" means "picture" and "bei" means "mochi") which can be found in Sangokushi.

Today I went to a professor's house and did mochitsuki.<br/><br/>The literal meaning of mochitsuki is "rice cake pounding", and it is a traditional Japanese event that is held around the new year.<br/><br/>In the mochituki, we pound boiled rice using a mortar and a pestle, and make mochi (sticky rice cake). <br/><br/>Unfortunately, since I had less stamina, physical strength, and experience, I couldn't pound mochi well.<br/><br/>On the other hand, professors and associate professors were getting used to the action, and they pounded mochi skillfully.<br/><br/>I could not contribute much to making mochi, but I ate very delicious mochi after the mochitsuki.

Today I will talk about the Japanese word "hesokuri".<br/><br/>"Hesokuri" means saving money that is piled up economically and secretly.<br/><br/>Here, "heso" means "a thread winding that is wound with hemp threads", and "maki" means "to wind threads", that is, "to make a thread winding".<br/><br/>In the past, the job of "heso wo kuru" (to make a hemp thread winding) is a housewife's important sideline business that supports poor living.<br/><br/>A little money that can be gained by this job was called "hesokuri gane" (hesokuri money), and it became "hesokuri" for short.<br/><br/>By the way, "hesokuri" is referred to as "a stash of money", "secret money" or "mad money" in English.

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "mono no kazu."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "mono no kazu" is "the number of things," and it means something valuable, something special, or something that has to be problematic.<br/><br/>This term is often used with a negative word -- it's something like "mono no kazu deha nai" (it's not mono no kazu).<br/><br/>Usage example: The cold in Japan is not mono no kazu compared to the one in Russia.<br/><br/>Although the literal meaning of this term is "the number of things," it expresses "thing".<br/><br/>I feel a little strange about that.

Since today is Christmas, I will talk about trivia related to Christmas.<br/><br/>The first Christmas (Mass of Nativity Festival) in Japan was held at Yamaguchi Prefecture in 1552.<br/><br/>However, because Edo shogunate government issued Anti-Christian Edicts and prohibited Christianity, Christmas was not held for more than 200 years.<br/><br/>It is said that Christmas was gradually accepted around 1900, when Christmas business competition began. <br/><br/>Also, along with Taisho Emperor system was collapsed on December 25, 1926, this day became a holiday as Taisho Emperor Festival only around that years.<br/><br/>This fact seems to be also deeply related that Christmas became an annual event in Japan.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, according to a questionnaire survey, around half of Japanese people will spend alone this Christmas.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese idiom "goma wo suru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to grind sesame seeds," and it often means to butter up someone.<br/><br/>(Of course, it can mean to just grind sesame seeds in a mortar.)<br/><br/>If you grind roasted sesame seeds, they will be smeared throughout in the mortar.<br/><br/>From the fact that such sticky sesame seeds looked like that someone tried to gain another's favor, this idiom was made.<br/><br/>This idiom is often said to be "goma suri" for short.<br/><br/>By the way, there are many English phrases that means "goma wo suru," but many of them seems to be vulgar expressions.

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "omou tsubo".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "thought pot", and it means that something goes what you wanted or what you expected.<br/><br/>Usage example: The war situation became enemy's omou tsubo (thought pot).<br/><br/>Here, "tsubo" means a pot, especially which is used to roll a dice in gambling.<br/><br/>It is said that an experienced dealer who had a role of rolling a dice could decide the number of the dice as he thought.<br/><br/>From this fact, to become what you wanted/expected has come to be referred to as "omou tsubo" (thought pot).

Today I will talk about the Japanese idiom "sune wo kajiru."<br/><br/>"Sune" means "shin", "kajiru" means "to bite", and this idiom describes that children cannot be economically independent, and lives depending on their parents.<br/><br/>(Here, "sune" (shin) implies "oya no sune" (parents' shins), so this idiom is also often referred to as "oya no sune wo kajiru.")<br/><br/>Since shins are important part that support people, they are sometimes used as a synonym for "labor".<br/><br/>That is to say, this idiom expresses that children bite (depend on) their parents' labor forces.<br/><br/>By the way, I was biting my parents' shins until I graduated from my doctoral course.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the etymology of the Japanese word "tokoya", which means "barber shop".<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "toko" is "floor", and "ya" is "shop".<br/><br/>In the Edo period in Japan, people who make men's hairstyle or cut men's hair were called "kami-yui" ("kami" means "hair" and "yui" means "to fix").<br/><br/>Also, since hairstyles were made / hairs were cut on a simple floor, such a store was called "kami-yui doko" ("doko" means "floor").<br/><br/>Then "kami-yui" in "kami-yui doko" was omitted, and "ya" which means "shop" or "occupation" was attached, it became "tokoya".<br/><br/>By the way, most customers of tokoya are men, and women usually go "biyoin" (hair salon).

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "funuke".<br/><br/>"Funuke" means people who has no backbone, no energy, or no guts.<br/><br/>Usage example: He fell out of love and became funuke since last week.<br/><br/>The literal meaning "fu" of "funuke" is "bowels", and it has also come to mean "courage" or "heart".<br/><br/>(I think this is similar that "guts" can express "courage" in English.)<br/><br/>Also, "nuke" of "funuke" means "to drop out".<br/><br/>Therefore, "funuke" came to mean people who drop out their courage or hearts, and express the above meanings.<br/><br/>By the way, according to my dictionary, an English word which means "funuke" is "coward" or "fool".

When I read sentences written by people who learn Japanese on Lang-8, I found that "narau" is often confused with "manabu".<br/><br/>You can say just "I learn Japanese" to mean both "nihongo wo narau" and "nihongo wo manabu", but there is a determinate difference between these Japanese sentences.<br/><br/>In most cases, "narau" means to be taught something by someone.<br/><br/>On the other hand, "manabu" means to remember or study something by oneself.<br/><br/>Therefore, it's unnatural to use "narau" when teaching yourself something, and you should use "manabu" in such a case.<br/><br/>By the way, it is said that "manabu" is derived from "manebu", which means "to imitate".

Today I will talk about the Japanese phrase "ocha wo nigosu."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to roil tea", and it describes to manage to avoid an issue by saying something irresponsible.<br/><br/>It is said that this phrase comes from the fact that people who don't know sado (Japanese art of tea ceremony) roil tea so that it looks like appropriate Matcha.<br/><br/>In the past, Matcha was a special thing that only high rank people can drink.<br/><br/>Therefore most ordinary people didn't know how to make Matcha.<br/><br/>By the way, now sado is thought of as one of Japanese hobbies and has spread, but I don't know how to make Matcha.

In English, the word "water" is used regardless of the temperature.<br/><br/>However, the literal translation "atsui mizu" ("atsui" means "hot" and "mizu" means "water" in Japan) is a little unnatural.<br/><br/>In Japanese language, nouns that represent water change depending on the temperature.<br/><br/>"Mizu" often translates into "water", but if you say just "mizu", it will represent "cold water".<br/><br/>If you want to represent "hot water" or "boiled water", you have to say "oyu/yu" or "netto".<br/><br/>If you want to represent "chilled water", you have to say "reisui" or "hyosui".<br/><br/>By the way, "lukewarm water" is referred to as "nuruma yu", and if the water was once boiled, it's referred to as "sayu".

Today I will talk about the Japanese idiom "ita ni tsuku."<br/><br/>"Ita ni tsuku" means that someone's attitude or behavior becomes to be suitable for his/her occupation or status.<br/><br/>Where "ita" means "a boarded stage", and "tsuku" means "to fit perfectly".<br/>(Normally, "ita" means just "a board".)<br/><br/>Since acting of experienced actors is match up precisely with the stage, such actors have been said "ita ni tsuiteiru" (you're fitting the boarded stage).<br/><br/>This phrase "ita ni tsuku" became to have the above meaning, moreover it became to express that clothes fit someone well.<br/><br/>By the way, as a result of searching for the English translation of it, an expression "to become natural to one" was found.

Today I will talk about the Japanese idiom "mimi wo soroeru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to arrange ears", and it describes to prepare money without deficiencies.<br/><br/>In many cases, this idiom is used when repaying debts.<br/><br/>For example: I repaid my debts without deficiencies (Mimi wo soroete shakkin wo hensai shita).<br/><br/>In Japan, quadrilateral/oval things are sometimes thought of as a face, and the edges of them are referred as "mimi" (ears).<br/><br/>In fact, edges of oval gold coins that were used as money were called "mimi".<br/><br/>Since payments were prepared by arranging edges of gold coins, "mimi wo soroeru" (to arrange ears) came to be used in such a situation.

Today I will talk about the Japanese idiom "taka wo kukuru."<br/><br/>"Taka wo kukuru" means to predict an amount of something easily, and to downplay it.<br/><br/>"Taka" means an amount of harvesting or income, and "kukuru" means to bundle something or to calculate something in advance.<br/><br/>Therefore, the literal meaning of this idiom is just to predict an amount of something.<br/><br/>The reason why it contains the meaning of downplaying is considered to be derived from the fact that we estimated military forces based on "kokudaka" (which means a kind of unit to express productivities of lands) during Edo period in Japan.

Yesterday I talked about a customary Japanese event "makura-nage".<br/><br/>Today I will talk about the official rules of it.<br/><br/>Players wear yukata (Japanese bathrobe) as uniform, and the game is held on tatami (straw mat) where futon and pillows are placed.<br/><br/>Each team consists of eight persons -- five players (including one general, one libero) who throw pillows and three supporters who collect pillows that went outside of the tatami area.<br/><br/>Players who were hit by pillows leave from the field, and the winning condition is to eject the opponent's general.<br/><br/>A libero has a role of defending the friendly general from pillows using futon (Japanese bedding).<br/><br/>Also, one supporter can call "a teacher is approaching～" once in each game.<br/><br/>If this phrase is called, the opponent's general have to go into futon quickly and pretend to be asleep.<br/><br/>All players except generals have to get down on their knees for 10 seconds assuming the teacher found them.

In many Japanese schools, students and teachers go a school trip for a few days annually.<br/><br/>In the midnight in the trip, there is a customary annual event called "makura-nage."<br/><br/>"Makura" means "pillow", "nage" means "to throw", and during the "makura-nage", students throw pillows to each other.<br/><br/>There is no rules in many cases -- they just throw pillows heart and soul.<br/><br/>Here, futon (Japanese bedding) is often used as shields to pillows.<br/><br/>By the way, I heard that pillows are regarded as a weapon in Germany.<br/><br/>Tomorrow I will talk about the official rule of the makura-nage in Japan.

Today I will talk about the slang "zokkon".<br/><br/>"Zokkon" means to be crazy about someone or to love someone passionately.<br/><br/>For example: "Ano onna no ko ni zokkon nanda" (I'm crazy about that woman).<br/><br/>It is thought that this word comes from "底根" (sokone), which can be read as "sokokon".<br/><br/>"Sokone" literally means "the bottom of roots", and it can express "the bottom of your heart".<br/><br/>In the past, "zokkon horekomu" ("horekomu" means "to love with someone") was often used to mean to be crazy about someone, but recently, you can express the meaning by just using "zokkon".

Today I will talk about the idiom "hozo wo kamu."<br/><br/>"Hozo" means "a belly button" ("hozo" is commonly said as "heso" in Japan), "kamu" means "to bite", and "hozo wo kamu" describes to bitterly regret or to cry over split milk.<br/><br/>This idiom comes from the fact that even if you try to bite your belly button, your mouth would never reach it.<br/><br/>It has been confirmed that this idiom had been used in ancient Chinese stories during the Chunqiu period.<br/><br/>By the way, although both "heso" and "hozo" have the same meaning "a belly button" and the same kanji character "臍", "heso wo kamu" is regarded as a wrong usage.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "on no ji".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "the character 'on' (御)", and it describes that something is much appreciated or  very satisfying.<br/><br/>The character "御" (on) is one of the highest grade honorific words which is attached to the head of a noun.<br/><br/>Therefore, when you want to attach "御" to something, it is quite impressive and terrific.<br/><br/>However, this term is often used to wrongly mean something like that it's not satisfying but enough.<br/><br/>According to the public opinion survey in Japan, 51.4% use the term wrongly, and 38.5% use it correctly.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the idiom "mimi wo katamukeru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to lean an ear," and it describes to listen carefully/keenly so as not to miss talks.<br/><br/>This idiom comes from the fact that when you try to listen to something carefully, your ear leans.<br/><br/>The common kanji for "kiku", which means "to hear", is "聞く", but if you use another kanji "聴く" for "kiku", you can imply the meaning of "mimi wo katamukeru" (to listen carefully).<br/><br/>By the way, it will be said "to lend an ear" in English.<br/><br/>There is also another idiom "mimi wo kasu," which is the literal translation of "to lend an ear," but it has a little different nuances.<br/><br/>"Mimi wo katamukeru" (to lean an ear) implies that you listen to speaker's talk respectfully, while "mimi wo kasu" (to lend an ear) implies that you listen to your close person's talk or you provide consultation for him/her.

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese idiom "te haccho kuchi haccho."<br/><br/>This idiom describes a person who does something well and has a smart mouth.<br/><br/>"Te" means "hand", "kuchi" means "mouth", and "haccho" means "eight things", so this idiom literally describes a person who can use eight tools by his/her hands or mouth.<br/><br/>Of course, you can use just "te haccho" for a person who does something well, and just "kuchi haccho" for a person who has a smart mouth, respectively.<br/><br/>This idiom originally used as a good meaning to praise someone, but recently, it is often used sarcastically for an insincere person who just looks a good worker or a good talker.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese proverb "hebi ni niramareta kaeru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of this proverb is "a frog aimed by a snake," and it expresses that someone stands frozen in front of something scary.<br/><br/>Since snakes swallow frogs, snakes are regarded as a natural enemy of frogs, and this proverb was made.<br/><br/>By the way, it is famous in Japan that snakes, frogs and slugs are natural enemies to each other; this relationship is called "sansukumi" (three-way standoff), and it is similar to scissors-paper-rock.<br/><br/>Frogs can eat slugs, but snakes' venom doesn't work to slugs, and slugs' mucus melt snakes' body.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese phrase "shippo wo tsukamu."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to grab a tail," and it expresses "to get evidence of secrets or crime."<br/><br/>In Japan, secrets and crime could be referred to "shippo" (tail).<br/><br/>Here, the tail represents a tail of a raccoon dog or fox.<br/><br/>Even if a raccoon dog or fox changed their figure into something, you could reveal the true identity by grabbing their tails, thus this idiom was made.<br/><br/>Also, to come out secrets or crime is called "shippo wo dasu" (to come out a tail).<br/><br/>You can find these phrases frequently  in Japanese criminal dramas.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the idiom "ibara no michi".<br/><br/>"Ibara" means "thorn", "michi" means "path", therefore "ibara no michi" sometimes literally means "a path where thorns are growing."<br/><br/>However, in many cases, this idiom is used to express a difficult situation or a life full of hardships.<br/><br/>This comes from the fact that it's very difficult to follow a path covered with thorns.<br/><br/>The English word "thorn" and "thorny" even mean something like "hardship", so this idiom "ibara no michi" might have come from English.<br/><br/>By the way, I heard that "thorn" symbolizes "curse" in the Bible.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "tachi ojo".<br/><br/>"Tachi" means "to stand", "ojo" means "to die", so "tachi ojo" refers to "to die while standing."<br/><br/>Yesterday I talked about "Benkei".<br/><br/>It is believed that Benkei was shot by a lot of arrows from surroundings in the battle of Koromogawa, and he died while standing supported by his long halberd called naginata.<br/><br/>From this story, "tachi ojo" can also refer to a state that someone is incapable of moving or something is dead-end.<br/><br/>By the way, I found that "Benkei's tachi ojo" was translated into "the last stand of Benkei" in English on the Internet.

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "benke no nakidokoro."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "Benke's weak point," and it expresses "shin" (that is a part of your body), "weak point" or "vital spot" .<br/><br/>In the past in Japan, there was a tough heroic figure named "Musashibo Benke".<br/><br/>Although he was heavily built, he cried when he would be kicked his shin, so this term was made.<br/><br/>By the way, it is said "Achilles' heel" in English.<br/><br/>Achilles is a legendary and immortal hero in Greek mythology, but he had the only weak point on his heel, so this term was made.<br/><br/>The term "Achilles tendon" comes from the same story.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese word "sarumane."<br/><br/>"Sarumane" means to imitate acts or surfaces of other people without thinking.<br/><br/>The etymology is very simple: "saru" means "monkey", "mane" means "to imitate", and "sarumane" comes from the fact that monkeys often imitate people's acts without reason.<br/><br/>Basically, to imitate something merely without your own thinking will not work well.<br/><br/>Therefore, "sarumane" is a derogatory word against such people.<br/><br/>According to the dictionary web site, this word can be translated into "awkward imitation", "poor imitation", or "cheap imitation" in English.<br/><br/>By the way, I also found the word "copycat".<br/><br/>I think that "copycat" is appropriate as a translation of "sarumane".

Today I will talk about the four-Chinese character idiom "tanto chokunyu."<br/><br/>"Tanto chokunyu" means to get straight to the main point with no preamble.<br/><br/>For example: "Tanto chokunyu ni iuto, kimi wa kubi da." (I'll get straight to the point. You're fired.)<br/><br/>This idiom comes from the Chinese history book called "The Records of the Transmission of the Lamp."<br/><br/>"Tanto" means "a single sword," "chokunyu" means "to enter straight into somewhere," and "tanto chokunyu" originally meant that someone rushes into an enemy position by oneself with a single sword.<br/><br/>Deriving from it, this idiom has come to mean to the above meaning.

<div class="date" hidden>Nov 23, 2016 09:10</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Recently, I've talked about Japanese phrases related to cats.<br/><br/>Today I would like to talk about the two Japanese proverbs "neko ni katsuobushi" and "neko ni matatabi."<br/><br/>Cats like both "katsuobushi" and "matatabi", but the meanings of these proverbs are different from each other.<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "neko ni katsuobushi" is "dried bonito to cats," and it expresses to fall into a dangerous situation. <br/><br/>This comes from the fact that if you put dried bonito in front of a cat, the cat will eat it very quickly.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the literal meaning of "neko ni matatabi" is "silver vine to cats," and it expresses that something is very effective.<br/><br/>This comes from the fact that if you give a cat silver vine, the cat become happy  drunkenly.

Yesterday I took a big mistake.<br/><br/>Although I continued posting English sentences on Lang-8 every day more than 700 days, it ended yesterday.<br/><br/>I wrote an article as always, and I believed that I pushed the "Publish" button.<br/><br/>However, the action didn't work.<br/><br/>I don't understand whether the reason was network failure or my mistake.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm very sad.<br/><br/>A blank day was created on the calendar of Lang-8.<br/><br/>In fact, however, there is the fact that I have continued learning English every day.<br/><br/>I'm feeling regret for my blunder, but I will keep doing my study from now on also.

Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese word "nekobaba."<br/><br/>"Nekobaba" means that someone steals something from others sneakily. <br/><br/>"Neko" means "cat", and "baba" ("糞" in kanji) is an infant word in Edo period that means "feces".<br/><br/>It is said that this word comes from cats' behavior that they hide their feces by putting sands.<br/><br/>Also, "baba" can be written as "婆" in kanji, and it means "an old woman."<br/><br/>There is another theory about "nekobaba", and it insists that the word comes from a story that an old woman.who likes cats didn't return her debt.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "neko wo kaburu."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to wear a cat," and it expresses that someone hides his/her actual character, and behaves like an innocent person.<br/><br/>Perhaps many Japanese people think that this phrase comes from a fact that cats looks innocent, but they're actually fierce. <br/><br/>However, there are another theory about the etymology of this phrase.<br/><br/>"Mushiro" (Japanese matting made of rice straw) can be referred to as "neko" or "nekoda".<br/><br/>The other theory insists that this phrase comes from that to wear such a matting is identical with to profess ignorance.

Today, I will talk about the phrase "yubi wo kuwaeru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of this phrase is "to put one's finger in one's mouth," and it expresses a state that someone envies other people/things but can't get them.<br/><br/>Actually I searched for the etymology, but it was not exist on the Internet.<br/><br/>Note that the following sentences are just my thought.<br/><br/>It is said that one of the reasons why babies and young children put their fingers in their mouths is to disguise their hunger.<br/><br/>It looks like they envy dishes but can't get them, so eat their fingers instead.<br/><br/>From such a scene, I think that this phrase has come to express the above meaning.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese term "ippiki ookami."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "a (lone) wolf," and it indicates a person who doesn't rely on organizations or fellows, and acts by his/her own.<br/><br/>Wolves usually make groups, but some of them get away from the herd and drift alone.<br/><br/>Such a wolf is called "ippiki ookami" (a lone wolf), and this term has come to be used for a person.<br/><br/>Several years ago, a Japanese TV show examined what a wild lone wolf is saying by using Bow-Lingual, which is a kind of communication tool with dogs made in Japan.<br/><br/>As a result, the wild lone wolf said something like "what should I do?"<br/><br/>Both lone wolves in wild and human society might not want to become lone wolves.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese proverb "kabe ni mimi ari shoji ni me ari."<br/><br/>This proverb expresses that secret things or gossips are prone to leak.<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "kabe ni mimi ari" is "there are ears on walls," and it indicates that someone might listen to anytime while placing his/her ear against a wall.<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "shoji ni me ari" is "there are eyes on shoji (Japanese paper sliding doors)," and it indicates that someone might peep inside through the door.<br/><br/>That is to say, this proverb says that you have no idea when and who listen/see your talks and acts, so you have to be careful whatever you do.<br/><br/>By the way, I heard that there is almost the same proverb in English "Walls have ears."

Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "hara ga tatsu."<br/><br/>Usually "hara" means "stomach" and "tatsu" means "to stand," so learners of Japanese might think that it means "one's stomach stands."<br/><br/>However, this phrase actually means "to be angry."<br/><br/>In Japan, it has been thought that stomachs contain one's feelings since a long time ago.<br/><br/>Also, "tatsu" can mean that something appears intensely.<br/><br/>Therefore, "hara ga tatsu" means "one's feeling come out intensely," and it has come to express the feeling of angry.<br/><br/>By the way, if you want to use this phrase as an adjective, you can say "hara data shi-i（はらだたしい）."

Today is World Diabetes Day.<br/><br/>Diabetes is a kind of disease that makes blood sugar level rise chronically, and it occurs when insulin which lowers blood sugar level doesn't work.<br/><br/>In reaction to the fact that diabetic patients have increased throughout the world, WHO specified November 14 as World Diabetes Day in 1991.<br/><br/>November 14 is the birthday of Frederick Grant Banting, who discovered insulin.<br/><br/>In this day, various facilities are lighted up blue all over the world, and several events and symposiums related to diabetes are held.<br/><br/>The blue light up comes from the World Diabetes Day's symbol "blue circle."<br/><br/>However, according to a study at Northwestern University published in PLOS ONE in this year, the risk of diabetes might increase by being exposed blue light.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese phrase "ton chin kan."<br/><br/>"Ton chin kan" expresses that things are not consistent, something is irrelevance, or someone is stupid.<br/><br/>For example, you can say something like  "don't say ton-chin-kan na koto (irrelevant comments)," or "he is ton-chin-kan (stupid)." <br/><br/>Originally, this word was an onomatopoeic word that represents hammer sounds by blacksmiths.<br/><br/>In a blacksmith shop in the Edo period, a master and a disciple strike with a hammer alternately to make a Japanese sword.<br/><br/>Since different sounds resonate at irregular intervals, the onomatopoeia "ton chin kan" has come to express the above meanings.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "momiji gari."<br/><br/>"Momiji" means "autumn leaves," "gari" means "to hunt," and this phrase means to visit mountains for viewing autumn leaves.<br/><br/>"Gari (karu)" was originally used to mean to hunt beasts or birds in fields or mountains.<br/><br/>This meaning expanded, and it came to mean to go to fields or mountains for taking something.<br/><br/>Foe example, you can say something like "kinoko gari" (mushroom hunting) or "ichigo gari" (strawberry hunting).<br/>(I heard that "mushroom hunting" is popular in Europe countries.)<br/><br/>Furthermore, currently "gari" comes to be used for "autumn leaves" to mean "to view autumn leaves."

Today is Pocky &amp; Pretz Day in Japan.<br/><br/>Pretz is a stick-shaped snack that has been sold since 1963 by the Japanese confectionery maker "Ezaki Glico." <br/><br/>Also, pocky is pretz coated with chocolate, and has been sold since 1966.<br/><br/>Since both snacks are long and thin, November 11 (11/11) was established as the anniversary in November 11, Heisei 11 (1999 in the western calendar).<br/><br/>Today, you can find campaigns or events related to these snacks in various stores.<br/><br/>By the way, many other companies and organizations also defined November 11 as a anniversary day.<br/><br/>There are about 30 different specific names, and my favorite one is "Binary Day."

Today, I will talk about the Japanese idiom "abura wo uru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "abura wo uru" is "to sell oil," and it expresses that someone neglects on his/her work temporarily or has an idle talk.<br/><br/>In the Edo period in Japan, oil sellers chatted with customers for a long time when they sold oil.<br/><br/>Oil has high viscosity, and it took a long time to transfer the oil to customer's container, so oil sellers spent the time talking.<br/><br/>From this fact, to neglect work or to have an idle talk came to be referred to as "abura wo uru."

Today, I will talk about the derivations of the similar kanji "皿" (which means "plate") and "血" (which means "blood").<br/><br/>The kanji "皿" comes from a hieroglyphic character that symbolizes "plate".<br/><br/>In the kanji "血", the added shape "ノ" on "皿" means a cup of blood, and "血" expresses a plate that contains blood.<br/><br/>In the past in China, it's said that people devoted human's (or animal's) blood poured into a plate to God during festivals.<br/><br/>This is the reason why "plate" and "blood" have the similar kanji.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "zuboshi".<br/><br/>Originally, "zuboshi" is the term of Japanese archery, and it shows a black circle in a hoshimato, which is one of archery targets in Japan.<br/><br/>Since archers aim at the center of "zuboshi", it has come to mean "vital point," and come to express "to guess correctly." <br/><br/>For example, you can use "zuboshi" in the following situation:<br/><br/>Man A: "Hey, you like that girl of your classmate, don't you?"<br/><br/>Man B: "No, no no, you you're wro wrong."<br/><br/>Man A: "You look so upset.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese idiom "miso wo tsukeru."<br/><br/>"Miso" is fermented soybean paste, and "miso wo tsukeru" literally means "put miso (on surface of something)."<br/><br/>In addition to the literal meaning, "miso wo tsukeru" can express "to fail in something" or "to lose face."<br/><br/>In the past in Japan, people put miso on burn areas as a private treatment method.<br/><br/>Since burn wounds imply some sort of failure, the phrase "miso wo tsukeru" (put miso on burn areas) came to imply failure too.<br/><br/>Note that this phrase can express the literal meaning like "kyuri ni miso wo tsukeru" (put miso on the cucumber).

In Japan, there is a superstition that is related to spiders like following:<br/><br/>"Let morning spiders get away even if they are your foes, kill night spiders even if they have children."<br/><br/>I was also told something like this superstition when I was child, but I'm not sure the reason.<br/><br/>I found a theory that morning spiders represent visitors and night spiders represent thieves on the Internet, but there is no scientific basis.<br/><br/>In general, house spiders are beneficial insects that eat injurious insects like flies or cockroaches, so I basically don't kill spiders even when I find them at night.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese proverb "ame futte ji katamaru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of this proverb is "the ground solidifies after a rainfall," and it expresses that a relationship would get better after a conflict or a trouble happened. <br/><br/>If it rains, the ground will become soft, and if the ground dries, it will be more firm than the initial state.<br/><br/>This phenomenon came to be used for human relationships.<br/><br/>There are also similar expressions in English: "After a storm comes a calm" and "After rain comes fair weather."<br/><br/>However, I'm not sure whether or not these English phrases are used mainly for human relationships like "ame futte ji katamaru."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese proverb "nuka ni kugi."<br/><br/>"Nuka" means "rice-bran paste," "kugi" means "nails", and "nuka ni kugi" is used to express that there is no effect.<br/><br/>For example: Giving a caution to him is nuka ni kugi (meaningless).<br/><br/>This proverb comes from the fact that even if you nail soft rice-bran paste, you can't obtain any effect.<br/><br/>Also, there is another proverb "noren ni udeoshi," which has the same meaning  as "nuka ni kugi."<br/><br/>"Noren" means a curtain-like cloth hanging down over an entrance of Japanese stores, and "udeoshi" means an arm wrestling.<br/><br/>Of course, to arm-wrestle with noren is meaningless like nuka ni kugi.

Today (November 3) is Culture Day, which is a national holiday in Japan.<br/><br/>Culture day was established in 1948, and the purpose is to love the peace and liberty and to promote culture.<br/><br/>In Japan, many events will be held today:the award ceremony of Order of Culture by the Emperor at the Imperial Palace, the All Japan Kendo Championships at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, and the exhibition of a full-dress defense ship by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force<br/><br/>Some museums and art galleries will open free or held special events.<br/><br/>Also, today is known as a day that the probability of becoming clear skies is high, so I hung my bedding (futon) to dry at my balcony in this morning.<br/><br/>By the way, unfortunately today is not a holiday in my university.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese slang "teppan".<br/><br/>"Teppan" usually means "a iron plate" literally, but it has also the adjective meaning of "no doubt" or "reliable".<br/><br/>For example, if you say "a teppan joke," it will mean "a joke that surely makes everyone laugh."<br/><br/>The etymology is very simple: a teppan (an iron plate) has an image as solid.<br/><br/>This slang has been used since the mid Showa era (around 50 years ago) among gamblers.<br/><br/>For example, if you say "a teppan race" on a horse racing, it will mean "a race that is almost certain to win (though the payment rate is low)."<br/><br/>In recent year, this slang has rapidly spread to our lives through comedians.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "tanuki neiri."<br/><br/>"Tanuki" means raccoon dogs, "neiri" means "to sleep," and  "tanuki neiri" expresses that someone pretends to fall asleep.<br/><br/>Raccoon dogs are very timid, so if you surprise them, they'll faint for a while.<br/><br/>Also, it has been thought that raccoon dogs can deceive people in Japan. <br/><br/>Therefore, people thought that the faint of raccoon dogs is fake to deceive us, and we came to refer to "sham sleep" as "tanuki neiri" (raccoon dog sleep).<br/><br/>By the way, I heard that the English phrase "fox sleep" means "sham sleep."<br/><br/>Japanese people have thought that foxes can also deceive us like raccoon dogs, so the English phrase is very interesting.

Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese word "abekobe".<br/><br/>"Abekobe" means "opposite" or "reverse", and this has been used since the Edo period.<br/><br/>Example: The world in the mirror is abekobe(opposite) to the actual world.<br/><br/>"A" in "abekobe" means a faraway place ("there" in English, "achira" in Japan), "ko" means a close place ("here" in English, "kochira" in Japan), and "be" means its surroundings.<br/><br/>Originally, "abekobe" was "achirabe kochirabe", but it was abbreviated.<br/><br/>Also, there is another words "achira kochira" and "achikochi" that omit "be" in "achirabe kochirabe."<br/><br/>However, the main meaning is different from "abekobe"; "achira kochira" and "achikochi" means "various places."

Today, I will talk about the proverb "mago nimo isho."<br/><br/>"Mago" means a person who carries people and luggage while leading a horse, and "isho" means dress clothes.<br/>(Currently in Japan, there is almost no people who work as mago.)<br/><br/>This proverb expresses that everyone will look good by wearing dress clothes, even if he/she is a low ranked person like mago. <br/><br/>Note that if you say this proverb to others, it can be rude.<br/><br/>Also, since the reading "mago" can mean "grandchild", some people think that "mago nimo isho" means "any cloth suits a grandchild," but this thought is wrong.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "appare."<br/><br/>"Appare" expresses that something is very respectable or admirable.<br/><br/>Also, it can be used alone like "attaboy" when you praise something excellent.<br/><br/>For example, you can use it something like "teki nagara appare da" (although you are a competitor, you deserve to be praised), or "appare na sigoto buri" (you do an admirable work).<br/><br/>The word "appare" comes from the "aware", which meant strong feelings of sorrow or joy.<br/><br/>Currently, "aware" mainly expresses "sorrow" or "pity", while "appare" expresses "acclaim".<br/><br/>Please be careful not to say "aware" when you praise someone.

In the yesterday post, I introduced a phrase "mizu no awa," which means that efforts end in vain.<br/><br/>Today, I'd like to talk about the phrase "bo ni furu," which has the same meaning of "mizu no awa."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "bo ni furu" is "to swing a pole," and it implies that a merchant walks around to sell goods while shouldering a carrying pole with baskets hung at both ends.<br/><br/>Also, such an act or a merchant was referred to as "boteburi" or "furiuri".<br/><br/>In Japan during the Edo period, boteburi have to sell fish and vegetables until the baskets would empty.<br/><br/>Furthermore, even if all goods were sold, the profits were small.<br/><br/>From this fact, "bo ni furu" comes to mean "efforts end in vain."

<div class="date" hidden>Oct 26, 2016 21:50</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese idiom "mizu no awa."<br/><br/>"Mizu" means "water", "awa" means "bubble," and "mizu no awa" can express "bubbles that float on a surface of water" literally.<br/><br/>However, in most cases, it is used when you express that your efforts or works end in vain.<br/><br/>For example, when you say "my efforts become mizu no awa (bubbles on water)," it means that your efforts disappear like fleeting bubbles that float on water.<br/><br/>Also, there is another expression "suiho ni kisu," the literal meaning of which is "to return back to bubbles on water."<br/><br/>"Suiho ni kisu" has exactly the same meaning of "mizu no awa," but I think it sounds smarter (this is my personal opinion).

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are two types of month; that has the 31st day, or doesn't have the day.<br/><br/>Today, I will introduce the Japanese phrase "nishi muku samurai," which is used for remembering months that don't have the 31st day (that is, February, April, June, September and November).<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "nishi muku samurai" is "a samurai who are facing the west," and it can be divided into "ni", "shi", "mu", "ku", and "samurai".<br/><br/>Here, "ni" means "two" (February), "shi" means "four" (April), "mu" means "six" (June), and "ku" means "nine" (September) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Furthermore, "samurai" implies "eleven" (November), but the reason is a little complicated.<br/><br/>Eleven is written as "十一" in kanji, and when you arrange it vertically, it becomes "士".<br/><br/>"士" (shi) means "武士" (bushi), and "武士" is equivalent to "侍" (samurai), hence "侍" can express "eleven".

Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "mizu kusai."<br/><br/>"Mizu kusai" literally means "it smells water," and it expresses that someone is polite, formal, and secretive.<br/><br/>Originally, the phrase "mizu kusai" is used for alcohol or dishes that contains a lot of water, as the meaning of "it has a little taste" or "it's unsavory."<br/><br/>This has come to be used for people, and it has come to mean "you have little affection."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, if you say "mizu irazu," the literal meaning of which is "there is no room to add water," you can express "close relationships" or "family gatherings."

Today, I will talk about the proverb "gyofu no ri."<br/><br/>"Gyofu" means "fisherman", "ri" means "benefits", and "gyofu no ri" is used as an example of that a third party grabs benefits without pain when two parties conflict with each other.<br/><br/>This proverb is derived from a Chonese story called "Sengoku strategies."<br/><br/>The story is something like the following:<br/><br/>A snipe tried to eat the inside of clam, but its beak was sandwiched.<br/><br/>The snipe said "you'll die in dry if you don't open the shell and return to the sea," but the clam said "you'll die in starvation if you don't pull out your beak."<br/><br/>Both of them stood firm.<br/><br/>Then a fisherman came here, and he caught both the snipe and calm.

Today, I will talk about the traditional Japanese food "dango".<br/><br/>Dango is a kind of dumpling made from flour of cereal or rice, which is added to water and steamed.<br/><br/>There are various kind of dango; seasoned with bean paste of sugar and soy sauce, soybean flour, or artemisia.<br/><br/>"Hanami dango" (dango for cherry-blossom viewing) is often eaten during cherry blossom viewing party, and is usually composed of three color dango that is on a skewer.<br/><br/>There are some theories of the reason of three color dango, but the most widely accepted one is that the red (pink) dango means cherry blossom, the white dango means spring haze, the green dango means verdure, that is, the hanami dango expresses spring.<br/><br/>By the way, there is a Japanese proverb "花より団子" (dango is better than blossoms), which means that people prefer to beneficial things than beautiful things.

Today, I will talk about the interesting Japanese occupation "Oshiya".<br/><br/>Oshiya means people who push passengers and luggage that are protruded from train doors during rush hours.<br/><br/>This occupation was first introduced at Shinjuku station in 1955.<br/><br/>Oshiya are arranged in front of each train doors; roles of them are to induce passengers to relatively unoccupied areas, and to notify the conductor of whether or not doors can be closed, in addition to pushing.<br/><br/>Also, if passengers try to get on a train by head and shoulders, oshiya will pull and get them back to the platform.<br/><br/>At such a case, oshiya (pusher) becomes hagashiya (puller).

"Mago no te" literally means a grandchild's hand, and is a rod-shaped tool that is used for scratching one's back.<br/><br/>Since itches on back have been a common stress for people throughout the world, similar tools have used all over the world.<br/><br/>Therefore, it's not known when and who invented it.<br/><br/>In Japan, mago no te is normally made of wood or bamboo; the tip is bent and it looks like a cupped hand.<br/><br/>Actually, I thought that since it looked like a grandchild's hand, it was called mago no te, but I was wrong.<br/><br/>The etymology comes from a mythical fairy of China, whose name is Mako.<br/><br/>Mako had a very long nails, and it was thought that it would feel good if she scratched itchy spots.<br/><br/>This "Mako no te" (Mako's hand) was introduced to Japan, and the name became "mago no te" (grandchild's hand).

<div class="date" hidden>Oct 17, 2016 00:05</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the readings of the Japanese word "一日".<br/><br/>"一" means "one", "日" means "day", but "一日" has two meanings: "one day (24 hours)" and "the first day of a month."<br/><br/>When you want to mean "one day," you have to read "一日" as "ichi-nichi".<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you want to mean "the first day of a month," you have to read "一日" as "tsuitachi".<br/><br/>The reason of the irregular readings is to make it easier to distinguish between these two meanings.<br/><br/>Also, the etymology of the reading "tsuitachi" comes from "月立ち(tukitachi)", which implies the beginning of a month.

Japanese language is commonly used in Japan.<br/><br/>However, the official languages of Japan is not defined explicitly under Japanese laws.<br/><br/>Of course, we learn Japanese language in school education, and official documents in Japan are written in Japanese, so it's practically a official language.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Angaur States of Republic of Palau defined Palauan, English, and Japanese language as its official languages. <br/><br/>The reason why that contains Japanese language is that Palau was a mandated territory of Japan.<br/><br/>Although only this region in the world defined Japanese language as the official language, there seems to be no people who can speak Japanese.

Today, my laboratory members and I held imoni kai, the literal meaning of which is "stewed potato party."<br/><br/>Imoni kai is a traditional Japanese party that people make a nabe (pot) dish using taro and eat it in a river bed, and this party is mainly held in the Tohoku region in Japan.<br/><br/>Since the harvest season of taro is around October, imoni kai is normally held in autumn.<br/><br/>There are various seasoning ways, and we made two types of them: "Tonjiru-style"(which is seasoned like miso soup) and "Sukiyaki-style" (which is seasoned with soy source and sugar).<br/><br/>It was a hard work because we had to make furnaces by assembling stones.<br/><br/>However, both styles were really delicious and I was satisfied.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "nuka yorokobi."<br/><br/>"Nuka" means pericarp and seed coat that are produced after polishing grains (bran), "yorokobi" means a joy, and "nuka yorokobi" expresses a short-lived joy.<br/><br/>Originally, "nuka" also expressed "small" or "fine" because of the look.<br/><br/>From this fact, it came to mean something like short-lived, and we came to refer to "a short-lived joy" as "nuka yorokobi."<br/><br/>For example, imagine a situation that you won the big lottery and went to a bank with joy, but one digit was actually different.<br/><br/>This is nuka yorokobi.<br/><br/>By the way, there is no relationship with today's topic, but this entry is the 666th post.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese proverb "Atama kakushite shiri kakusazu," the literal meaning of which is "One hides the head, but doesn't hide the ass."<br/><br/>This proverb expresses that although someone hides some parts (head) of his/her disadvantages or crimes, other parts (ass) aren't hidden.<br/><br/>Basically, it's used when you ridicule people who believe that all things will be invisible by hiding only the part.<br/><br/>Also, the etymology of the proverb comes from a behavior of pheasants.<br/><br/>When pheasants are chased by people or other animals, they will hide by diving their heads into the grass, but their tails can be seen clearly.

Japanese children say "yubikiri genman uso tsuitara hari senbon nomasu" while crossing their little fingers when they make a promise.<br/><br/>In the case of adults, the phrase becomes just "yubikiri" or "yubikiri genman."<br/><br/>At one time, Japanese prostitutes cut off their fingers and present them for particular customers to prove their loves.<br/><br/>(It's said that there were many imitation fingers.)<br/><br/>Cutting off fingers (which is called "yubikiri" in Japan)  became widespread and the meaning changed to "to keep a promise."<br/><br/>Also, "genman" means "ten thousands fists," and "hari senbon nomasu" means "to make someone drink a thousand needles."<br/><br/>Japanese children say this phrase as they are singing, but the actual meaning is horrible: "If you tell a lie, I will cut off your little finger, fist you 10,000 times, and make you drink 1,000 needles."

Today, I will talk about the Japanese proverb "toudai moto kurashi."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "under the toudai is dark," and it expresses "<br/>it's difficult to take account of the closest things."<br/><br/>"Toudai", which is also called "toushokudai", means a stand for placing a plate of oil, and is used for brightening the room by setting fire.<br/><br/>Although the toudai can brighten the surroundings of itself,  under the stand becomes shaded and very dark.<br/><br/>From this fact, "toudai moto kurashi" came to mean "it's difficult to take account of the closest things or things about yourself."<br/><br/>By the way, there is another proverb that has the similar meaning: "Chikakute mienu wa matsuge," the literal meaning of which is "What you can't see because of the closeness is your eyelash."

Today, I learned the Japanese idiom "hanage wo kazoeru," which means "to count nose hair."<br/><br/>Although this idiom is listed in general dictionaries, I didn't know it until today.<br/><br/>The literal meaning is just a strange act, but it refers to that a women control a man who likes her at will.<br/><br/>I heard that this idiom was established in the Edo period, but I don't know the correct etymology.<br/><br/>Anyway, I feel that a man whose nose hair is counted by a woman is pitiable.<br/><br/>By the way, you can also say "hanage wo yomu" (to read nose hair), instead of "hanage wo kazoeru."

Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "uri futatsu."<br/><br/>The literal translation is "two melons," and it means that brothers or parent and child are very similar to each other.<br/><br/>This word comes from the fact that when you cut a melon in two, these  cross sectional shapes are very similar.<br/><br/>However, the same is true for many other vegetables and fruits.<br/><br/>Although it's not fully reliable, it could come from the fact that a cross section of a melon was compared to a face of a beautiful woman in Japan.<br/><br/>By the way, there is a similar expression in English: "as like as two eggs."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I introduced a Japanese idiom "ashi wo arau" (to wash one's feet), which means "to quit crime or evil jobs."<br/><br/>Today, I will talk about the Japanese idiom "te wo someru" (to dye one's hand), which means "to start things or jobs."<br/><br/>The most widely accepted theory about the etymology is that "染める(someru)", which means "to dye", was originally "初める(someru)", which means "to start".<br/><br/>Also, there is another theory: once you dye your hand with dye ink, it will remain for a long time, as well as once you start something, it's hard-to-quit.<br/><br/>Since "te wo someru" is often used with words related to crime, many people think of it as "to start bad things," but it actually means just "to start something."<br/><br/>By the way, I heard that when you want to express "te wo arau" in English, you can say "to get one's feet wet."

Today, I will talk about the Japanese idiom "ashi wo arau."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to wash one's feet," and it expresses "to quit crime or evil jobs."<br/><br/>It's thought that this idiom comes from Buddhism.<br/><br/>In Buddhism, Buddhist priests walk around with their bare feet for ascetic training.<br/><br/>After they return back to temples, they wash their dirty feet for purifying spirits of evil thought in a secular world, then <br/><br/>From this fact, "ashi wo arau" (to wash one's feet) came to mean "to quit bad things."<br/><br/>There is another theory about the etymology, which comes from that Jesus Christ washed his disciple's feet, but it lacks credibility because the unspoken meaning is different.

There is the proverb "onna gokoro to aki no sora," the meaning of which is "women's Feelings and autumn sky."<br/><br/>This proverb expresses that women are as fickle as autumn weather.<br/><br/>Actually, there is also a similar proverb "otoko gokoro to aki no sora," the meaning of which is "men's feelings and autumn sky."<br/><br/>This proverb expresses that men are as fickle as autumn weather, and tend to cheat on their partners.<br/><br/>It's thought that the proverb came from the fact that cheating by married woman was punished heavily, while cheating by men wasn't in the Edo period.<br/><br/>Today, such sex discrimination vanished, and I think that the women version of the proverb is used more frequently than the men version.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese insult "atama ga piman," whose literal meaning is "your head is a green pepper."<br/><br/>This phrase expresses something like that "you have no brains."<br/><br/>The etymology is very simple: green peppers have large hollows in their insides.<br/><br/>In a similar way, there is a Japanese insult "hanashi ga piman," (your talk is a green pepper), which means "your talk is empty."<br/><br/>Note that these phrases were popular in the 1970s, and we rarely use them today.<br/><br/>By the way, if you say just "piman" (a green pepper) to someone, it can be an insult that means "your have no brains" or "you're empty."

Today, I will talk about the Japanese proverb "ishibashi wo tataite wataru."<br/><br/>The literal meanings is "to cross a stone bridge after beating it," and it expresses "to do something cautiously and carefully."<br/><br/>This comes from that although stone bridges look firm, very careful people beat them for confirming safe conditions.<br/><br/>This proverb is often used to mean "someone is very careful," while it sometimes used to mean "someone is too cowardice" with irony.<br/><br/>Also, we sometimes say "ishibashi wo tataite kowasu" (to break a stone bridge by beating it too many times) for people who fail due to their carefulness, and say "ishibashi wo tataite wataranai" (not to cross a stone bridge after beating it) for people who don't act.<br/><br/>By the way, there is an English proverb "Hear twice before you speak once," which has the similar meaning.

Today, I will talk about the similar Japanese words "hieru" and "sameru".<br/><br/>Both of them use the same kanji "冷", and both can be expressed as "to get cool," but there is a clear difference about the meaning.<br/><br/>When you want to choose either word, consider it based on ordinary temperature.<br/><br/>"Hieru" means that bodies or things are cooled down below ordinary temperature.<br/><br/>For example: "Karada ga eacon de hieru" (my body gets chilled by the air conditioner) / "Reizoko de kudamono wo hiyasu" (I cool fruits in the refrigerator).<br/><br/>"Sameru" means that hot bodies or things are cooled down around ordinary temperature.<br/><br/>For example: "Atatakai gohan ga sameru" (hot rice gets cool) / "hotetta karada wo uchiwa de samasu" (I cool down my heated body by using a paper fan).

Today, I will talk about the Japanese idiom "saji o nageru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to throw a spoon," and this spoon expresses a spoon that is used in pharmaceutical preparations.<br/><br/>In the past, (Chinese medicine) doctors prepared medicines for curing patients.<br/><br/>However, when any approach to treatment wasn't found, they gave up and threw the spoons for preparing medicines.<br/><br/>From this story, "saji o nageru" came to mean "to conclude there is no chances and give up."<br/><br/>In the Edo period, there was a senryu （satirical haiku/poem） "inaka isha saji o nagete ha uma de nige," which means that a rural doctor threw a spoon and ran away riding a horse.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese idiom "hana ga takai," whose literal meaning is "long nose".<br/><br/>Of course, this idiom has meaning that someone's nose is physically long, but has also meaning of "proud" or "boastful".<br/><br/>For example, it's used as "musuko ga tenis no taikai de yusyo shite hana ga takai" (my nose is long because my son won the tennis tournament).<br/><br/>It is said that this idiom comes from a long-nosed goblin called Tengu.<br/><br/>The Tengu is a mythical creature in Japan, and is also called "symbol of pride."<br/><br/>If you say "Tengu ni naru" (to be Tengu), it will express "to be proud."<br/><br/>"Hana ga takai" and "Tengu ni naru" have the same etymology, but note that the former doesn't have bad nuances, while the latter expresses bad impressions.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I talked about the word "daikon ashi" (daikon radish legs).<br/><br/>Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese word "daikon yakusya", which also uses a vegetable daikon radish.<br/><br/>The literal meaning is a daikon radish actor, and expresses an actor who gives a bad performance.<br/><br/>There are various theories about the etymology, but I will show you the two of them today.<br/><br/>One is that almost all dishes of daikon radishes never cause food poisoning ("to have food poisoning" is called "atarru" in Japan), so they came to mean "the actor won't be a big hit" ("to be a hit" is called "ataru" in Japan).<br/><br/>The othe one is that daikon radishes are white ("shiro" in Japanese), so amateurs ("shiroto" in Japanese) came to be called daikon.<br/><br/>I heard that a daikon radish actor is called "a ham actor" in English.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "daikon-ashi".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "daikon/Japanese radish legs", and it is used for comparing women legs to daikon radishes in many cases.<br/><br/>(The kanji "足" (feet) is commonly used for the "ashi" in the "daikon-ashi", but it means "脚" (legs) in this word.)<br/><br/>Currently, this word is used as a bad meaning, and implies that the woman's legs are thick like a daikon radish.<br/><br/>However, daikon radishes were actually very thin in the past.<br/><br/>Therefore, comparing women's legs or arms to daikon radishes meant "they're thin and white," and was a compliment expression.<br/><br/>If you make a slip of the tongue and say "daikon-ashi" to a woman, you should say "of course in the past meaning" quickly.

Today, I will talk about the fish called "seahorses", which have interesting shapes.<br/><br/>Seahorses are called "tatsu no otoshigo" (babies of dragons) in Japan, because their shapes look like dragons.<br/>(In English, it was named "seahorses", because they looked like horses)<br/><br/>Interestingly, males of seahorses have brood pouches on their abdomen like females of kangaroos, and they grow their eggs laid by females up to juveniles.<br/><br/>Therefore, it looks as if males breed their children.<br/><br/>By the way, when a female lay her eggs into a brood pouch of a male, the shape of two seahorses looks heart-shaped, and it's very romantic.

Today, I'd like to talk about the famous Japanese proverb "inu mo arukeba bo ni ataru."<br/><br/>The literal translation is "dogs that walk around will strike on a stick," but it expresses two different meanings.<br/><br/>One is that if you do something, you may be involved in unexpected misfortune.<br/><br/>This meaning is paired with the proverb "kaho ha nete mate," which means that everything comes to those who wait.<br/><br/>The other is that if you keep doing something, you will have unexpected fortune.<br/><br/>It is said that the latter meaning was established later.<br/><br/>I prefer the latter to the former.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "mucha-kucha".<br/><br/>The "mucha" in "mucha-kucha" means that "something is unreasonable," or "something is excessive."<br/><br/>The "kucha" in "mecha-kucha" just emphasizes "mecha", and is put for arranging the rhythm of the word.<br/><br/>Therefore, both "mucha" and "mucha-kucha" have the almost similar meanings, but only "mucha-kucha" has the meaning of "something is spoiled."<br/><br/>This word is also said something like "mecha-kucha" or "mecha-mecha" instead of "mucha-kucha".<br/><br/>By the way, if you want to mean "something is excessive," you can also say "muccha", "meccha" or "mechanko".<br/><br/>(Note that "muccha" and "meccha" are the young people's words, and "mechanko is the Nagoya-city dialect.")

Today, I will talk about the Japanese proverb "yakeishi ni mizu."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "water to a burnt stone," and it expresses that any effect cannot be expected if your effort or help is a little bit.<br/><br/>The derivation is very simple: it's because if you put a little water on a burnt stone, the water will evaporate quickly.<br/><br/>There is another proverb that has the similar meaning, "nikai kara megusuri," whose literal meaning is "eye-drops from a second-floor."<br/><br/>This proverb also means "it's frustrating that things don't work out smoothly," in addition to "any effect cannot be expected."

Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese word "karada", which has two different kanji.<br/><br/>The most common kanji of "karada" is "体", but it's also often written as "身体".<br/><br/>Basically, "体" expresses a physical body, while "身体" expresses a body including one's mind.<br/><br/>Therefore, while you can use "体" for any of humans, animals and insects, "身体" is used for only humans.<br/><br/>Also, in daily use kanji chart, the correct reading of "身体" is not "karada", but "shintai".<br/><br/>That is to say, if there is "身体" in a formal document, it should be read as "shintai".

Dogs are called "inu" in Japan.<br/><br/>However, in the Meiji era, dogs (especially western dogs) were called "kame," which means turtles.<br/><br/>Also, "kame" was popular as a name of dogs at that time.<br/><br/>This came from misunderstanding of an English phrase.<br/><br/>It is said that Japanese people thought that Western people called dogs "kame ya" when they said "come here."<br/><br/>(In Japan, when people call someone or an animal, "ya" is sometimes put after the name.)<br/><br/>This misunderstanding was spread, and this is why Japanese people called dogs "kame".<br/><br/>Note that by no means the word "kame" means as dogs today.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese word "horafuki".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "a person who blows Hora", and it expresses "a person who exaggerates things" or "a liar".<br/><br/>"Hora" in "horafuki" comes from "horagai" (conch), and you can use it as a wind instrument by boring a hole.<br/><br/>Horagai as a wind instrument is used for avoiding beasts, or giving a cue of march.<br/><br/>This is because horagai can emit a very loud sound than its looks.<br/><br/>From this fact, "hora" came to mean "an unexpected bonanza", and "an exaggerated lie".<br/><br/>By the way, "an exaggerated fiction" is referred to as "horabanashi"(a hora story).

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese slang "he no kappa."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "water imp of farts," and it expresses "trivial things" or "easy things."<br/><br/>For example: "Sonna shiken wa he no kappa da" (That exam is trivial for me).<br/><br/>The most widely-accepted etymology of this slang is that it comes from "koppa no hi."<br/><br/>Since "koppa" (wood chips) burn out quickly by "hi" (fire), "koppa no hi" expresses "easy things" or "silly things."<br/><br/>It's thought that "koppa no hi" became "kappa no he," and inverting words became popular in the late Edo period, then it changed to "he no kappa."<br/><br/>Actually, "he no kappa" is grammatically strange.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Japanese people often say "honzitsu wa seiten nari" when testing microphones or wireless applications.<br/><br/>In the radio station operation guideline, this phrase is defined as the test words when emitting radio signals.<br/><br/>Actually, this is the literal translation of "It's fine today," which is often used for microphone tests in English-speaking countries.<br/><br/>Since "It's fine today" contains plosive and fricative sounds that are difficult to pick up by microphones, and has a wide frequency band, it's thought that the phrase is optimal for testing microphones.<br/><br/>On the other hand, since the translated phrase "honjitsu wa seiten nari" doesn't contain such elements that should be checked in microphone tests, the Japanese version seems to be unreasonable.<br/><br/>I heard that Japanese public address engineers use "maiku chekku wan too" (microphone check one two) when they check microphones.

It was decided that I (and my teacher) would receive an award from an academic society, and next week I will perform a keynote speech in English in commemoration of the win.<br/><br/>Since I never experienced such a speech before, I'm nervous now.<br/><br/>I would really appreciate if you could check the beginning part of my speech.<br/><br/>"Today, I'm feeling honored that we could receive this award. We'd like to strive for further developments of our study from now on also. Well, what we targeted at in this study was about a performance improvement of xxx. Since today is a rare chance, I would like to take this opportunity to introduce the overview of xxx, and the stream of our study."

Some people have a habit of smelling themselves.<br/><br/>Actually, the reasons of this behavior are divided into two major categories.<br/><br/>The first reason is to check own state.<br/><br/>Some of them smell themselves in order to check whether or not their bodies are healthy or their smells cause trouble to surrounding people.<br/><br/>The second reason is to get a sense of security.<br/><br/>This psychology is similar to a marking of animals.<br/><br/>By smelling their own bodies, they can be aware of their territories, and can feel relieved instinctively.<br/><br/>Therefore, smelling yourself is natural as human beings.<br/><br/>However, since it will cause trouble if you follow your instincts too much, you have to be careful.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese "yabu kara bou," whose literal meaning is "a stick from shrubs."<br/><br/>This is the abbreviation for "yabu kara bou o tsukidasu" (to poke a stick out from shrubs), and means that something happens or doing something suddenly without any warning.<br/><br/>The etymology is very simple: it's because if a stick is poke out from shrubs, you will be surprised.<br/><br/>Some people say "yabu kara hebi," whose literal meaning is "a snake from shrubs," but this usage is wrong.<br/><br/>It is thought that this abuse comes from the word "yabu hebi."<br/><br/>"Yabu hebi" is the abbreviation for "yabu o tsutsuite hebi o dasu," which means that "to lead bad consewuences by doing unnecessary things."

I don't like green peppers.<br/><br/>Most Japanese children don't like green peppers too.<br/><br/>In addition, any mammal, such as cows or horses, doesn't seem to like green peppers.<br/><br/>Actually, green peppers contain a poison called "alkaloids", which produce a bitter taste.<br/><br/>(It's virtually harmless because the amount of the poison is less and we can degrade all of them.)<br/><br/>Therefore, hating green peppers is instinctive and very natural for mammals.<br/><br/>Palates of many human beings degenerate with maturity, and they become to like green peppers. <br/><br/>It's said that the reason why your palate degenerates is because the taste becomes unnecessary as your brain develops.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese idiom "shiri ga aoi."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "your hip is blue," but it actually means that someone is premature or young.<br/><br/>This comes from that infant hips are bluish.<br/><br/>The blue hip is called "moukohan" (Mongolian blue spot), and is often observed in Asian.<br/><br/>In particular, it is said that more than 90% of Japanese infants have the moukohan.<br/><br/>It's thought that the generation mechanism of the moukohan is related to pigment called "melanocytes".<br/><br/>Also, there is another idiom "kuchibashi ga kiiroi" (your beak is yellow), which have the same meaning of "shiri ga aoi."<br/><br/>This comes from that a baby bird have a yellow beak.<br/><br/>I think that this idiom is similar to "green horn" in English.

 Since I found an interesting animal on the Internet today, I will share it.<br/><br/>It is the snake named "Storeria dekayi", which is also called "Dekai hebi" ("hebi" means "snakes") in Japan.<br/><br/>This snake is widely distributed in North America, and the population is stable: there is completely no worry about the extinction.<br/><br/>The name, "Storeria" comes from an American physician and naturalist "David Humphreys Storer", and "dekayi" comes from an American zoologist "James Ellsworth De Kay."<br/><br/>Here, what's interesting about the name is that "dekai" is a casual expression that means "big" in Japan.<br/><br/>I think that if Japanese people hear the word "Dekai hebi", most of them will image "a big snake", but they will be confused later because the snake is actually very small.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese word "ishi", which has several meanings and kanji.<br/><br/>"石" and "医師" mean "stone" and "(medical) doctor" respectively, so it's easy to use them properly.<br/><br/>However, there are three other different kanji for "ishi", and all of them are related to "thinking". <br/><br/>「意思」･･･  This kanji shows an inclination or thought, and is most commonly used among the three.<br/>For example: "帰りたいという意思を示す。" (I show my inclination to want to go home.)<br/><br/>「意志」･･･ This kanji shows a stronger thought or intention than "意思".<br/>For example: "強い意志を持って毎日勉強する。" (I study every day with a strong intention.)<br/><br/>「遺志」･･･ This kanji shows an intention of the deceased (a testamentary intention).<br/>For example: "祖母の遺志を継ぐ。" (I receive my grandmother's dying wish.)<br/><br/>By the way, the "し" in "石" is stressed, while in any other kanji, the "い" is stressed.

Today, I will talk about rhinoceros horn.<br/><br/>A rhinoceros is known to have a very hard skin, and a horn.<br/><br/>Actually, this horn is made of a protein called keratin, and there is no bone in the horn.<br/><br/>This is similar to hair (beard) or nails of humans, and if anything, it's closer to hair.<br/><br/>Therefore, even if the horn breaks, it will grow again naturally.<br/><br/>Since the rhinoceros horns are useful as herbal medicine, and the price can be higher than gold or platinum, rhinoceros poaching often takes place in massive.<br/><br/>By the way, bull's horns seem to be closer to nails.

I've written several posts related to left and right.<br/><br/>Today, I will talk about the reason why people keep the left in Japan.<br/><br/>Actually, the left-hand traffic had already established in the early Edo period.<br/><br/>The most widely-accepted theory comes from a rule to avoid fights between samurais.<br/><br/>A right handed wore a sheath on his left-side waist.<br/><br/>Of course there were more right-handed people than left-handed, so their sheaths (and they) would clash if they walked the right-hand .<br/><br/>Also, after the Edo period, it is said that Japan established the left-hand traffic as a traffic law officially to deepen friendly relations with the UK.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "Oaiso".<br/><br/>"Oaiso" comes from the word "aiso", which means "an affable attitude".<br/><br/>Originally, this word was used by restaurant staff as the meaning of "sorry I'm not affable" when they gave customers bills.<br/><br/>However, today it's often used when customers want to pay bills.<br/><br/>Actually, if customers say "oaiso" to restaurant staff, it can imply something like "since I'm disgusted at this restaurant, the check please."<br/><br/>Although meanings of words have been changed, I think that it's more acceptable to use "okaikei (okanjo) onegai shimasu" (could you bring me the check, please?) instead of "oaiso".

Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "kami", which has several meanings and kanji.<br/><br/>The most commonly used kanji for "kami" are "神" (God), "紙" (paper) and "髪" (hair).<br/><br/>Actually, only "神" has the different accent among the three kanji.<br/><br/>The primary accent of "神" is "か", while that of "紙" and "髪" is "み".<br/><br/>Therefore, it's easy to distinguish "神" in a conversation.<br/><br/>It's a little difficult to distinguish "紙" from "髪", but "髪" is often expressed as "髪の毛" (hair) for clarity.<br/><br/>By the way, although it's a little formal expression, "加味 (kami)" (seasoning/consideration) is also often used.<br/><br/>"加味" has the same primary accent as "神", but it's easy to distinguish between the two, because "加味" is normally used with "～する (suru)" (do something), just like "加味する."

Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese adjective "hana mo hajirau."<br/><br/>This is used to describe that a young woman is greenly and beautiful.<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "even flowers get shy," that is to say, it implies that the woman is so beautiful it makes even beautiful flowers feel inferior and get shy.<br/><br/>For example, this adjective is used as: "hana mo hajirau otome," or "hana mo hajirau otoshigoro."<br/><br/>"Otome" means a maiden, and "otoshigoro" means puberty, but I think that both of above example sentences can be translated into "a girl in the first flush of youth" in English.<br/><br/>As of this adjective, the Japanese language often uses flowers when describing the beauty of women.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "hige."<br/><br/>Hige means human's (especially man's) hair that grows above his upper lip (mustache), jaw (beard), or cheek (sideburn).<br/><br/>"髭" is often used as the kanji of "hige," but strictly speaking, "髭" means "mustache," "鬚" means "beard," and "髯" means "sideburn." <br/><br/>There are also three different words in English as well as the kanji.<br/><br/>The word "hige," which can show three different hair, seems to be unique to Japan.<br/><br/>By the way, it was considered that mustache bushi (Japanese samurai) in medieval Japan should grow their mustache, and bushi who have less mustache wore a false mustache.

Today, I come back to the Kanto region from the Kansai region.<br/><br/>In western Japan (Kansai), it's natural but I often heard that people speak in a Kansai dialect.<br/><br/>I will the Japanese word "ookini," which is often used by people live in the Kansai region.<br/><br/>"Ookini" sometimes could mean just "big," but it's used as the meaning of "thank you" there.<br/><br/>The etymology is "ookini arigatashi" ("ookini" means "very much," and "arigatashi" means "thank you"), and it became to say just "ookini" by omitting the latter part.<br/><br/>By combining the word "maido," which means "always," you can say "maido ookini" (thank you always).

The Japanese language has less syllable than that many other languages have, but has a plenty of onomatopoeia, which are often used in conversation.<br/><br/>Today, I will talk about some onomatopoeia that are related to touch.<br/><br/>"Sara-sara" ･･･ This shows that something is dry and beautiful, and there is no moisture.<br/>For example: "Sara-sara no kami" (silky hair)<br/><br/>"Fuwa-fuwa" ･･･ This shows that something is very soft.<br/>For example: "Fuwa-fuwa no makura" (a fluffy pillow)<br/><br/>"Zara-zara" ･･･ This shows that something is rough and not smooth.<br/>For example: "Zara-zara no kami" (a rough/harsh paper)<br/><br/>"Kasa-kasa" ･･･ This shows that something has no moisture, grease, and polish, and is dry.<br/>For example: "Kasa-kasa no hada" (a dry skin)<br/><br/>"Gowa-gowa" ･･･ This shows that something is hard, stiff, and isn't smooth.<br/>For example: "Gowa-gowa no fuku" (a stiff cloth)<br/><br/>"Gotsu-gotsu" ･･･ This shows that something is hard and bumpy.<br/>For example: "Gotsu-gotsu shita iwa" (a rugged rock)

Today, I came to Wakayama Prefecture to participate in an academic conference and perform my research presentation.<br/><br/>The presentation ended peacefully and I was fun meeting my mentor after all this time.<br/><br/>And today was my birthday.<br/><br/>There were no particular celebrations, and I had much work to do.<br/><br/>By the way, I decided to present a [my first name].ac domain to myself as my birthday present.<br/><br/>Since an ac domain looks like an academic website, I wanted to get it for a long time. <br/><br/>The actual meaning of the ac domain is Ascension Island of British, but I don't care a damn.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "utau," which has several different kanji.<br/><br/>"Utau" is normally written as "歌う" in kanji, and it means "sing" in English.<br/><br/>Basically, there is no problem if you can read/write this kanji.<br/><br/>There are two other kanji that mean "sing": "唄う" and "謡う."<br/><br/>"唄う" is often used for traditional Japanese songs or twitters of birds.<br/><br/>"謡う" is often used for Japanese nursery rhymes and folk songs.<br/><br/>Also, "詠う" is used for waka and tanka (traditional Japanese poem).<br/><br/>"謳う" is also read as "utau," but this is used when you praise something, or you want to emphasize your words.

<div class="date" hidden>Aug 30, 2016 02:25</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "shikii ga takai," which seems to be misunderstood by more than half of Japanese people.<br/><br/>"Shikii" means a threshold that is located in an entrance or gate, and you have to cross the shikii to enter the house.<br/><br/>If you feel the threshold is high (shikii ga takai), it implies that you don't want to enter the house.<br/><br/>That is to say, "shikii ga takai" means "it's difficult to enter the house BECAUSE I made trouble there in the past."<br/><br/>However, many Japanese people use this phrase to mean "it's difficult," "it's too high level," or "it's out of my league."<br/><br/>In such cases, it's correct to use "ハードルが高い" (the hudedle is high) or "分不相応" (it's out of my league).<br/><br/>If you find someone improperly using "shikii ga takai," please point it out.

Today, a really sad thing happened to me.<br/><br/>Hence I will talk about two Japanese expressions of sadness.<br/><br/>"Ten o aogu" ･･･ The literal meaning is "to look up to the sky."<br/><br/>This phrase expresses a person who trying to call for something on the God due to despair or grief.<br/><br/>"Unadareru" ･･･ The literal meaning is "to bow one's nape of the neck."<br/><br/>This phrase expresses a person dropping his/her head due to despair, sadness, or embarrassment.<br/><br/>Both of these expressions mean a kind of sadness, but the direction of the face is opposite to each other.

Today, I tried to solve exam problems of Japanese language on the Internet.<br/><br/>However, I made one mistake among five problems in the second grades.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe that foreign people trying to take N2 solve such difficult problems, but it was not "Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT)," but "The Japanese Language Examination" for native Japanese people.<br/><br/>To be honest, I'm relieved.<br/><br/>By the way, the problem that I made a mistake is related to "閑話休題 (kanwa kyudai)."<br/><br/>"閑話" means "digression," "休題" means "to stop the topic," and "閑話休題" means "to return to the main topic from the digression," which is translated as "but I digress" in English.<br/><br/>However, I thought that "閑話休題" means "to stray from the main topic and make a digression," which is something like "by the way" or "as an aside."<br/><br/>I heard that many Japanese people have misunderstood as I did, but I'd like to be more careful.

Today, I learned figures of raindrops.<br/><br/>I thought that the figure of raindrops while dropping is just a teardrop-shaped, which is something like '💧.'<br/><br/>However, actual raindrops don't have such a shape.<br/><br/>If the diameter of the raindrop is less than 3 mm, it will be an almost perfect sphere.<br/><br/>If the diameter is around 4-5 mm, the bottom of the raindrop will become flat by the air resistance, and it will be similar to a shape of a steamed meat bun.<br/><br/>If the diameter is more than 6 mm, the bottom of the raindrop will be hollowed and a cup-shaped, and eventually split into smaller raindrops.<br/><br/>Since diameters of typical raindrops are around 1 mm, most of shapes of raindrops that we usually see have a sphere shape.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese "空蝉 (utsusemi)."<br/><br/>"空" menas "empty," and "蝉" menas "cicada," and "空蝉" expresses "cicada shell."<br/><br/>Actually, this word originally comes from "現人 (utsushiomi)."<br/><br/>"現人" means "people who live in the world" or "this ephemeral world."<br/><br/>These meanings of "現人" are also included in "空蝉."<br/><br/>I think that it's interesting to describe "living" or "the world" as "空蝉."<br/><br/>By the way, since "semi" (cicada) is the summer insect, "空蝉" is a summer season word.

<div class="date" hidden>Aug 25, 2016 14:33</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are four different facial expressions in the Doraemon's song called "hug shichao" (let's hug). <br/><br/>Today, I will describe the meanings of them.<br/><br/>"Fukurettsura" ･･･ A displeased face puffing one's cheeks.<br/><br/>"Shikamettsura" ･･･ A frowning face with a knot between one's brows.<br/><br/>"Nakittsura" ･･･ A crying or tearful face.<br/><br/>"Bucchozura" ･･･ A sulky and sullen face.<br/><br/>Most the etymologies are simple: "tsura/zura" means "face," "fukureru" means "to swell/puff up," "shikameru" means "to furrow/knit one's brow," and "naku" means "to cry."<br/><br/>Also, Bucchozura comes from the face of a dignified Buddha called "Bucchoson," who has a sulky and sullen face.<br/><br/>By the way, I think that the antonym of all of these facial expressions is "egao," which means "smile."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese word "saba wo yomu," which means "to fudge the number/count to advantage."<br/><br/>This phrase is often used for one's age, height, or weight.<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "saba wo yomu" is "to count chub mackerel," and there are several theories as the etymology.<br/><br/>One is that we count chub mackerel quickly and roughly because they are caught in large numbers and are perishable.<br/><br/>In addition, some says it comes from "魚市場読み (izana-yomi)," which means to count fish with a fast mouth at a fish market, and others say it's because we treat two piece of sashimi (sliced row fish) of chub mackerel as one piece.<br/><br/>By the way, to fudge the number/count to disadvantage is called "gyaku saba" (reverse chub mackerel).

Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "tsutomeru," which has three different kanji.<br/><br/>① 努める<br/>"努める" means "to attempt something in an effort."<br/>(For example: I study hard / I attempt to realize my dream.)<br/><br/>② 勤める<br/>"勤める" means "to take on a job" or "to work at somewhere."<br/>(For example: I take service with the hospital / I work at a big company.)<br/><br/>③ 務める<br/>"務める" means "to fulfill a given role/mission."<br/>(For example: I will play a major role in the show / I accomplished my duty as a parent.)<br/><br/>It is said that both "勤める" and "務める" comes from "努める," which expresses "effort."<br/><br/>However, note that there are many cases that you can't replace these kanji because each kanji for "tsutomeru" has clear and different meaning.

The Japanese word "明日," which means "tomorrow," has three different readings, "ashita," "asu," and "myonichi." <br/><br/>In general, Japanese people often use either "ashita" or "asu."<br/><br/>"Ashita" originally meant "朝 (asa)," which means "morning," and used as an antonym of "夕べ (yube)," which means "evening."<br/><br/>Then the meaning came to change to "next morning," "next whole morning," and "next day."<br/><br/>On the other hand, "asu" means "tomorrow" from the beginning, and it seems to come from the abbreviation of "akasu," which means "dawn," or "asa," which means "morning."<br/><br/>Also, "asu" sometimes means "in the near future."<br/><br/>"Myonichi" is the just reading of "明日" in on-yomi (Chinese reading).<br/><br/>The most formal reading is "myonichi," the second place is "asu," and the most casual reading is "ashita."

Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese phrase "pin kara kiri made," which means "from the first to the last" / "whole gamut."<br/><br/>The "pin" comes from the Portuguese "pinta," which means "point."<br/><br/>This became to express "one" of a dice, then became to mean "the first" or "the best."<br/><br/>The "kiri" means "the last" or "the worst."<br/><br/>There are two theories about the etymology: one is that it comes from the Portuguese "cruz," which means "cross," and the other is that it comes from the Japanese "kagiri," which means "limit."<br/><br/>Recently, Japanese people often say just "pin kiri" for short.

The marathon competition of the Rio Olympics will be held tomorrow.<br/><br/>Today, I'd like to talk about trivia about marathons at the Olympics.<br/><br/>Spiridon Louis, who is the winner of the first Olympic marathon, drank wine instead of water at an inn along the way.<br/><br/>Spiridon Belokas, who was the third place of the first Olympic marathon, was disqualified, because he passed through some parts of the course riding a horse-drawn carriage.<br/><br/>The slowest record of Olympic marathons is 54 years 8 months 6 days and 5 hours, which was recorded by a Japanese Kanaguri Siso at the Stockholm Olympics in 1912.<br/><br/>He lost consciousness by a sunstroke in the marathon, and when he came to himself owing to helps of farmers, the competition was already ended.<br/><br/>After that, the Olympic ceremony was held in Stockholm in 1967, then the concerned personnel noticed that Kanaguri wasn't treated as "abstain," but as "missing."  <br/><br/>Therefore, he was invited to the ceremony, and finished the marathon officially.

Today, I will talk about the kanji for the Japanese word "katai."<br/><br/>"Katai" has three different kanji, "固い," "硬い" and "堅い."<br/><br/>I think that it will become easy to remember the differences by understanding these antonyms.<br/><br/>①固い<br/>"固い" is the most common writing among them.<br/>This kanji expresses that something is hard/rigid/firm, and the general antonym is "緩い" (loose/lax).<br/>For example: "結び目が固い" (The knot is hard/tight) / "頭が固い" (He has a hard head)<br/><br/>②硬い<br/>"硬い" expresses that something is strong/hard/stiff.<br/>The antonym is "柔らかい" (soft/flexible).<br/>For example: "硬い石" (a hard rock) / "表情が硬い" (your expression is stiff)<br/><br/>③堅い<br/>"堅い" expresses that something is solid, or has high certainty.<br/>The antonym is "もろい" (fragile/frail).<br/>For example: "私は意思が堅い" (I am stubborn) / "身持ちが堅い" (she is a virtuous woman) / "彼の勝利は堅い" (his victory is stable)<br/><br/>There are many cases where you can use both of them.<br/><br/>By the way, "難い" is also read as "katai," but the meaning is something like "it's difficult/hard to do."<br/><br/>Note that you can't use this kanji instead of other "katai."<br/><br/>(I think it can be exchanged for other "katai" in English, because all of "katai" can be translated into "hard.")

Today, I will talk about the Kanji of "tsukuru," which mainly means "make."<br/><br/>"Tsukuru" has three different kanji, "作る," "造る" and "創る." <br/><br/>①作る<br/>"作る" is the most common writing, and is used for relatively small, intangible, or abstract things.<br/>For example: "朝食を作る" (make a breakfast) / "時間を作る" (make time)<br/><br/>②造る<br/>"造る" is used for relatively big and tangible things.<br/>For example: "高いビルを造る" (make/build a tall building) / "ビールを造る" (make/produce beer)<br/><br/>Note that if you use "造る" for beer, sake, or miso, it means a large scale production. If you make them at home, you should use "作る."<br/><br/>③創る<br/>"創る" is used for new things or works of art.<br/>For example: "新しい制度を創る" (make/create a new system) / "独創的な彫刻作品を創る" (make/create a unique sculpture)<br/><br/>④つくる<br/>If it's intangible and it's difficult to choose one of above kanji, you can use "tsukuru" in Hiragana.<br/>For example: "良好な関係をつくる" (make/establish a friendly relationship) / "町づくり" (urban development)

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese proverb "hito no uwasa mo shichijugo-nichi" (gossip lasts 75 days).<br/><br/>As the term suggests, this proverb means that any gossip doesn't last more than 75 days, and it will be forgotten naturally in due course.<br/><br/>We often use this proverb as comforting words for a person who is depressed due to his/her bad gossip, e.g., "It's okay because gossip lasts less than only 75 days. "<br/><br/>The most acceptable reason why the number 75 is used is that there were five seasons once in Japan, and one season is around 75 days.<br/><br/>That is to say, our ancestors thought that any gossip would faded when seasons change.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
For many Japanese people, Bon holidays will end today.<br/><br/>Therefore, people who returned home will come back to areas where they currently work.<br/><br/>Of course, this will cause major traffic jams all over Japan.<br/><br/>By the way, it is said that most traffic jams on Japanese highways occur in sag sections, where the slope is changed from a decline to a uprise.<br/><br/>Actually, I also had to come back to Tokyo today.<br/><br/>However, since I really don't like traffic jams, I set off at around 2:30 A.M., and arrived at around 6:30 A.M.<br/><br/>I will go to bed from now until noon.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the difference between confusing Japanese words, "製作 (seisaku)" and "制作 (seisaku.)" <br/><br/>The readings of them are the same, and the meanings are similar, but the nuances are a little different.<br/><br/>"製作" is mainly used when you create something that is tangible, such as practical products.<br/><br/>For example: "大量のパソコンを製作する。" (I create/manufacture a lot of computers.)<br/><br/>"制作" is mainly used when you create an art work, such as a movie or a painting.<br/><br/>For example: "新しいパズルゲームを制作する。" (I create/produce a new puzzle game.)<br/><br/>Since there are many cases that can use both of them, you don't need to be sensitive too much.

Today, I'd like to write the remaining part of yesterday's post.<br/><br/>The second sightseeing spot where I visited was "Unagi Pie Factory."<br/><br/>Unagi means eels, and unagi pie is confectionery created by kneading eel powders into pie dough, which is popular as a souvenir in Shizuoka Prefecture.<br/>(It doesn't have a taste of eels at all.)<br/><br/>At the Unagi Pie Factory, you can see and learn the manufacturing process of unagi pie.<br/><br/>Although it was a short factory tour, I was fun.<br/><br/>I bought a lot of unagi pie as a souvenir.<br/><br/>After that, I returned home, then played with my nephew and niece.<br/><br/>Since I also played with them, I'm exhausted.

Today (technically 'yesterday' since it's midnight), I returned home in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture from Tokyo.<br/><br/>Along the way, I passed through three prefectures: Kanagawa, Yamanashi, and Shizuoka.<br/><br/>In Shizuoka Prefecture, I stopped at two sightseeing spots for a brief time.<br/><br/>The first place was "Komakado Kaza-ana."<br/><br/>(If you search for this cave on Google Images, you can find more beautiful pictures than those I uploaded.)<br/><br/>Kaza-ana means a kind of caves, and this is the oldest one in lava caves that were generated by a large explosion of Mt. Fuji.<br/><br/>Since the temperature in the cave is 13 Celsius degrees through the year, I felt cool.<br/><br/>This post will be too long, so I will write the residual part tomorrow.

The US, Japan, and many other countries think of a ground floor as a first floor.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the UK, European countries, and Australia think of a ground floor as a 0th floor.<br/><br/>Therefore, a first floor for the UK corresponds to a second floor for us.<br/><br/>I have never thought that the counting from first floor is wrong, but for basement floors, we count B1 (-1), B2 (-2), ...<br/><br/>Considering the number increases by one each floor, it might make sense that the ground floor is a 0th floor.<br/><br/>Also, counting from zero is approachable for many programmers.

Today, August 11th is Mountain Day.<br/><br/>The purpose of Mountain Day is "to obtain an opportunity to become familiar with mountains, and to thank to benefits of the mountains."<br/><br/>Actually, the day is not derived from events related to mountains.<br/><br/>Some organizations such as Japanese Alpine Club had requested the establishment of Mountain Day since 2010, then the day was finally enacted in 2014 and executed from 2016.<br/><br/>Therefore, today is the first Mountain Day.<br/><br/>At first, some people thought that Mountain Day should be June along to the mountain climbing season.<br/><br/>However, since it was convenient for many people to connect the day to Bon vacation, it became August.<br/><br/>By the way, summer vacation of my university has started from yesterday, I have little relevance to Mountain Day.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "aka no tanin."<br/><br/>"Aka" means "red," "tanin" means "a stranger," and "aka no tanin" means "a complete stranger."<br/><br/>Since the word "aka" comes from "akiraka," which means "obvious" or "clear," it contains such meanings in addition to "red," and is sometimes used for emphasizing a noun as in the above example.<br/><br/>(By the way, "kuro" (black) comes from "kurai," which means "dark.")<br/><br/>As similar examples, there are "makka na uso" (a red lie) and "aka ppaji" (a red shame).<br/><br/>"Makka na uso" means "an absolute lie" or "an utter lie," and "aka ppaji" means "a mortal shame" or "an open disgrace."

<div class="date" hidden>Aug 7, 2016 16:39</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Rio Olympic Games began yesterday.<br/><br/>Today, I'd like to talk about some Olympic trivia related to Japan.<br/><br/>In the Stockholm Summer Games in 1912, Japan participated in an Olympic for the first time, and the event was men's track and field.<br/><br/>In the Amsterdam Summer Games in 1928, Japan got the first gold medal in a triple jump.<br/><br/>Also, recent Japanese medalists often take a picture while biting the medals.<br/><br/>(The first person to bite a medal was Armstrong, which won the men's swimming 200 m free style in the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988. It is said that the reason why he bit his gold medal is to check whether or not the medal was real gold.)<br/><br/>There are pros and cons about the biting act, but Japanese Olympic Committee decided officially that biting medals is a prohibited act from the Sochi Winter Games in 2014.

<div class="date" hidden>Aug 6, 2016 16:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese idiom "ichi ka bachi ka."<br/><br/>"Ichi" means "one," "ka" means "or," "bachi" means "eight," and "ichi ka bachi ka" means something like "I don't know what the result will be, but I'll take my chances."<br/><br/>(My dictionary says that "ichi ka bachi ka" means "all or nothing," "sink or swim," or "hit or miss.")<br/><br/>This is originally a gambling term, and it's said that "ichi" (一) and "hachi" (八) comes from the top parts of kanji of "cho" (丁) and "han" (半), respectively.<br/><br/>(In the past, we mainly bet on whether the sum of two dice would be even (cho) or odd (han) in gambling places.)<br/><br/>There is another theory that insists "ichi ka bachi ka" comes from "ichi ka batsu ka" (the dice shows one, or you will receive punishment.). <br/><br/>Anyway, the etymology is gambling using dice.

<div class="date" hidden>Aug 5, 2016 23:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "nekojita" (cat's tongue).<br/><br/>Nekojita means people who can't eat hot food/drink.<br/><br/>The etymology is tied to a fact that cats don't prefer to eat hot things.<br/><br/>However, there are no large individual differences in sensitivities of human tongues, and the main cause of nekojita is a usage of tongues.<br/><br/>People who have nekojita feel hot, because they touch hot things on the tip of their tongues that are very sensitive.<br/><br/>On the other hand, people who don't have nekojita touch food/drink on the center of their tongues while placing the tip of tongues on the back side of the teeth.<br/><br/>Therefore, you might overcome nekojita to some extent by changing the way of using your tongues.

Tabasco sauce is a pungent seasoning that is made from a Mexican pepper called Chile Tabasco.<br/><br/>It is often seen as a byword for a hot sauce, and is used for various dishes in many homes all over the world.<br/><br/>Tabasco sauce is made by maturing mashed Tabasco peppers in a oak barrels for three years.<br/><br/>This process has not changed since Tabasco was invented in 1868.<br/><br/>The inventor, Edmund McIlhenny originally formulated the manufacturing method of Tabasco for raw oysters, which are his favorite food.<br/><br/>Japanese people often use it for Italian cuisine, such as pasta or pizza.<br/><br/>However, I heard Italian people don't use Tabasco sauce for Italian cuisine.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "dasoku."<br/><br/>"Da" means "snake," "soku" means "feet," and "dasoku" expresses "superfluous things" or "unnecessary acts."<br/><br/>(Google translate said that dasoku is "icing on the cake.")<br/><br/>The etymology of dasoku is derived from the following Chinese story:<br/><br/>In the country of Chu, alcohol was given to servants in a festival.<br/><br/>However, since it was small in amount, they decided that only the first person who finished drawing a snake can drink all of the alcohol.<br/><br/>A man finished drawing a snake, and he added the snakes feet while grabbing the alcohol, but his victory became invalid because snakes don't have feet.<br/><br/>From this story, dasoku (snake's feet) comes to express "superfluous things."<br/><br/>Japanese people sometimes say "it might be dasoku, but ..." when we state our opinions in a condescending attitude.

Today, I will talk about a traditional Japanese cake called botamochi.<br/><br/>Botamochi is a rice cake wrapped in sweet bean paste.<br/><br/>This rice cake is made by boiling/steaming sticky rice and non-glutinous rice, pounding them lightly, and making it into a ball.<br/><br/>Also, there is a Japanese cake called "ohagi," which is almost the same as botamochi.<br/><br/>There are several theories that explain the difference between botamochi and ohagi, but I think that the theory, which insists that the name depend on the season, is widely accepted.<br/><br/>Since botan (tree peonies) bloom in the spring, botamochi is a spring mochi (rice cakes).<br/><br/>Since hagi (bush clovers) bloom in autumn, ohagi is an autumn mochi.<br/><br/>By the way, there is a famous saying "tana kara botamochi" (botamochi falls from a shelf into one's mouth), which expresses an unexpected lucky.<br/><br/>This saying is often referred to as "tanabota" for short.

There are a large number of vending machines in Japan.<br/><br/>Although I also use them, sometimes they don't recognize money, and the money comes back.<br/><br/>In such cases, I think people will change the put speed of the coin, or stretch the wrinkles of the bill, but these acts don't work at all.<br/><br/>The speed of coins becomes constant, and the wrinkles of bills are calibrated in the vending machine.<br/><br/>The main reason that vending machines don't recognize money is greasy dirt on the surface.<br/><br/>Therefore, when your money isn't recognized, you should wipe the money using a cloth or something.

Today was a really busy day.<br/><br/>I went to my university in the early morning, and talked about studies with students for about seven hours in total, and wrote a manuscript of an academic conference for about seven hours.<br/><br/>Since students have to perform a study presentation, they seemed to be under the gun.<br/><br/>However, I was really under the gun, because the deadline of the manuscript was today.<br/><br/>I was able to submit it in the last minute, so I'm being quite relieved now.<br/><br/>This entry, that I decided to post every day, was also submitted in the last minute.<br/><br/>I am really tired today.<br/><br/>Good night.

In Japan, there is a superstition that you will die when you get hiccups 100 times continuously.<br/><br/>Since I was afraid of this when I was a child, I had counted the number of hiccups.<br/><br/>However in most cases, I forgot to count it from around 10 times, and hiccups stopped before I was aware.<br/><br/>Also, even if you get hiccups over 100 times, of course you won't die.<br/><br/>An American, Mr. Osborne, continued to get hiccups for about 68 years, and this fact is listed in the Guinness Book of World.<br/><br/>While getting hiccups, he got married two times, and had eight children.<br/><br/>It is estimated that the number of hiccups he got in his lifetime was over 430 million.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "urusai."<br/><br/>"Uru" means "your heart," "sai" means "to narrow," and "urusai" originally expresses "your heart becomes narrowed by something disturbing."<br/><br/>Accordingly, it comes to mean "noisy."<br/><br/>"Urusai" is normally written as "煩い" in Kanji, but it's sometimes written as "五月蝿い."<br/><br/>"五月蝿" means " flies in May," and the reason why the kanji is used is because flies in May are very noisy and annoying.<br/><br/>Note that we don't read "五月蝿" as "うるさ" at other cases.

I love nori (dried seaweed, or laver), and often eat it.<br/><br/>Not only is nori used for rice balls and rolled sushi, but is often boiled down in soy and eaten.<br/><br/>It is also known as healthy food, which contains a lot of protein, vitamin, mineral, are dietary fiber.<br/><br/>I heard that many oversea people feel that ita nori (sheeted nori) is similar to carbon papers.<br/><br/>For this reason, nori is used in the inside of rice in California rolls.<br/>(In Japanese rolled sushi, nori is used on the outer side of rice. )<br/><br/>Also, according to a study at Station biologique de Roscoff in France, only Japanese people own bacteria that can digest seaweeds, such as nori, in their bodies.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "oshidori fufu," which means "a happily married couple."<br/><br/>In the past, it was thought that once oshidori (mandarin ducks) pair up, they spend their lifetimes while snuggling each other.<br/><br/>This is the etymology of oshidori fufu.<br/><br/>However, actually a male of oshidori leaves behind a female after she laid eggs, and the male makes a new couple year after year.<br/><br/>It is said that a truly ideal couple is made by cranes.<br/><br/>Once cranes pair up, they will remain a husband and a wife until death in most cases.<br/><br/>Also, if either of them passes away, even if it becomes only bones, the crane will continue to guard the dead body.

Recently, songs of evening cicadas (which are called higurashi in Japan) have come to resound in my university.<br/><br/>Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese phrase "semishigure," which expresses songs of cicadas.<br/><br/>"Semi" means "cicadas," "shigure" means "a drizzling rain," and "semishigure" is a phrase that likens songs of cicadas to sounds of the drizzling rain. <br/><br/>I think that this phrase has an attractive atmosphere compared to saying just "a buzz of cicadas" or "a chorus of cicadas."<br/><br/>This phrase expressed not only sounds but also a scene of summer.<br/><br/>I especially like semishigure by higurashi, and somehow it makes me want to cry.

Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese word "komorebi," which is one of my favorite words.<br/><br/>The komorebi means a scene of sunlight filtering through trees or leaves.<br/><br/>Since sunlight (hi, bi) streams (moreru) between trees (ki, ko), it called komorebi.<br/><br/>Komorebi is beautiful, so if you have time, please search for the word on Google Images.<br/><br/>I heard there is no word in English that corresponds to komorebi.<br/>(It seems to be called "Śreżoga" in Polish.)<br/><br/>I think that Japanese language has a lot of words that describe scenes of nature.<br/><br/>By the way, I like reddish komorebi in the evening.

Turkeys are the largest species among Galliformes, and they are often cooked on Thanksgiving in the US, and Christmas in the UK.<br/><br/>Turkeys are called "shichimencho" (shichi means seven, men means a face, and cho means a bird) in Japan.<br/><br/>The reason is because their skins from heads to necks are exposed, and these regions changed to red, blue, and purple.<br/><br/>Therefore, people call those who change their feelings easily "shichimencho" in some areas in Japan.<br/><br/>Although turkeys were imported into Japan in the Meiji period, since it's difficult to obtain them, they are treated as an expensive ingredient.<br/><br/>I'd like to eat a whole roasted turkey someday.

Today, I'd like to talk about the phrase "tuki ga kirei desune," which sometimes becomes a hot topic.<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "the moon is beautiful, isn't it?," but this phrase might include the meaning of "I love you."<br/><br/>It is said that a Japanese famous novelist and teacher Natsume Soseki said when he heard his student translated "I love you" into "ware kimi o aisu" (ware means I, kimi means you, and aisu means love):<br/><br/>"Japanese people don't use such an expression, you should say 'the moon is beautiful isn't it?'."<br/><br/>That is, he mentioned that Japanese can understand the true meaning, even if you don't use words of love.<br/><br/>This expression is often thought of as affectional, graceful, and beautiful.<br/><br/>However, it might not actually convey the meaning of "I love you," please be careful.

Recently, I often hear that Pokemon GO is becoming popular in the world.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether or not it made an effect, but a lyrics of  Pikachu's theme song "Pikachu no uta" (Pikachu's song) was published yesterday.<br/><br/>The stock price of Nintendo reached more than double for the price of before Pokemon GO was released.<br/><br/>It was composed of only Pikachu's call, there were a lot of "pika" and "pikachu."<br/><br/>A part of the lyrics is something like the following:<br/><br/>Pikkachu pikkachu pika pika pikachu pika pika<br/><br/>I can't understand what the song means at all.<br/><br/>However, somehow I'd like to listen to this song at least once.

Do you know Tottori Prefecture, which has the smallest population in Japan?<br/><br/>The most popular sightseeing spot in Tottori Prefecture is "Tottori Sand Dunes."<br/><br/>Tottori Sand Dunes is a vast dunes area, which spreads to Japan coast, and you can enjoy sightseeing by a camel, a horse-drawn carriage, or foot.<br/><br/>However, I heard that recently Tottori Sand Dunes has become gradually grasslands.<br/><br/>Therefore, Tottori Prefecture has gotten rid of weeds on a large scale for saving the natural asset, Tottori Sand Dunes.<br/><br/>While many countries all over the world try to prevent desertification, only Tottori prefecture might try to prevent greening.

There are some ways of calling your mother in Japan.<br/><br/>The most popular expression is "okaasan" or "kaasan." <br/><br/>Recently, the other expression "mama" has also become gradually popular.<br/><br/>In many Japanese home, we have our children say "mama" and "papa" instead of "okaasan" and "otousan" because of the ease of pronunciation, and they seems to become household words.<br/><br/>On the other hand, we (especially men) sometimes call our mothers "ofukuro."<br/><br/>There are some theories of the etymology: <br/><br/>・In the past, mothers managed property of their homes by putting them into bags ("fukuro" means "a bag").<br/><br/>・We grow up in our mother's bosom ("bosom" is called "futokoro" in Japan).<br/><br/>I think that the saying "ofukuro" is cool, but I missed the timing of switching to "ofukuro" from "okaasan."

Today, I will talk about the Japanese slang "bokenasu."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "bokenasu" is "a faded eggplant," but it is used as an abuse that means "idiot" in common.<br/>(Actually, both "boke" and "nasu" could be an abuse.)<br/><br/>Also, there is the similar phrase "otanko nasu," which means "stupid" or "lubber."<br/>(There are several theories about the etymology, but it's not clear.)<br/><br/>In Japan, there are many abuses that contain vegetables in addition to "bokenasu" and "otankonasu."<br/><br/>Even if you say just vegetable names to someone, such as "nasu" (eggplants), "imo" (potatoes), "kabocha" (pumpkin), or "moyashi" (sprouts), it might become an abuse, so please be careful.

Today, I'd like to talk about the problem called "Buffon's needle," which was posed by mathematician Buffon.<br/><br/>This problem is something like the following:<br/><br/>1. Suppose you draw parallel lines with the same width on a floor, and drop a needle there.<br/><br/>2. What is the probability that the needle and any of the lines cross.<br/><br/>If the width between lines is 2 cm, and the length of the needle is 1 cm, the probability will become 1/π.<br/><br/>This means that you can obtain an approximate value of pi by dropping needles.<br/><br/>Mathematician Lasagna dropped a needle 3,408 times, and obtained the approximation of pi, 355/113 (equals 3.1419529...).<br/><br/>By the way, conducting this experiment on a computer is meaningless, because you need the value of pi when you generate a needle's angle randomly or check whether or not the needle and lines cross.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese formula in letters, "ご自愛ください (gojiai kudasai)." <br/><br/>The literal meaning is "please love yourself," and it's used as the meaning of "take care of yourself" or "I hope your health is good."<br/><br/>This expression is thought of as beautiful, and is often appended at the end of letters.<br/><br/>If you type "gojiai" and convert it into kanji, it may become "ご慈愛."<br/><br/>However, since the meaning is quite different from "ご自愛," please be careful to convert it.<br/><br/>If you say "ご慈愛ください (gojiai kudasai)," it means something like "please give me your deep love."<br/>(This phrase is sometimes used for God or Buddha.)

Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese job category "miyadaiku."<br/><br/>Daiku means carpenters, and miyadaiku means carpenters who build and repair only traditional Japanese architectures, such as temples and shrines.<br/><br/>Temples and shrines are built by using a unique Japanese construction method called "kigumi" (timberwork), which don't use nails or bolts.<br/><br/>Kigumi is a method that builds architectures by combining timbers that are logged to complex shapes.<br/><br/>If the height of the architecture is high, miyadaiku will design it so as to distribute the gravity.<br/><br/>Since this technique is important to preserve cultural assets, it is designated as a selected preservation technique.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Japan, when children fall down or get injured, their parents often say "itaino itaino tondeike~," (pain, pain, go away~) while rubbing the affected area.<br/><br/>This act is often thought as a kind of charm, but it seems to have actual effects.<br/><br/>According to a study at Gunma University, the act of rubbing could promote the restoration/regeneration of your peripheral nerves.<br/><br/>In addition, since children can feel their parents' love, their fears of injury disappear, and the pain seems to be allowed relief indirectly.<br/><br/>Also, it is said that placebo effects by what the words mean could affect the pain.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Since the House of Councilors election is being held today, I will tell you about three trivia that are related to Japanese elections.<br/><br/>【No. 1】<br/>In Japan, only a person who come to a polling station can confirm that there is no ballot in the ballot box. Some people seem to get up very early for confirming the ballot box.<br/><br/>【No. 2】<br/>When the number of a runner's votes is the same as another runner's one, the result will be eventually tolerated by lot. This way might be the same in many countries overseas.<br/><br/>【No. 3】<br/>Payments of Snacks/sweet treats for election staff are defined as up to a ceiling of 500 yen per day by law. Payments of bento (lunch bags) are up to 1000 yen per one meal.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to tell you about the Japanese expression "ototoi kiyagare."<br/><br/>"Ototoi" means "the day before yesterday," "kiyagare" means "come," and "ototoi kiyagare" means something like "get out, don't come again."<br/><br/>There are two theories that are related to the etymology of this expression.<br/><br/>One of them is that since "ototoi" has also the meaning of "distant day," "ototoi kiyagare" originally meant "don't come until the distant day."<br/><br/>The other one is that since to come the day after yesterday is impossible, "ototoi kiyagare" meant "it's too late."<br/><br/>There are a similar phrase in English; "come when two Sundays meet."

Previously, I wrote about changes of chameleon's body color, but today I will talk about chameleon's tongue.<br/><br/>As you may know, chameleons catch their food by stretching their long sticky tongues.<br/><br/>Chameleons have very long tongues that are 1.5 to 2 times longer than their body length, and the tongues are normally folded like an accordion.<br/><br/>Also, chameleons launch their tongues at a very high speed by using special muscles around from the tip to the root of the tongue.<br/><br/>According to a study from Brown University, the acceleration of a chameleon's tongue achieves up to 264 gravities.<br/><br/>If the tongue were to be a car, the speed would reach a speed of 90 kilometers per hour in only 0.01 seconds.

Today was Tanabata.<br/><br/>Tanabata (July 7) is the Star Festival, and is a day of the turn of the season in China, Japan, Vietnam, etc.<br/><br/>In the Tanabata, we often write our wishes on a strips of paper, and hang them on bamboo branches.<br/><br/>Originally in China, there was a custom of praying so as to improve accomplishments.<br/><br/>It was brought into Japan in the Edo period, and we came to write a wish for improvements of our calligraphy skills on strips of paper.<br/><br/>In the course of time, the custom gradually became something like "if you write your wish, it will come true."

Nara Park, which is located in Nara Prefecture of Japan, has about 660 hectares, and is well known that a plenty deer are living there.<br/><br/>The number is no less than 1500, and you can see deer in many places in the park.<br/><br/>In Nara Park, "shika senbei" (deer rice crackers) are sold, and if you buy them, deer around you will approach you.<br/><br/>Also, events called "shikayose" (huddling deer) are sometimes performed by playing a horn, and a herd of deer in the event is worth seeing.<br/><br/>Few years ago, images/videos of deer in Nara Park became small news, because deer seemed to obey the traffic signals.<br/><br/>Since deer can't identify the color of the signals, they might wait for cars to stop or be attuned to around people.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think they are a very smart animal.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The saying "cast pearls before swine" came from a Bible verse, and means that it is in vain to give valuable things to someone who don't understand the value.<br/><br/>The Japanese translation version "buta ni shinju" (pearls to swine), which has the same meaning, is also famous in Japan.<br/><br/>Actually, there is the other saying "neko ni koban," (oval gold coind to cats) which has completely the same meaning of "cast pearls before swine" in Japan.<br/><br/>Since Japanese versions have no verbs, it might be a little difficult to understand with no background information.<br/><br/>Also, as other sayings that mean ineffective things, there are "inu ni rongo" (Analects to dogs), "uma no mimi ni nenbutsu" (Buddhist chants to horse's ears), and "kaeru no tsura ni mizu" (water to frog's faces).<br/><br/>You can see a variety of animals in Japanese sayings.

Today, I'd like to explain the difference between the Japanese verbs "nejiru" and "hineru," which have the similar meaning.<br/><br/>Although both of them can be translated into English as "twist" or "quirk," the nuances are different.<br/><br/>"Nejiru" expresses "to rotate both ends of a rod-like object in the opposite direction with a strong force," and "hineru" expresses "tp rotate something in a certain direction with a weak force."<br/><br/>For example:<br/>Harigane o nejiru (twist wires)<br/>Jaguchi o hineru (turn on/run a water tap)<br/><br/>Also, "hineru" has other meanings, such as "puzzle over," and "tricky."<br/><br/>For example:<br/>Muzukashi mondai ni atama o hineru (puzzle over a difficult problem)<br/>Hinetta mondai o teian suru (propose a tricky question)

Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese phrase "tsumaranai," which means "boring."<br/><br/>"Tsumaranai" is composed of the verb "tsumaru" and the negative auxiliary verb "-nai."<br/><br/>"Tsumaru" has several meanings, such as "choke," "jam," "get stuck," and "be settled."<br/><br/>However, "tsumaranai" has the meanings of "boring" and "silly," which were derived from "be not settled."<br/><br/>Note that if you say "tsumaru," it will never mean something like "interesting," which is an antonym of "boring."<br/><br/>There is the similar phrase "kudaranai," which means "boring," but the meaning will never become "interesting," even if you remove the negative auxiliary verb "-nai" and say "kudaaru."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese phrases "suzume no namida" and "neko no hitai."<br/><br/>Suzume means sparrows, namida means tears, and "suzume no namida" is a phrase for expressing very small quantity.<br/><br/>For example: Suzume no namida hodo no kyuryo (A salary as much as sparrow's tears)<br/><br/>There is also the phrase "neko no hitai," which is similar to "suzume no namida."<br/><br/>Neko means cats, hitai means a forehead, and "neko no hitai" is a phrase for expressing very narrow area.<br/><br/>For example: Neko no hitai hodo no tochi (A place as large as a cat's forehead)<br/><br/>Also, "unagi no nedoko" (an eel's bed) is a phrase for expressing a narrow  and long space.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A leap second is a second that is added or deleted so that the difference between UT1 (Universal Time based on the rotation of the Earth) and UTC (Universal Time based on an atomic clock) doesn't become more than one second.<br/><br/>Some websites say something like that adjustments by leap seconds are needed because the rotation speed of the Earth is gradually slowing, but this reason is not true.<br/><br/>Although the rotation speed of the Earth is gradually slowing indeed, the amount is about one millisecond per one century, so it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>The actual reason seems to be because the pace of the International Atomic Time is slightly different from the pace of the Earth's rotation.<br/><br/>Totally 36 leap seconds have been added since the introduction of the leap year in 1972.<br/><br/>However, if the pace of the International Atomic Time was completely correct one, the total leap seconds of additions and deletion would be only three seconds.<br/><br/>By the way, the adjustments by leap seconds are conducted on June 30 or December 31.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are many AEDs (Automated External Defibrillators) in Japanese towns, and the penetration rate is highest in the world.<br/><br/>However, since the utilization rate is a low 3.7%, we need to learn more about AEDs.<br/><br/>Actually, I've thought that an AED is a device that gives a patient in cardiac arrest an electric shock, and restart the heart.<br/><br/>In fact, I think that I've watched such scenes in some dramas.<br/><br/>However, AEDs are a device for removing ventricular fibrillation (which is a state that the ventricle cramps and blood don't flow), and basically cannot resuscitate stopped hearts.<br/><br/>Since you cannot feel any pulse in both cases of ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest, you need to check the electrocardiogram to confirm the patient's state.<br/><br/>If the state is cardiac arrest, you should apply cardiac massage.

Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese cuisine "hormone."<br/><br/>The hormone is a standard menu of barbecue restaurants in Japan, and means innards that includes small bowel, large bowel, livers and hearts of cattle or birds.<br/><br/>Since "hormone" is written in Katakana, I've thought that this word came from "hormone" in English.<br/><br/>However, I found some sites that says something like "hormone is came from the Japanese phrase 'hourumonn,' which means things that you throw away," then I was surprised and impressed.<br/><br/>After few hours, I realized that I was completely deceived.<br/><br/>According to a more reliable source, we referred to cuisine that enhance endocrine hormone as just "hormone," and now it mainly shows innards cuisine.

There are magnetic prepaid cards for books in Japan, that are called "tosho cards."<br/><br/>Tosho cards have been familiar as gifts of anniversary or supplementary prizes in small contests for more than 25 years.<br/><br/>However, "tosho card NEXT" was launched from this month.<br/><br/>In the tosho card NEXT, since the usage history and the balances are managed on a server, you can check the information by using smartphone or computers.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in previous tosho cards, you can check only rough balances by looking punched holes on the card.<br/><br/>Personally, I prefer previous cards because when you want to check the balances of new cards, you have to connect the Internet and input an ID number and a PIN number.

Today, I will talk about the differences between geckos ("yamori" in Japanese) and newts ("imori" in Japanese).<br/><br/>Japanese people often them because they have not only similar shapes, but also similar Japanese names.<br/><br/>Geckos are reptiles, and are a member of the lizard family, while newts are amphibians, and are a member of the frog family.<br/><br/>Therefore, while skins of geckos are dry, skins of newts are wet.<br/><br/>Also, while geckos can regenerate only their tails, newts can regenerate their various parts (however, only geckos can do autotomy).<br/><br/>By the way, it is said that "geckos protect our houses from pests" 「ie (can be called "ya") o gaichu kara mamoru」, and "newts protect wells from pests" 「ido o gaichu kara mamoru」.<br/><br/>This is why geckos are called "yamori," and newts are called "imori" in Japan.

Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese conjunction "dakara."<br/><br/>"Dakara" has the meaning of "hence" or "so," but you have to be careful to use this at the beginning of a sentence.<br/><br/>Basically, since "dakara" is used to even or lower ranking people, it's possible to make someone feel bad.<br/><br/>Recently, many Japanese people use "nanode" instead of "dakara," as an alternative expression.<br/><br/>Although "nanode" is a softer expression, it's not a independent conjunction, so you can't use it strictly at the beginning of a sentence.<br/><br/>If you want to use correct Japanese, you can use "shitagatte," "ijo no kotokara," "sonotame," or "desunode," though these are stiff and formal.

Today, I will talk about the way to increase your hair.<br/><br/>According to a study of the University of Southern California, if you pull 200 hairs out from a mouse body in a narrow region, about two to six times hairs of the pulled ones will grow.<br/><br/>The reason seems to be because a grow signal is sent to surrounding sleeping hair roots by pulling a hair out.<br/><br/>However, if you want to reproduce it, you have to pull your hair out one by one in a closely spaced region.<br/><br/>Worst of all,if the region is too large, chemical signals will weaken, and no hair grow.<br/><br/>It's a kind of horrible way, you can't do this casually.

Broccoli is a kind of cruciferous vegetables, and is known for the very rich nutritional value.<br/><br/>In the US, broccoli is known familiarly as a symbol of health, but many children seem to hate broccoli.<br/><br/>Although many Japanese children hate broccoli too, the symbol of unpopular vegetables for children in Japan tends to be bell peppers or carrots.<br/><br/>In fact, in the Japanese version of the Pixar movie "Inside Out," a father force to his child to eat green peppers instead of broccoli. <br/><br/>By the way, broccoli is a cabbage that was bred in Italy.<br/><br/>Also, cauliflower is a mutation of broccoli.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "daijobu."<br/><br/>"Daijobu" means something like "it's okay" or "no problem," and is often used in daily life.<br/><br/>For example: "Ashita yasundemo iidesuka?" "Daijobu desu."<br/>("Can I take a day off tomorrow?" "No problem.")<br/><br/>However, you have to be careful because "daijobu" has also meanings like "it's enough" and "no thank you."<br/><br/>For example: "Gohan tabeni ikanai?" "Daijobu desu."<br/>("How about going out for lunch?" "No thank you.")<br/><br/>Originally, "daijobu" meant only affirmative, but it has come to be used also in negative meanings, because direct denials might bruise someone.<br/><br/>Since the usage of "daijobu" is really confusing even for us, I recommend for you to add supplemental words after saying "daijobu."

Today was the summer solstice in Japan.<br/><br/>The summer solstice is a day that the daytime is longest and the night is shortest in a year in the Northern Hemisphere (this reverses in the Southern Hemisphere).<br/><br/>In the Japanese summer solstice, the sun rises about five hours longer than the winter solstice, which has the shortest daytime in a year.<br/><br/>Actually, there are almost no traditional events related to the summer solstice in Japan.<br/><br/>In Europe, on the other hand, many festivals to thank the sun seem to be held during the summer solstice.<br/><br/>For example, I heard that the day is "Fête de la musique" (Make Music Day) in French.<br/><br/>Also, the day seems to be a day that symbolizes love in various European countries.<br/><br/>In particular, for North European countries that have relatively short daylight hours, the summer solstice (midsummer) is one of the most important holidays.

Today, I noticed a little weird Japanese words.<br/><br/>They are "kin-nen" and "kin-jitsu."<br/><br/>"Kin" means "close" and "near," "nen" means "year," and "jitsu" means "day."<br/><br/>Also, "kin-nen" means "recently" or "in recent years," which includes the recent past and the present.<br/><br/>However, "kin-jitsu" means "soon" or "in a few days," which shows only near future.<br/><br/>Although these structures are similar, the meanings are quite different.<br/><br/>Please be careful when you use these words.<br/><br/>By the way, there are no words like "kin-shu" ("shu" means "week") and "kin-getsu" ("getsu" means "month").

Today, I will talk about the Japanese verbs "omou" and "kangaeru."<br/><br/>Both of them can be translated into "think" in English, but the nuances are different.<br/><br/>Commonly, "omou" is used to show a thought that is based on your feeling or subjective view.<br/><br/>On the other hand, "kangaeru" is used to show a thought that is based on your analysis or objective view.<br/><br/>Also, "kangaeru" can reinforce your confidence to your thought.<br/><br/>Therefore, "kangaeru" is mainly used at scientific sentences and formal speeches.<br/><br/>"Omou" is basically used in everyday conversation.

<div class="date" hidden>Jun 18, 2016 17:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are many Japanese words that express the end of flowers depending on the kind.<br/><br/>Today, I will talk about some typical ones among them.<br/><br/>Sakura (cherry blossoms) ･･･ "Chiru" (which literally means "dissipate")<br/><br/>(A scene that cherry blossoms are falling is called "sakura hubuki" (hubuki means blowing snow).)<br/><br/>Kiku (chrysanthemums) ･･･ "Koboreru" (which literally means "dance")<br/><br/>(Petals of withered chrysanthemums droop, it looks like they're dancing when winds are blowing.)<br/><br/>Ume (Plums) ･･･ "Koboreru" (which literally means "spill")<br/><br/>Tsubaki (Camellias) ･･･ "Ochiru" (which literally means "fall")<br/><br/>Botan (Peonies) ･･･ "Kuzureru" (which literally means "collapse")<br/><br/>Asagao (morning glories) ･･･ "Shibomu" (which literally means "deflate")<br/><br/>Yukiyanagi (spiraea thunbergii) ･･･ "Fubuku" (which literally means that blowing snow occurs)<br/><br/>We've expressed scenes of the end of flowers by using various words.<br/><br/>It's not necessarily required to use these expressions to each flower.<br/><br/>However, I think that it's beautiful to express visual scenes by using such special expressions.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "taidan."<br/><br/>"Taidan" is often translated into "talk," "conversation," or "interview," but it's wrong in a narrow sense.<br/><br/>"Tai" in "taidan" have the meanings of "pair" and "one-to-one," and "dan" have the meaning of "conversation."<br/><br/>Therefore, "taidan" means a "one-on-one conversation/dialogue," and it's not used when there are more than three speakers.<br/><br/>Although a three-way conversation is defined as "teidan" in Japan, the phrase is not popular very much.<br/><br/>In my opinion, if there are more than three speakers, you should say "kaigi," "kaidan," "meeting,"or "hanashi-ai."

Today, I will talk about "unagi-bun" (eel statements).<br/><br/>The "unagi-bun" expresses something like the following conversation in a restaurant.<br/><br/>A「Nani o chumon suru?」("Did you decide what to order?")<br/>B「Boku ha unagi da.」("I'm an eel.")<br/>C「Watashi ha beer.」("I'm beer.")<br/><br/>These speakers are of course neither an eel nor beer, they just showed their orders.<br/><br/>When you say 「X ha Y da」 (X is Y) in Japan, it doesn't always mean "X equals Y," and such statements are called "unagi-bun" (eel statements).<br/><br/>Although the term itself is not famous, Japanese people often use this grammar.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether or not similar examples exist overseas.

Today, I'll talk about the phrase "okagesama," which is often used in Japan.<br/><br/>"Kage" means a shade of the great, such as Shinto or Buddhist deities, and the polite version "okagesama" is used as an appreciation word for other people's help.<br/><br/>Example: 「Okagesama de shoshin dekimasita.」 (Thanks to you, I got promoted.)<br/><br/>Such "okagesama" in the good sense is also used lightheartedly in various situations (even if your conversation partner actually don't help you), something like the following:<br/><br/>A: 「Genki desu ka?」("How are you doing?")<br/><br/>B: 「Okagesama de genki desu.」("Thanks to you, I'm fine.")<br/><br/>In fact, "okagesama" seems to be sometimes translated into "fortunately."<br/><br/>On the other hand, "okagesama" is also used in the sense of irony.<br/><br/>Example: 「Okagesama de shippai shimashita.」 "Thanks to you, I failed."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese words "amato" and "karato," which are often misused.<br/><br/>"Ama" in "amato" means "sweet," "kara" in "karato" means "spicy," and "to" means "(political) party."<br/><br/>Therefore, most Japanese people think that "amato" means people who like sweets, and "karato" means people who like spicy food literary.<br/><br/>However, the original meanings are something like the following:<br/><br/>Amato: People who prefer sweets than sake (alcohol).<br/><br/>Karato: People who prefer sake (alcohol) to sweets.<br/><br/>The meaning of "amato" is almost correct, but that of "karato" is dramatically different from the original.<br/><br/>One of the most widely-accepted theories that explain why "karato" means people who like sake is that high alcohol sake that have a low sugar content is called "辛い" (spicy) in Japan.

Today, I will talk about tip of the tongue (TOT) phenomenon.<br/><br/>The tip of the tongue phenomenon is a phenomenon that though you're about to recall something, you can't.<br/><br/>There are some cases: you're retrieving a similar sound word that has a different meaning, you're retrieving a similar meaning word that has a different sound, you're retrieving only a first character of the word, and so on.<br/><br/>Memory retrieval of human beings is sophisticated and is performed quite quickly, but the speed will become slow when you're in the TOT states.<br/><br/>By the way, the phenomenon is called "nodo made dekakatteiru" (which means something like "something is about to come to my throat") in Japan.

The word "marron" (マロン) is often used in Japan.<br/><br/>And many Japanese people think that the "marron" is an English loanword, which means "栗 (クリ)."<br/><br/>Actually, I also thought so until today.<br/><br/>However, "marron" is a French loanword, which means "conker," and "栗 (クリ)" is "chestnut" in English ("châtaignes" in French).<br/><br/>The reason why such a misunderstanding became established seems to be that when marron glace imported into Japan, we used chestnuts instead of conkers to make it.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I think chestnuts are very similar to conkers.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
If you've learnt Japanese, you shall know the Japanese word "sayonara," which means "bye."<br/><br/>Although "sayonara" was very common Japanese phrase, it's not used so often these days.<br/><br/>In fact, I don't remember when the last time I said sayonara.<br/><br/>In most cases when we go home, we will say "zyane" (see you) or "matane" (later) to our friends, and say "otsukare sama" (have a nice evening) or "shiturei shimasu" (I'm sorry to leave early) to our bosses or colleagues.<br/><br/>The reason that sayonara isn't used so often seems to be because it sounds a forever farewell.<br/><br/>I heard that native speakers don't say "bood bye" so often in recent years, but the reason might be the same.

According to a survey of Japanese television program, there are coins under vending machines with a probability of about ten percent.<br/><br/>The investigation was actually performed to 300 vending machines, and 2,724 yen was found in total.<br/><br/>This means that an average of 9 yen was found under each vending machine.<br/><br/>Also, about 5.5 million vending machines are installed in Japan.<br/><br/>Therefore, there are about 50 million yen is sleeping under Japanese vending machines.<br/><br/>By the way, I don't know why, but there are many blog posts that says something like "about 51.5 million vending machines are installed in Japan, and there are about 460 million yen under them."<br/><br/>This is of course a lie, there aren't such a large number (nearly half of Japan's population) of vending machines.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese expression "azatoi."<br/><br/>"Azatoi" means that the act is explicit and wily, or it's inconsiderate.<br/><br/>The etymology of azatoi is said to be  "azaru," which means "playful."<br/><br/>(Note that the expression "azaru" is rarely used these days, and "tawamureru," which has the same meaning is used instead.)<br/><br/>Nowadays, the word "azatoi" is often used when women show signs that attract men in a calculated way.<br/><br/>For example, we say 「彼女あざといね」 (means something like "she is very clever).<br/><br/>As examples of the signs, there are "puffing her cheeks," "peeping from beneath her lashes," referring to herself as her first name," etc.

<div class="date" hidden>Jun 5, 2016 16:13</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, tsuyuiri was announced in the Kanto region in Japan.<br/><br/>"Tsuyuiri" means that the tsuyu season begins, and "tsuyu" means the long rain, which lasts for approximately a month around June.<br/><br/>In East Asia, four air masses struggle with each other from spring to summer.<br/><br/>Then, a stationary front called "baiu front" (the meanings of baiu and tsuyu are the same) is formed for thousands kilometers from east to west.<br/><br/>The baiu front moves to the north gradually over several months, and it rains continuously in regions near this front.<br/><br/>Since I often get a headache during the tsuyu season, it's painful to me.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned a law of Mehrabian.<br/><br/>Mehrabian is an American psychologist, and is well known to conduct communication experiments.<br/><br/>The famous experiment is how listeners are affected by speaker's attitudes and behavior when the speaker's message conflicts.<br/><br/>For example, speakers got angry to listeners with smiles, and encouraged to listeners with brooding looks in the experiment.<br/><br/>As a result, the effect rates were found: words account for 7%, tone of voice accounts for 38%, and body language accounts for 55% (the 7%-38%-55% Rule).<br/><br/>However, this rule was exaggerated, and is often interpreted as "appearances and expressions are more important than the what people say. "<br/><br/>I think that one of the reasons is because the book named "hito ha mitame ga 9 wari" (90% of the important things of people is the appearance), which misunderstand the Mehrabian's experiment, became a bestseller in Japan.

Today, I will talk about an undersea postbox in Wakayama Prefecture in Japan.<br/><br/>As the name implies, this postbox is located under the sea.<br/><br/>The distance from shore is 100 meters, and the depth is 10 meters, so you have to prepare diving to put a letter in the postbox.<br/><br/>An average of ten letters per day are dropped, and a diver collects them everyday, then they are delivered throughout Japan.<br/><br/>In 2002, this postbox was recognized in the Guinness Book of Records for the deepest underwater postbox.<br/><br/>By the way, since the undersea postbox is deteriorated by shellfish and seaweeds, it is replaced once a year.

Today, I will talk about puffer fish (fugu) that the Japanese love.<br/><br/>Puffer fish is known to have a deadly poison called tetrodotoxin.<br/><br/>Tetrodotoxin is 1000 times stronger than potassium cyanide, and has an immediate effect; you will die about five hours after you intake the toxin.<br/><br/>Therefore, if you want to cook puffer fish, you have to be licensed puffer fish chef.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, one person dies annually due to puffer fish.<br/><br/>However, many Japanese people like the taste of puffer fish, and we will continue to eat them.<br/><br/>By the way, since cuisines that use puffer fish are very expensive, I can rarely eat them, haha.

<div class="date" hidden>May 31, 2016 09:55</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "kakin."<br/><br/>"Ka" in kakin means to assess something, and "kin" in kakin means money, so "kakin" means something like "to charge a fee."<br/><br/>Because free-to-play games that collect surcharges have increased lately, the word "kakin" came to be used frequently in Japan.<br/><br/>However, I think that many Japanese youth say "kakin-suru" (charge a fee) when they spend their money on games.<br/><br/>To charge a fee is done by a game development company, and what they are doing is "nokin" or "siharai" (to pay money) .<br/><br/>Similarly, I think many Japanese say "bokin-suru," which means to collect contributions, when they contribute money (this act is actually "kifu").

Today, I will talk about the unit "barrel," which is used for representing a volume.<br/><br/>The "barrel" is often used to represent the amount of oil, but there are various definitions depending on applications or countries.<br/><br/>For the amount of oil, one barrel is defined as 42 US gallons (about 160 liters).<br/><br/>In the US, one fluid barrel is 31.5 US fluid gallons (about 119 liters), and one beer barrel is 31 fluid gallons (about 117 liters).<br/><br/>Also, a dry barrel that is used for grains and vegetables 105 dry quarts (about 116 liters).<br/><br/>In the UK, one beer barrel is 36 UK gallons (about 164 litres).<br/><br/>Since these units, barrel and gallon are rarely used in Japan, it's very confusing for me.

Yesterday, I was talk about octopuses.<br/><br/>Today, I will talk about the Japanese slang "tako ashi haisen" (octopus's tentacles wiring), which was derived from octopus.<br/><br/>In Japan, we refer to putting too many plugs in one outlet as "tako ashi haisen."<br/><br/>We liken the many cables to octopus's  tentacles.<br/><br/>It's said that the reason why the slang uses "octopus" instead of "squid" is because cables extend in four directions like octopus's tentacles.<br/><br/>If you increase tako ashi too much, it may take fire or deliver an electric shock, so please be careful.

The number of octopus legs is normally eight.<br/>(There is an octopus that has 96 legs.)<br/><br/>We sometimes call them "legs," but most academic books call them "arms" or "tentacles."<br/><br/>Also, I heard that a European study group have researched on octopus legs and arms.<br/><br/>According to the study, it was found that the number of octopus legs is two, and the number of octopus arms is six.<br/><br/>Octopuses use their two backward tentacles to move, and their six forward tentacles to find food or loop up something.<br/><br/>By the way, octopuses have three hearts and nine brains.

Since it rained today, I will talk about the Japanese proverb "ame ga furu hi ha tenki ga warui," which means "a rainy is a bad weather day."<br/><br/>You might think something like "it's normal, what you want to say?"<br/><br/>You're right, this proverb refers to things that doesn't need to be said.<br/><br/>Also, there are some proverbs that have the same meaning.<br/><br/>Foe example, "inu ga nisi mukya o ha higashi" (if a dog look towards the west, the tail will look toward the east), and "oyaji ha ore yori toshi ga ue" (my father is older than me).

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "ocha-suru."<br/><br/>("Ocha" is a noun that means tea, and "suru" is a verb that means do.)<br/><br/>Ocha-suru means to drink something or get rest at a coffee/tea shop.<br/><br/>In 1970s, phrases like "～suru (do something)" were prevalent in Japan.<br/><br/>In addition to "ocha-suru," "eiga-suru (which means to watch a movie)" and "tabaco-suru (which means to smoke)" seemed to be used. <br/><br/>However, the phrase "ocha-shinai? (shall we do tea?)" continues to be used as a pickup line, and only "ocha-suru" still remains.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about a Japanese word "henachoko."<br/><br/>Henachoko is a taunting word that expresses an immature or unimportant person.<br/><br/>"Hena" in henachoko came from an imitative word "henahena" that expresses frail things.<br/><br/>"Choko" in henachoko means something like a small move, and is also used in "chokomaka (move quickly and restlessly)" or "chokozai (cheeky)" in Japanese.<br/><br/>Using this word to others is rude, but I like the sound of "henachoko."

It was when I was leaving a fast food restaurant after I ate dinner, I found a cockroach in the outside.<br/><br/>It was very shocking to me.<br/><br/>I've never found cockroaches while living in Nagano Prefecture, and I met a cockroach for the first time in nine years.<br/><br/>For now, I've never found cockroach in my apartment, but my room doesn't clean very much.<br/><br/>I think that my kitchen is very clean (because I don't cook very much), but there are many cardboard boxes in my room.<br/><br/>Also, I heard that cockroaches like cardboard, and they often deposit their eggs in cardboard boxes.<br/><br/>In order to avoid cockroaches, I will do something with those cardboard boxes.

Yesterday, I went to an outlet mall, and bought some clothes after I finished my work.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I chose and bought a cloth for myself.<br/><br/>I think it's the first in 2 years.<br/><br/>I bought a thin jacket and, some shirts and pants.<br/><br/>Recently, I've worn a few clothes in rotation, so such new clothes will be a good refreshing change for me.<br/><br/>My colleagues might have thought something like "you always wear the same cloth," haha.

Human beings jiggle their legs when they are nervous, and scratch their heads when they feel embarrassed.<br/><br/>This behavior is referred to as "displacement activity," and you can see the same property in many animals, such as cats, dogs, birds, and fish.<br/><br/>When animals can't choose escape or attack though they want to take the actions, they choose a quite different action (displacement activity).<br/><br/>By taking the displacement activity, you can keep your mind stability, or camouflage your true feelings.<br/><br/>It is said that having a large meal is also a kind of displacement activities.

Yesterday, I wrote about beckoning gestures.<br/><br/>Today, I will talk about "maneki neko," which is posing with the beckoning gesture.<br/><br/>Maneki neko is a traditional Japanese kind of figure in the shape of a cat, and is a lucky charm (which is called "engimono" in Japan) for business success.<br/><br/>It is said that maneki with the right forepaw raised brings economic fortune, and that with the left forepaw raised attracts customers.<br/><br/>By the way, the former is a male cat, and the latter is a female cat.<br/><br/>Recently, you can file maneki neko with the both forepaws, but many of us don't like it very much because the gesture implies a surrender.<br/><br/>There are several theories about where the maneki neko came from, and I think that it began when we likened a grooming of a cat to a beckoning gesture.

Today, I will talk about gestures meaning "come here."<br/><br/>In Japan, when we want to express "come here," we wave our fingers with our palms down.<br/><br/>I heard that similar gestures are used with the same meaning in Asian countries, Russia, Greece, and Italy, etc.<br/><br/>However, in the US and European countries except the Mediterranean area, this gesture seems to mean "go away."<br/><br/>In these countries, they wave their fingers with their palms up to express "come here."<br/><br/>There is a Japanese traditional craft called "maneki neko (beckoning cat)," which is posing the "come here" gesture with his palm down.<br/><br/>Today, I learned there is maneki neko with his palm up for international sales.

Japanese beauty salons (and barber shops) are closed every Tuesday in the Kanto region, and every Monday in the other regions.<br/><br/>Around the Second World War, Japan had faced a shortage of electricity.<br/><br/>For this reason, Monday or Tuesday had established as Electricity Outage Day, and most electricity supplies had stopped on the day.<br/><br/>On the other hand, electric perms that had been performed in beauty salons needed a lot of electricity.<br/><br/>Hence, beauty salons were forced to be closed on Mondays or Tuesdays.<br/><br/>This custom has remained until today, and there are many beauty salons that close on Mondays or Tuesdays.

Today, I will talk about "gamu" and "gomu."<br/><br/>"Gamu" is an English loanword, and "gomu" is a Dutch loanword.<br/><br/>These words express different meanings respectively, because when they were imported into Japan, "gamu" expressed mainly "chewing gum," and "gomu" expressed mainly "rubber."<br/><br/>On the other hand, I heard that "gum" in English and "gom" in Dutch express both of their meanings.<br/><br/>By the way, in German, "gummi" expresses all of "gamu," "gomu" and "gumi."<br/><br/>In Japan (maybe also in other countries), both gamu and gumi are a kind of candy, but we refer to ones that disappear by chewing as gumi (gummy).

Today, I will talk about a tongue twister that I can't say.<br/><br/>"Kono takegaki ni take tatekaketano ha take tatekaketakatta kara take tatekaketa."<br/>(The reason why I leaned a bamboo against this bamboo fence is because I wanted to lean a bamboo, so I leaned a bamboo.)<br/><br/>Although it's easy to say "take" and "tatekakeru" respectively, it's very hard for me to say them consecutively, like "take tatekakeru."<br/><br/>This sentence is very popular as a tongue twister, but I think this is a little unnatural as Japanese.<br/><br/>I guess if I were in this situation, I would say something like:<br/><br/>"Kono takegaki ni take wo tatekaketa riyu ha, tada tan ni sositakatta kara desu."<br/>(The reason why I leaned a bamboo against this bamboo fence is because just I wanted to do so.)

Today, I will talk about an useful Japanese expression "Otsukaresama desu."<br/><br/>Otsukaresama desu is a phrase that rewards someone for his efforts, but we use this in various situations.<br/><br/>First, this phrase can be used when you meet your colleagues or bosses.<br/><br/>Here, it corresponds to "Hi," "Hello," "Good morning," and "Good afternoon" in English.<br/><br/>Second, you can use it when a project or something was settled.<br/><br/>Here, it corresponds to "Good job," "Great work," and "Well done" in English.<br/><br/>Third, you can use it when you go home after your work.<br/><br/>Here, it corresponds to "See you tomorrow," "Good night" and "Have a nice weekend" in English.<br/><br/>Also, if you're close with the conversation partner, you can remove "desu" or "sama desu," and say just "Otsukaresama" or "Otsukare."

Today, I will talk about a Japanese unique expression "adversative passive."<br/><br/>In Japanese, when you suffer inconvenience, you sometimes use intransitive verbs as passive forms.<br/><br/>For example, you can say "I was rained (雨に降られた)" instead of "It rained (雨が降った)."<br/><br/>By using such an expression, you can imply that you suffer inconvenience from the rain.<br/><br/>In addition, you can say something like "犯人に逃げられた, I was fled by the criminal (the criminal fled)," and "夫に死なれた, I was died by my husband (my husband died)."

Today, I will talk about a Japanese sign "odoriji" (the literal meaning is a dancing character).<br/><br/>The "odoriji" is used when the same character is used repeatedly.<br/><br/>There is a typical odoriji "々," and the reading is either the same as the previous character or it with a voiced sound mark.<br/><br/>For example:<br/>時時 → 時々 (the meaning is "sometimes," and the reading is "toki-doki.")<br/>赤裸裸 → 赤裸々 (the meaning is "nudity," and the reading is "seki-rara.")<br/><br/>When you want to type only the odoriji "々," you convert "おどりじ(odoriji)," "おなじ(onaji)," or "くりかえし(kurikaeshi)" into Kanji on your input method editor.<br/><br/>Also, since "々" is able to be seen as a combination of "ノ (no)" and "マ (ma)," it sometimes called "ノマ点 (noma-sign)," and you can convert "のま (noma)" into "々" .

It is said that taking alcohol makes you gain weight, and today I will talk about that.<br/><br/>Alcohol is basically high in calories, and the calories increase as the alcohol degree increases.<br/><br/>According to a professor at the Auckland University of Technology, alcohol has almost the same calories as sugar.<br/><br/>However, calories contained in alcohol is called "empty calories," and they are released from your bodies as heat on a priority basis compared to carbohydrates and lipids.<br/><br/>Therefore, alcohol is less likely to become fat, and it doesn't make you gain weight directly very much.<br/><br/>However, taking alcohol inhibit your fat metabolism rates, and enhance your appetite, so you have to be careful when you drink.

According to a study of University of Westminster, people consume their energies 33% more than usual during watching horror movies.<br/><br/>In fact, the average calorie consumption by watching a 90 minutes horror movie was 133 kilocalories.<br/><br/>The reason for the increment of consumption calories is because rapid-acting adrenaline is secreted by fear, and it increase metabolism.<br/><br/>Also, the more fear the movie is, the more calories you consume.<br/><br/>By the way, "The Shining" showed the highest calorie consumption in this study.<br/><br/>I don't like horror movies very much, but people who love them might enjoy adrenaline secretions.

In Japan, a phrase something like "you should spend three months' salary on an engagement ring" has spread.<br/><br/>I heard that De Beers Group of Companies used this phrase for a promotion of diamond rings in 1970s.<br/><br/>Also, at the same time, the De Beers seemed to use other phrases, "a month's salary for an engagement ring" in the US, and "two months' salary for an engagement ring" in European countries.<br/><br/>The reason of three months' salary in Japan is due to Japanese income levels and yen exchange rates at that time.<br/><br/>I think most Japanese know this phrase, but people who spend actually three months' salary on an engagement ring are about thirty percent.<br/><br/>Considering the average income of the current Japanese, three months' salary will be about 1 million yen (9162 dollars).<br/><br/>Many Japanese seem to think that you should spend your money on what you need in your life, rather than an expensive engagement ring.

I have written about smells until now, but today I will talk about smells of the rain.<br/><br/>It rained yesterday, and there was a rain smell.<br/><br/>As causative substances of rain smells, there are Petrichor and geosmin.<br/><br/>"Petrichor," which means "stone essence" in Greek, is a coined word created by Australian researchers, and expresses a smell that occurs at the beginning of the rain.<br/><br/>The reason of the smell is because some plants' oil is absorbed to the ground, and the rain emit it into the atmosphere.<br/><br/>"Geosmin," which means "smell of the earth" in Greek, expresses a odorous substance that occurs an odor after the rain.<br/><br/>Geosmin is also a causative substance of musty odors from sewers, and it's not a good smell.<br/><br/>I like rain smells in Nagano Prefecture, but don't like rain smells in Tokyo very much.

In Japan, there is a popular kind of melons, called "andes melon."<br/><br/>Actually, I thought of it as melons from the Andes regions, but it was wrong..<br/><br/>In 1977, a Japanese company developed the andes melon by breeding. <br/><br/>At first, it was planned to be sold as "anshin-desu melon (which means something like 'this melon is relieving')."<br/><br/>However, since the naming was bad, it became "andes melon" by removing "shin."<br/><br/>According to the company, the reason why "shin" was removed is because we eat melon after removing the core, which is called "shin" in Japan.

<div class="date" hidden>May 8, 2016 14:05</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
It is said that Japanese like to save money, and the average amount is more than 10 million yen (about 93 thousand dollars).<br/><br/>According to the study of Yale University, the amount of savings might have been dependent on the grammars of the countries' languages.<br/><br/>In English, when you mention about future things, you use future tenses and distinguish it clearly from the present things.<br/><br/>Therefore, you might feel your future is far, and tend to neglect your long-term outlook.<br/><br/>In fact, people who use a language that doesn't have a future tense show higher savings rates than other languages speakers.<br/><br/>Japanese also doesn't have a future tense, and there is no grammatically distinction between future things and present things.<br/><br/>For this reason, we seem to feel that our future is close to the present, and feel anxiety about the future.<br/><br/>Also, there is another opinion that word order saying important things at the end of the sentence affects national identities.

<div class="date" hidden>May 7, 2016 15:03</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the meaning of the Japanese word "jibun."<br/><br/>Normally, "Jibun" means "I," and is used when you refer to yourself.<br/><br/>For example: "Jibun ha Tokyo shusshin desu (I am from Tokyo.)"<br/><br/>However, in Western Japan, "jibun" means "you," and is used when you refer to your conversation partner.<br/><br/>For example: "Jibun doko kara kitann (where are you from)?"<br/><br/>The reason is because they speak while thinking the conversation partner's perspective.<br/><br/>"Boku" is the first-person word for men, but we sometimes use it as the meaning of "you" toward young boys, such as "boku, nan-sai (how old are you)?"<br/><br/>As just described, since first-person and second-person words are sometimes mingle in Japan, please be careful.

Yesterday, May 5th was "tango no sekku," which is the Boys' Festival for expressing the hope that boys will grow up healthy and strong.<br/><br/>"Tan" of "tango" means "beginning," and "go" means "Horse of the Zodiac."<br/><br/>That is, "tango" means "the first Horse Day of the Horse Month."<br/><br/>(Also, "sekku" means "a seasonal festival.")<br/><br/>In Japan, the Oriental Zodiac is assigned to all months and days on the calendar.<br/><br/>Since the Horse Month is May, we had celebrated "tango no sekku" on the first Horse Day of May.<br/><br/>Currently, the day became established as May 5th because the reading of "go" can express "five" in Japan.<br/><br/>This "tango no sekku" is an important day that forms long holidays (Golden Week).

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I stayed in a pension the day before yesterday.<br/><br/>However, the meaning of "pension" is normally "money that is paid regularly as a retirement benefit," so it might be difficult to convey the meaning of the above sentence to English speakers.<br/><br/>"Pension" is the loanword from French.<br/><br/>In European countries, since pensioners have used their vacant rooms as student dormitories or boarding hostels, they refer "relatively inexpensive accommodation" as "pension."<br/><br/>In Japan, we also call "accommodation" "pension," but in general, it is Western-style.<br/><br/>Also, pensions in Japan are located in resort areas or sightseeing spots, and the room rates aren't inexpensive very much.<br/><br/>This seems to correspond to "B&amp;B (bed and breakfast)" in the US and the UK, though we can eat both dinner and breakfast in most cases in Japan.

Yesterday, I received a sad news.<br/><br/>My grandfather (my mother's father) passed away.<br/><br/>Since my grandfather on my mother's side lived in a remote location, I couldn't meet him frequently.<br/><br/>I think that I should have met to him at short intervals.<br/><br/>He was a Christian, and he seem to be in heaven.<br/><br/>I heard that death is the beginning of eternal life, and is not a sad thing for Christians.<br/><br/>However, I think that most people will feel sad more than a little if their familiar person pass away.<br/><br/>I want to pray for his soul to rest in peace

Today, I will to talk about upside down rainbows.<br/><br/>The upside down rainbow is a phenomenon that you can see an upside down rainbow.<br/><br/>Scientifically, it's referred to as a circumzenithal arc.<br/><br/>This rainbow forms an arc centered at the zenith above the sun, and the colors of the sun side is red, and the zenith side is blue.<br/><br/>It occurs when sunlight is refracted by grains of ice.<br/><br/>However, various conditions are needed, such as, the sun altitude is 32 degrees or less, there are hexagonal plate shaped ice crystals in clouds, the ice crystals maintain a horizontal posture, and winds are weak.<br/><br/>It's difficult to meet conditions, but I'd like to watch it someday.

Today, I will talk about a musical instrument, recorder.<br/><br/>The recorder is an wind instrument that generates sounds by resonance of the air.<br/><br/>It is said that this instrument is the origin of all wind instruments, and was originally a tool to teach songs to birds.<br/><br/>Actually, almost all of the Japanese people have a practical experience about recorders.<br/><br/>This is because we use our own recorders at music classes in most Japanese elementary and junior high schools.<br/><br/>There are some reasons to use recorders, such as, it's easy to treat with small hands, easy to carry, durable, and inexpensive.<br/><br/>By the way, I learned how to use xylophones and harps in addition to recorders when I was a junior high school student.<br/><br/>I heard that many other countries don't use instruments in music classes very much, but I'm not sure whether or not it's true.

Today, I tried to assemble a desk, but I missed eight screws.<br/><br/>Therefore, I went to a hardware store to buy screws.<br/><br/>However, I forgot to measure the exact diameter of the missing screws, and I struggled to buy which size.<br/><br/>Sensuously, I thought the size was 4 to 5 mm, and I bought eight screws of M4 and M5, respectively.<br/><br/>Since the hardware store was far from my apartment, I didn't want to go there again.<br/><br/>So just in case, I also bought some other screws that have different length.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the diameter of the screw hole was 6 mm.<br/><br/>Begrudgingly, I went to the hardware store again.<br/><br/>I will measure with a caliper in advance.

After I moved to my new apartment, I came to immerse in a hot bath frequently.<br/><br/>Since I have to use a large amount of water to prepare a bath, I want to soak in the bath for a long time, but it's a little bit boring.<br/><br/>Therefore, I came to bring my iPhone in a ziplock to the bath, and enjoy dramas.<br/><br/>If you close the zipper of the ziplock, it will become waterproof, and you can touch the screen through the ziplock.<br/><br/>However, when you go out of the bath, condensation could occur within the ziplock.<br/><br/>In order to prevent the condensation, it's recommended to suck out the air in the ziplock by using a straw.

Today, I will talk about the game "takenoko nyokki," which had been played in a Japanese TV program.<br/><br/>"Takenoko" means a bamboo shoot, and "nyokki" is an onomatopoeic word that represents a growth.<br/><br/>(Yesterday, I talked about "gnocchi," but its reading in Japan is completely the same as the reading of "nyokki.")<br/><br/>This game is normally played by around six persons, and it begins with a call "takenoko, takenoko, nyokkikki!" while joining their palms.<br/><br/>After that, players declare "1 nyokki!" "2 nyokki!" in order while raising their hands.<br/><br/>The declaration order is not determined, but if more than one person declare the same number, all of them will get defeated.<br/><br/>In addition, the last person who didn't declare will also get defeated.<br/><br/>Although this is a simple game, it's psychological and difficult to win.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "geko."<br/><br/>Originally, this word expressed the lowest rank people in the ancient Japanese political system (Ritsuryosei), which divides social statuses into four ranks.<br/><br/>In wedding ceremonies in those days, the highest rank people (joko) drank 8 sho (14.4 liters) of alcohol, while the lowest rank people (geko) drank 2 sho (3.2 liters) of alcohol.<br/><br/>From this fact, the word "geko" came to mean a person who can't drink alcohol constitutionally.<br/><br/>As you can see from the etymology, this word contains meanings of discriminations and insults.<br/><br/>Therefore, you must be careful to use this word because it may be impolite.<br/><br/>There is no problem in cases that you use the word to refer to yourself.

Some people will sneeze when they see a bright light like sunlight or a fluorescent light.<br/><br/>I think there are also many people who try to sneeze by watching sunlight when they almost sneezed.<br/><br/>This phenomenon is called "photic sneeze reflex."<br/><br/>Because of light stimuli, some people tend to sneeze when they feel bright.<br/><br/>Approximately one in four people have this symptom, and it's believed that trigeminal nerve is greatly related to this.<br/><br/>Also, statistically, it's thought that the photic sneeze reflex is inherited as a dominant trait.<br/><br/>However, the medical evidence hasn't been clear.

Today, I will talk about moles.<br/><br/>Basically, moles dig a tunnel in the soil and live in there.<br/><br/>Since there is almost no sunlight in the soil, moles' eyesight have atrophied, and they can see almost nothing.<br/><br/>Instead, since their senses of smell and hearing have evolved, they can figure objects ' shape out by smells and sounds.<br/><br/>Also, since moles are a big eater, they seem to starve to death if they don't eat anything for twelve hours.<br/><br/>By the way, it's said that the moles' digging speed is similar to the speed of snails.<br/><br/>I feel that their lives are tough.

<div class="date" hidden>Apr 17, 2016 16:57</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are many Japanese phrases that were derived from Katana.<br/><br/>Today, I will talk about two phrases of them.<br/><br/>・Moto no saya ni osamaru (katana is sheathed) ･･･ to get back together.<br/><br/>Once you unsheathe katana, it's difficult to fit other scabbards, but it's easy to fit the original scabbard.<br/><br/>For this reason, the phrase was born.<br/><br/>・Nukiuchi ･･･ to conduct something suddenly without any advance notice.<br/><br/>Originally, nukiuchi meant to unsheathe katana and cut someone simultaneously.<br/><br/>However, this phrase came to be used in various situations.<br/><br/>For example, we refer to a test that is conducted without notice as "nukiuchi test."

<div class="date" hidden>Apr 16, 2016 15:20</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about onions.<br/><br/>Onions is the most sweet vegetable in the world, which includes fructose, glucose and sucrose.<br/><br/>However, since allyl sulfide included in onions is too strong pungent component, you will feel that raw onions are gingery.<br/><br/>Allyl sulfide is highly volatile, and this will be reason to cry when you cut onions.<br/><br/>Also, if you heat allyl sulfide, it will become propyl mercaptan, which has a high sugar content.<br/><br/>Although propyl mercaptan has fewer calories, it's said that the sweetness is 50 times as sweet as sugar.<br/><br/>Onions are an excellent ingredient that is delicious and nutritious if you cook it properly.

Today, I will finish yesterday's entry.<br/><br/>The Japanese national animation "Sazae-san" is broadcasted in the evening every Sunday.<br/><br/>Some Japanese people become depressed after watching Sazae-san, because they have to go to school/work next day.<br/><br/>This symptom is sometimes called "Sazae-san syndrome," which is similar to "Blue Monday Syndrome."<br/><br/>Also, it is said that you can predict changes of Japanese economy by observing the viewer ratings of Sazae-san.<br/><br/>This is because if the economy improve, people will go to eat outside the home on Sunday evenings, and the viewer ratings of Sazae-san will drop.<br/><br/>To tell you the truth, I don't think that this animation is very fun, but you can see it with a light heart.<br/><br/>If you come to Japan, please be sure to watch it.

Today, I will talk about the Japanese national animation "Sazae-san."<br/><br/>Sazae-san has been broadcasted since 1969, and this year is 46th anniversary.<br/><br/>The number of broadcasts and episodes exceed 2350 and 7000, respectively.<br/><br/>Sazae-san entered the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest running animated TV series.<br/><br/>Sazae-san is one of slice-of-life anime, and the characteristic is to do rock-paper-scissors at the end of the broadcast.<br/><br/>Also, any DVDs of Sazae-san haven't been released with the author's wishes.<br/><br/>Therefore, there are many episodes that we can't watch again.<br/><br/>Continue to Part 2.

<div class="date" hidden>Apr 9, 2016 11:26</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I talked about the etymology of "kitsune-no-yomeiri (rain when the sun is shining)."<br/><br/>This phenomenon is officially expressed as "tenki-ame" or "hideri-ame" in Japan ("tenki" and "hideri" mean "sunny," and "ame" means "rain").<br/><br/>Today, I will explain the scientific occurrence reasons of the tenki-ame.<br/><br/>The conditions are able to be divided into two major cases.<br/><br/>One is that rain clouds dissipate before raindrops reach the ground.<br/><br/>If the clouds are convective clouds, since it tends to dissipate after the rainfall, it's easy to become tenki-ame.<br/><br/>Another one is that rains come from a long distance by strong crosswinds.<br/><br/>This phenomenon is often found in mountainous areas.<br/><br/>Also, since sunlight will hit raindrops during the tenki-ame, you will be easier to find rainbows.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I introduced the phrase "kitsune-no-yomeiri (fox's wedding)," which means a rain when the sun is shining.<br/><br/>Today, I will talk about this phrase.<br/><br/>Originally, the "kitsune-no-yomeiri" expresses a weird traditional event in Japan.<br/><br/>In this event, we visit a mountain and make a lantern procession in the night.<br/><br/>Since this scene looks like a Japanese traditional wedding by foxes, we call it "kitsune-no-yomeiri (fox's wedding)."<br/><br/>Also, since a rain when the sun is shining is weird as with the fox's wedding, we call the rain "kitsune-no-yomeiri" too.<br/><br/>I heard that some regions in several countries such as the UK and Brazil also refer the rain as "fox's wedding."<br/><br/>By the way, other countries often refer the rain using other animals.<br/><br/>For example, it's called "monkey's wedding" in Africa, and "mouse's wedding" in Arab countries.

A kiss has various health effects.<br/><br/>According to the German study, husband and wife who kiss each other every morning live an average of 5 years longer than couples who don't.<br/><br/>In addition, couples who kiss every day earn 1.2-1.3 times as much as others.<br/><br/>Also, according to the large-scale survey against 30 countries, Indian married couples seem to kiss most frequently, and the number of kisses is 17.8 times per day.<br/><br/>The second place is Germany, the number is 11.4 times, and the third place is Sweden, the number is 8.8 times.<br/><br/>By the way, the worst country is Japan, and the number is 0.5 times per day.<br/><br/>I'm interested in whether or not life expectancy of Japanese would also increase if we became to kiss frequently.

Today, I learned a correct use of a cane.<br/><br/>I've thought that you should hold a cane with your hand in the same side of your bad foot.<br/><br/>However, this thought is wrong, and the right way is to hold a cane in the opposite side of your bad foot.<br/><br/>Originally, a cane is used to prevent from leaning your entire body weight onto your bad foot.<br/><br/>However, if the distance from your bad foot and a cane is close, the balance will become worse.<br/><br/>Therefore, you should hold a cane with your hand in the opposite side of your bad foot for the sake of a safe.<br/><br/>It is said that you will understand it when you actually use a cane.

Today, I will talk about a "yunomi," which is one of Japanese tableware.<br/><br/>"Yu" in "yunomi" means "hot water," and "nomi" in "yunomi" means "to drink."<br/><br/>As its name suggests, the "yunomi" is a cup bowl to drink hot water or tea.<br/><br/>In most cases, yunomis are made of potteries, and there are no handles that tea cups have.<br/><br/>The reason is to make sure whether or not the temperature of drink is suitable for drinking by your hand.<br/><br/>Since the most delicious temperature of Japanese green tea is about from 60 to 80 Celsius degrees, if you can't hold the yunomi, it expresses that the drink is too hot.<br/><br/>Also, there is another reason that you can enjoy the feel of the pottery by your hand.

Today, I will talk about a Japanese term "ukiashi-datsu."<br/><br/>"Uki" of "ukiashi" means to float, and "ashi" of "ukiashi" means your feet.<br/><br/>Therefore, "ukiashi" means a state that you're standing on your tiptoes and your heels are floating.<br/><br/>Since this state is unstable, "ukiashi" came to express that you're restless and anxious, or you have cold feet.<br/><br/>Nowadays, we often use "ukiashi" as "ukiashi datsu (to stand with a state of ukiashi)," or "ukiashi-ninaru (to become ukiashi)."<br/><br/>Recently, people sometimes use "ukiashi-datsu" as the meaning of "to be restless and excited," but this is misuse.

I prefer Western-style toilets that you can sit on to Japanese-style toilets that you have to bend down, because I can relax by sitting.<br/><br/>However, if you sit on the Western toilets in a normal way, your excrement's flow from your rectum to your anus might be prevented.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is though that a bend down style is suitable for defecation.<br/><br/>In fact, after Western-style toilets became widespread in Japan, the number of constipation patients has been increased.<br/><br/>In order to lay your egg smoothly even when you use Western-style toilets, it is recommended that you prepare a footrest, put your legs on it, and bend forward.

Today, I will write the rest of the yesterday's entry.<br/><br/>In Japan, when we receive a diploma in an award ceremony, we first hold out our left hands.<br/><br/>It is thought that the reason why we think that left is superior to right is because the sun rises from east.<br/><br/>However, since west can become both right and left depending on the observer's direction, I'm not sure whether or not this hypothesis is right.<br/><br/>By the way, many of Australia's indigenous languages don't seem to have words that correspond to "right" and "left."<br/><br/>They use "north," "south," "east" and "west" instead.

Today, I will talk about "right" and "left."<br/><br/>Worldwide, it's thought that "right" is better and more canonical than "left" in many cases.<br/><br/>In fact, "right" has the meaning of something like "correct," and the right-hand side of the first place is the second place in a podium.<br/><br/>On the other hand, "left" has sometimes negative meanings, for example, "left-handed" contains the meaning of "awkward."<br/><br/>In addition, in Hinduism and Islam, a right hand is a sacred hand to eat meals, and a left hand is an impure hand to clean your bottoms.<br/><br/>However, Japanese people often think that "left" is superior to "right."<br/><br/>In our diets, we place staple food and main dish on left-side.<br/><br/>In our politics, the rank of Sadaijin (minister of the left) is higher than the rank of Udaijin (minister of the right).<br/><br/>(Since this post will be too long, I will write the rest part tomorrow.)

Today, I'd like to talk about an exclamation point question mark (!?) and a question mark exclamation mark (?!).<br/><br/>Both symbols are used when you want to express your surprise and question simultaneously, but you can choose either depending on the first emotion that you felt. <br/><br/>In Japanese texts, the exclamation point question mark is used more frequently than the question mark exclamation point.<br/><br/>Also, these symbols are used to represent an ambitious and notable move in a game record of chess.<br/><br/>By the way, I was surprised at the presence of the symbol "interrobang(‽)" today.<br/><br/>This symbol is a fusion of a exclamation point and a question mark, and was invented in 1962 by Martin K. Speckter.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether this symbol is commonly used in overseas.

Today, I will talk about the roots of Japanese curry.<br/><br/>The origin of curry is India, but Japanese-style curry was imported from the British Navy.<br/><br/>In the past, since refrigeration technologies had not been developed, the British Navy couldn't store milk that is an ingredient of a stew.<br/><br/>However, the British Navy learned that spices have an antiseptic effect while stopping over India, and developed British-style curry.<br/><br/>After the British-style curry was imported to Japan, Japanese people added flour and make it thickened to suit rice, which is the Japanese staple.<br/><br/>In this way, Japanese-style curry was made.<br/><br/>By the way, it is famous that people belonging to the Japanese Navy eat curry every Friday in Japan.<br/><br/>This custom was established so as not to forget the sense of days of the week.

March is the season of graduation in Japan.<br/><br/>In Japanese commencement ceremonies, we often sing "hotaru no hikari (glowing firefly)" as a farewell song.<br/><br/>The original song of "hotaru no hikari" is the Scottish folk song "Auld Lang Syne," which is comparable to the Scottish national anthem.<br/><br/>Also, "Auld Lang Syne" has spread all over the world. <br/><br/>Actually, Japanese people sing in favor of songs that were derived from Scottish folk songs in addition to "Auld Lang Syne."<br/><br/>One of the reasons is thought that the musical scale of Scottish folk songs is the same as the Japanese traditional one (5 musical scale).<br/>

Chloroform is a colorless liquid that has a sweet taste and a strong sweet smell.<br/><br/>Once it has been used as a general inhalation anesthetic in surgeries.<br/><br/>Since chloroform has a variety of uses in addition to the anesthetic, many research institutions often use it.<br/><br/>Besides, I think the most popular usage of it is to stun people in dramas or novels.<br/><br/>However, if you inhale some chloroform, you may have nausea and headache, but you won't faint.<br/><br/>If you want to stun someone by using chloroform, you have to: impregnate your handkerchief with a large amount of chloroform, press it against someone's mouth slowly and strongly, and make him/her take a deep breath for about five minutes.<br/><br/>I think that you should choke him/her if you want to stun someone.

Today, I will talk about Japanese verbs "合う (au)" and "会う (au)."<br/><br/>Since each verb has the same reading, and similar kanji, even Japanese people sometimes mistake the usage of them.<br/><br/>However, the meanings are totally different.<br/><br/>"合う" means that something is suitable to something, and "会う" means that a person meets to another person.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>・彼のような大人しい性格の人はこの仕事に合っている。<br/>(Shy people like him is suitable to the job.)<br/><br/>・駅前で兄弟と会う予定だ。<br/>(I'm going to meet to my brother in the station.)<br/><br/>Also, there is another verb "遭う," which can be read as "au."<br/><br/>"遭う" means that a person encounters unlucky events, and the usage is something like the following:<br/><br/>・自転車に乗っていたら事故に遭った。<br/>(I had an accident when I was riding a bicycle.)

Today, I bought the latest model washing machine, and tried to install it in my apartment.<br/><br/>It is a drum-type washing machine, which can perform the laundry process from washing and drying automatically.<br/><br/>Since I wanted to stick to washing machines, I chose a high performance and expensive one among those that have been sold to public.<br/><br/>I couldn't pay for the machine in one payment, so I bought it on an installment plan.<br/><br/>I was so excited.<br/><br/>However, the door width to the washing room was too narrow to carry the washing machine.<br/><br/>I got depressed.<br/><br/>Today, I couldn't install it, but fortunately I found that the door is removable, so I will try to install it again at a later date.

Today, I will introduce Japanese terms "2-maime" and "3-maime."<br/><br/>The literal meanings of "2-maime" and "3-maime" are "a 2nd board" and "a 3rd board," respectively, but the actual meanings are "a handsome man" and "a clown."<br/><br/>The reason is derived from kabuki, which is one of Japanese traditional performing arts.<br/><br/>In a front of kabuki performing theater, there are eight advertising boards, and actor names are written on them.<br/><br/>Traditionally, a leading actor is written in the first board, a handsome man is written in the second board, and a funny man is written in the third board.<br/><br/>Nowadays, only "2-maime" and "3-maime" are usually used in our lives.

One week centering around the spring (autumn) equinox, that is, a period from March 17th to 23rd (from September 19th to 25th) is called "higan."<br/><br/>Japanese people often visit their ancestors' graves among the higan week.<br/><br/>Higan refers to the world where the souls of the dead live in Buddhism.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the world where we live is called "shigan."<br/><br/>Since higan is in the west, and shigan is in the east, we think that higan and shigan are easy to connect in the spring (autumn) equinox that the sun rises directly in the East and sets directly in the West.<br/><br/>However, actually only Japanese Buddhists visit graves in higan.<br/><br/>As one of the reasons, it is said that this tradition is the result of mixing Buddhism with Shinto that worships God of the sun.

There are many loanwords in Japan, and today I will talk about two of them: "アパート (apartment)" and "マンション (mansion)."<br/><br/>The meaning of "アパート" is the same as "apartment," but the meaning of "マンション" is different from "mansion."<br/><br/>In Japan, we call relatively large/luxury apartments "マンション."<br/><br/>Actually, I will live in マンション from next month, but it has only one narrow room.<br/><br/>You will never think of my living space as a mansion.<br/><br/>By the way, since "man" of "mansion" means ten thousand in Japan, we sometimes call really luxury apartments "億ション(oku-sion, 'oku' means '100 million' in Japan).

Gases are used in many Japanese lives.<br/><br/>The gases are divided into two major categories; city gas and propane gas.<br/><br/>The city gas consists primarily of methane, and it is supplied through gas pipes.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the propane gas consists mainly butane or propane, and it is supplied from gas cylinders that are installed outdoors.<br/><br/>The propane gas has some advantages, such as the strength of firepower and the adaptability in times of disaster, but it is very expensive instead.<br/><br/>I think the propane gas costs more than double for the city gas in most cases.<br/><br/>If you are looking for your apartment in Japan, please consider which to choose the city gas or the propane gas.<br/><br/>If the apartment is all-electric type, there is no need to worry about the gas.

Today is White Day that men give women gifts for their Valentine's chocolates in Japan.<br/><br/>However, today is also Pi Day.<br/><br/>In 2009, Pi Day was formally established by the United States House of Representatives.<br/><br/>In mathematics departments of some universities, anniversary parties seem to be held in this day.<br/><br/>Also, right now, I am submitting this post on March 14, 15:09.<br/><br/>I chose the time closer to pi among Pi Day.<br/><br/>By the way, there is an ultimate pi day (time), which is 3/14/1952 6:53:58.

<div class="date" hidden>Mar 13, 2016 17:02</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "tarai mawashi."<br/><br/>The phrase "tarai mawashi" expresses an acrobatic barrel-rolling performance using your feet, but this has been converted to mean that things are shifted from one section to another repeatedly.<br/><br/>For example, it's a situation such as: when you went to hospital A, you were said "please go to hospital B," then you went to hospital B, but you were said "please go to hospital C," so you went to hospital C, but you were said "please go to hospital A."<br/><br/>If you want to experience such "tarai mawashi," please visit an Uncyclopedia page about "tarai mawashi" shown in the following URL.<br/><br/><a href="http://ja.uncyclopedia.info/wiki/" target="_blank">http://ja.uncyclopedia.info/wiki/</a>%E7%9B%A5%E5%9B%9E%E3%81%97<br/><br/>You will be prompted to refer to different pages one after another.<br/><br/>This is really "tarai mawashi."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Japan, standing chabashira is thought of as an auspicious sign.<br/><br/>(Chabashira means stem portions of tea leaves.)<br/><br/>One of the reasons is because it's very rare that chabashira stands on tea.<br/><br/>First of all, stems of tea leaves seldom pass through a tea strainer.<br/><br/>Then, when one side of the stem absorb water, you can see it stands on the tea surface for only a short period.<br/><br/>Timing is important.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, since recent tea strainers are very finely, it became really difficult to find the standing chabashira.

Shapes of eggs differ depending on the organisms.<br/><br/>For example, many kinds of fish lay spherical eggs.<br/><br/>On the other hand, reptiles and birds lay elliptical eggs.<br/><br/>It is said that one of the reasons is to make easier to lay eggs that are large compared to their bodies.<br/><br/>In addition, birds' eggs have characteristic elliptical shapes, one side is thin, and the other hand is thick.<br/><br/>It is thought that the reason is to prevent eggs from rolling farther and farther away from their nests.<br/><br/>In fact, since owls that make their nests in holes of trees don't worry about rolling eggs, the shapes close to a sphere.

Today, I will talk about the difference between "shovel" and "scoop."<br/><br/>According to the JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards), it is defined that the shovel has a portion that you can put your foot, and the scoop doesn't have it.<br/><br/>However, most Japanese people distinguish them in their sizes.<br/><br/>In western Japan, people call big ones "shovel," and small ones "scoop."<br/><br/>On the other hand, in eastern Japan, people call small ones "shovel," and big ones "scoop."<br/><br/>I'm not sure the reason.<br/><br/>Anyway it's confusing, so you have to be careful.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are some special age in Japan, and we celebrate the birthday of the year in different ways from usual.<br/><br/>First, when you reach the age of 60, it's called "kan-reki," where "kan" means "return," and "reki" means "almanac."<br/><br/>Since the Oriental zodiac is composed of 60 kinds and it repeats itself every 60 years, we think the 61st birthday is special.<br/><br/>In the celebration of the kan-reki, we present a red chanchanko (red padded sleeveless kimono jacket, red Japanese vest) that have the meaning of an amulet, and the kan-reki person wear it.<br/><br/>Also, to reach the age of 88 is called "bei-ju," where "bei" means "rice," and "ju" means "almanac."<br/><br/>The reason is because the kanji "八十八 (which means 88)" looks like the transformation of the kanji "米 (which means rice), and we present a yellow chanchanko wishing for good health.<br/><br/>To be the age of 99 is called "haku-ju," where "haku" means "white."<br/><br/>The reason is because the kanji "百 (which means one hundred)" becomes "白 (which means white)" when you subtract "一 (which means one)" from "百," and we present a whilte chanchanko.<br/><br/>My father will reach the kan-reki this year, so my brother, my sister and I have to prepare the celebration.

In recent years, doing desk work while standing up has got a lot of attention.<br/><br/>By standing up constantly, you can improve your posture and blood circulation of your feet.<br/><br/>Also, you can continue to concentrate, and won't become sleepy.<br/><br/>Of course it will make you tired, but you also will divide your break from your work sharply.<br/><br/>On the other hand, people who sit for a long time every day seem to have back pain and stiff shoulder, because of decline of muscle for supporting your hip.<br/><br/>Furthermore, they have higher risks about heart disease due to poor circulation and diabetes due to insulin decrease.<br/><br/>I might consider a purchase of a standing desk for my new workplace.

Today, I will talk about "nikujaga," which is a familiar simmered dish in Japan.<br/><br/>The ingredients of the nikujaga is meat, potatoes, onions and konjac, and the cooking procedure is divided into two steps: fry the ingredients, and simmer them with soy sauce, sugar, and mirin (which is an alcoholic condiment).<br/><br/>It is easy to cook the nikujaga, so we often refer it as "a taste of mother's home cooking."<br/><br/>However, it is said that we actually made the nikujaga by imitating a beef stew.<br/><br/>In 1870s, a Japanese, Heihachiro Togo was studying in the UK, and he liked the beef stew, then he tried to make someone to cook it in Japan.<br/><br/>However, there were no wine and a demi-glace sauce in Japan.<br/><br/>For the reason, we tried to cook the beef stew using soy sauce and sugar, as a result, the nikujaga seemed to be made.

Today, March 4th, is Baumkuchen day.<br/><br/>This is derived from the fact that Baumkuchen have been manufactured and sold since March 4th, 1919.<br/><br/>Today is also the sewing machine ( which is called "mishin" in Japan) day, because "mi" means "three," and "shi" means "four."<br/><br/>Furthermore, today is a sash(sasshi) day, a magazine(zasshi) day, and a three sisters(san-shimai) day("sa" and "za" means "three," "shi" means "four" in Japan).<br/><br/>However, most Japanese people don't think that March 4th is a special day.<br/><br/>I think that one of the reasons is because March 3rd is a special day as Dolls' Festival for Japanese.<br/><br/>Japanese set up a lot of dolls, and  wish girls both health and growth on March 3rd.

<div class="date" hidden>Mar 2, 2016 19:38</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the difference between the Japanese phrases "iro-iro" and "sama-zama."<br/><br/>Both of them have almost the same meaning like "various," and you can replace them in most cases.<br/><br/>"Iro" of "iro-iro" means "color," and "iro-iro" had used for flowers or fabrics as the meaning of "colorful."<br/><br/>However, currently it came to have the meaning of "various."<br/><br/>On the other hand, "sama" of "sama-zama" means something like "state," and "sama-zama" is a more formal expression than "iro-iro."<br/><br/>Also, you can write both of them in Kanji, but to use Hiragana is recommended due to readability.

Today, February 29th is a leap year.<br/><br/>I can write this sentence only once every four years.<br/><br/>I'll do my best so that I write "today is a leap year" on Lang-8 again.<br/><br/>The leap year has been established to correct deviations of the calendar, because one year is not 365 days, but about 365.2422 days.<br/><br/>In addition, in the Gregorian calendar, there are two other rules to correct subtle deviations due to leap years; if the year is divided by 100 then it's regarded as a common year, but if the year is divided by 400 then it's regarded as a leap year.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in the modified Julian calendar, if the year is divided by 100 then it's regarded as a common year, but if the remainder of the year when divided by 900 is 200 or 600 then the year is regarded as a leap year.<br/><br/>Both of them are very accurate calculation methods of the calendar, but the modified Julian calendar is more accurate.

Today, I will tell you about the Japanese word "shikato(シカト)," which means "disregard."<br/><br/>Since "shikato" is mainly used by young people, it is often thought of as a youth slang expression, but it exists from of old.<br/><br/>This word is derived from a picture of hanafuda that is Japanese playing cards.<br/><br/>In the hanafuda, there are four cards for each month that seasonal flowers are drawn.<br/><br/>In these cards, although autumn leaves and a deer ("shika" in Japanese) are drawn in October of a 10 points card ("10" is called "ju" or "to" in Japan), the deer doesn't see the autumn leaves and looks away.<br/><br/>From the looks of it, the word "shikato," which means "disregard" was made.

Today, I will talk about a weird scholarship system in Japan.<br/><br/>Japanese scholarships are divided into three major categories, "benefit scholarship," "interest-free loan type scholarship," and "interest-bearing loan type scholarship."<br/><br/>Currently, about 60% of Japanese college/university students are using these scholarship systems.<br/><br/>However, the allocation of the benefit scholarship is very small, so almost all students have to borrow scholarship loans.<br/><br/>Furthermore, about 85% of them seem to borrow "interest-bearing loan type scholarships."<br/><br/>We call all these systems "scholarships(奨学金)," but I think that the loan type scholarships are just "student loans."<br/><br/>It can be called "debts."<br/><br/>It's not rare that Japanese people who went on to doctoral courses have debts of 10 million yen (90,000 dollars) when they graduate.<br/><br/>In fact, I heard many people are suffering from the repayments of the scholarships.<br/><br/>I think we should allocate more national budget to education fields.

Seawater contains salts, and about one-third of produced salts in the world is made from seawater.<br/><br/>According to the Japanese old tale, since a millstone that continues to produce salts sunk into the sea, the sea water became salty.<br/><br/>However, the true reason is because the seawater was strongly acidic in the ancient times.<br/><br/>The acidic seawater and the acid rain melted rock strata, and mineral seeped into the sea, then the seawater became salt water.<br/><br/>Currently the feed rate of salts is almost commensurate with the removal rate of salts, so the saltiness of the seawater is constant.

The word "unique" is one of foreign words that are often used in Japan.<br/><br/>It is said that "unique" was derived from "unus," which means "one" in Latin, and it has several meanings such as "individual" or "sole."<br/><br/>However, somehow many Japanese misunderstand the meaning of "unique."<br/><br/>If we say "he is a unique person (彼はユニークな人だ)," the meaning will become something like "he is a funny person (彼は面白い人だ)."<br/><br/>In my opinion, Japanese confuse the meanings of "unique（ユニーク）" with "humor（ユーモア）."

Dogs and cats are very popular as pets.<br/><br/>I heard the number of dogs and cats kept as pets are almost the same.<br/><br/>However, according to a questionnaire survey, the ratio of dog persons is around 60%, while cat persons is around 40%.<br/><br/>Also, there seems to be some good trend in dog persons.<br/><br/>For example, the questionnaire result showed that dog persons have more friends on SNSs, and are more liked by various people.<br/><br/>Especially for men, an average annual income of dog persons was about 10,000 dollars higher than cat persons.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the number of cat videos is overwhelmingly larger than dog videos.<br/><br/>I like both dogs and cats.

Today, February 23 is the Fujisan Day.<br/><br/>The reason is because we can read "2" as "fu(tatsu)" and "ji," and "3" as "san."<br/><br/>This day was established by Shizuoka Prefecture and Yamanashi Prefecture, where the Mount Fuji is located.<br/><br/>In many public schools in Shizuoka Prefecture, today seems to be a holiday.<br/><br/>Also, there are a lot of events related to Mount Fuji in various places.<br/><br/>It sounds fun, but there is almost no event in other prefecture.<br/><br/>Actually, I just found out the day today.

Today, I will write about a Japanese proverb "a tanuki's sleep (tanuki neiri)."<br/><br/>"A tanuki's sleep" is to pretend to be asleep when you feel bad. <br/><br/>The tanuki (raccoon dog) is a very timid animal, and pretends to be asleep (or loses consciousness) when it senses danger.<br/><br/>Since the figure looks like a pretended sleep that  deceives humans, we made the proverb "a tanuki's sleep."<br/><br/>For the same reason, there is an expression "play possum" that means "a pretended sleep" in English.<br/><br/>Also, there is another expression "a fox's sleep."<br/><br/>The reason is because foxes are sly and it's thought that they deceive humans.<br/><br/>By the way, I heard that there are little expressions like them except English and Japanese.

In Japan, there is a popular belief that Kaminari-sama (Mr. Thunder) falls from the sky and picks your belly button.<br/><br/>Therefore, we are taught to hide our belly buttons when we hear a peal of thunder.<br/><br/>It might sound strange, but there are rational reasons.<br/><br/>When a thunderstorm comes, especially it is due to a cold front, it causes an extreme drop in temperature.<br/><br/>For this reason, you have to cover your belly button so as not to cool your stomach.<br/><br/>It is said that this belief was created to prevent children from catching a cold.<br/><br/>Also, there is also another reason to avoid lightning strike by hiding your belly button and lowering your head position.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to tell you about mysterious biology of pandas, especially giant pandas.<br/><br/>It is said that the name "panda" is derived from "bamboo" in Nepali, and as the name indicates, pandas eat mainly bamboos.<br/><br/>However, pandas' digestive organs are ones of carnivorous animals such as bears, so the bamboos are not digested enough.<br/><br/>In addition, since bamboos have less nutritional values, pandas have to eat massive amounts of bamboos to supply energies.<br/><br/>Also, to excrete when the digestion is insufficient is associated with sharp pain, so pandas seem to become limp after the excretion.<br/><br/>For these reasons, pandas spend 55% of the day on their diets, and 40% of the day sleeping.<br/><br/>Although this might sound really bad efficiency, there is an advantage.<br/><br/>Bamboos never wither even if ice age comes again, so pandas can survive while the ice age.<br/><br/>By the way, it's not really know the reason why pandas have white and black pattern hairs, unlike in the case of zebras.

Mount Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan, and most Japanese people love this mountain.<br/><br/>Today, I will introduce information about the height of the Mount Fuji.<br/><br/>In 1885, the height of the Mount Fuji was 3778 meters.<br/><br/>However, the Great Kanto Earthquake struck in 1923.<br/><br/>As a result of the re-measurement three years later, the height became 3776 meters.<br/><br/>After that, we seemed to reinforce the summit part of the Mount Fuji with concrete, so as not to decrease the height any more.<br/><br/>For this reason, currently the height is still 3776 meters.

<div class="date" hidden>Feb 16, 2016 14:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Most Japanese companies pay bonuses to workers twice a year, apart from regular salaries.<br/><br/>The average amount of the bonus in Japan is about 1 million yen (8,720 dollars) a year, but it could fluctuate greatly depending on the company.<br/><br/>The bonuses are over 3.5 million yen (30,520 dollars) in leading companies, while they are 0 yen in small enterprises.<br/><br/>As a result of searching about the bonuses in overseas, I found that many countries seem to pay bonuses once a year.<br/><br/>In some countries, companies pay 13 months' salaries, and this extra part seems to correspond to bonuses.<br/><br/>By the way, some Japanese companies pay "mochi payments (rice-cake payments)," in addition to bonuses at the end of the year.<br/><br/>The reason why we call it "mochi payments" is that we often eat mochi during the New Year holidays, but it is just something like "otoshidama(New Year's gift money)."<br/><br/>Although mochi payments are around tens of thousands yen (300-500 dollars) in many cases, the Liberal Democratic Party seems to pay 1 million yen to each assembly member as mochi payments.

Today, I went to a dental clinic, and got my two wisdom teeth out.<br/><br/>The number of extracted wisdom teeth became four, so now there is no wisdom tooth in my mouth.<br/><br/>Since anesthesia is working, I don't feel any pain now, however after a while, the anesthetic will wear off and I will come to feel some pain.<br/><br/>(When I was writing this post, I came to ache, haha.)<br/><br/>I'm scared because it was very painful when I had my wisdom teeth pulled out two years ago.<br/><br/>Anyway, I never want to go dental clinics.

I sometimes find an opinion that Japanese work too long on the Internet.<br/><br/>Previously in Japan, since there were some famous phrases, such as "Monday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Friday" and "can you fight for 24 hours?," I had an impression that we work long time.<br/><br/>However, it was also said that Japanese don't work hard, they just work long time.<br/><br/>In order to solve this problem, recently Japan introduced a 5-day work week system, and increased the number of national holidays.<br/><br/>The current number of national holidays in Japan is 16 days, and the number is the third largest in the world.<br/><br/>However, I think two problems remain, working overtime for no pay and vacation deprivations.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, many Japanese companies don't seem to meet the Labor Standards Act.

There are about 55 thousands convenience stores in Japan.<br/><br/>This means that there is a convenience store for every 2,300 people.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are about 77 thousands temples and about 81 thousands shrines in Japan.<br/><br/>I thought there are a lot of convenience stores in many places, but I was surprised that there are more temples and shrines.<br/><br/>Somehow there has been an increase in the number of temples and shrines.<br/><br/>When you go to Japan for sightseeing, I recommend you to visit traditional and historic temples and shrines.<br/><br/>By the way, there are about 69 thousands dental clinics in Japan.<br/><br/>The number is also more than the number of convenience stores.

(I'm sorry, today's topic is a little bit ribald.)<br/><br/>Today, I learned that colors that represent obscene things differ among countries.<br/><br/>Here in Japan, obscene movies for adults are called "pink movies."<br/><br/>It is said that the reason is because pink represents human's skin.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it seems to be called "blue films" in English.<br/><br/>As one of the reasons, there is a fact that obscene films had been colored using blue.<br/><br/>Also, the color seems to be yellow in China, green in Spain, and red in Italy.

Recently, I often correct graduation theses of students in my laboratory.<br/><br/>Since they are Japanese sentences that were written by Japanese, surely there are not many grammatical errors.<br/><br/>However, there are some basic errors related to tenses and conjunctions.<br/><br/>When I notice such a little mistakes, I recall my experience of Lang-8.<br/><br/>I think I've been more sensitive to a little mistake because I've continued to correct Japanese sentences on Lang-8.<br/><br/>I am grateful to everyone.

According to the international standards, a stop sign has an octagon shape, but it has an inverted triangle shape in Japan.<br/><br/>Originally, Japan had used an octagon shape for the stop sign following the US, but in 1963, we changed it into an inverted triangle that had been used in Germany, because the shape had a high visibility.<br/><br/>However, in 1968, since an octagon shape was decided as the international standards, Germany changed stop signs into octagon shapes.<br/><br/>Finally, only Japan has been left behind.<br/><br/>Also, recently the Japanese government seems to consider changing the stop sign into the octagon shape in concert with the Tokyo Olympic in 2020.<br/><br/>Since the number of stop signs on Japanese roads is about 1.7 billion, it will cost 22.5 billion yen (192 million dollars) to replace all of them.<br/><br/>※Sorry, the number 22.5 billion was wrong, and the correct number is 25.5 billion (217 million dollars).

Today, I will talk about "thank you hazard," which is often used on Japanese roads.<br/><br/>The "thank you hazard" is to turn on the hazard lights for a short time to convey a feeling of "thank you" when drivers make way for other drivers.<br/><br/>If it is still light and the drivers can see the faces each other, they also raise the hand, or bow the head to convey thankfulness.<br/><br/>However, after it gets dark, the "thank you hazard" is mainly used.<br/><br/>When I see the "thank you hazard," I become a little happy.<br/><br/>Some people sound the horn to convey thankfulness, but this is actually illegal, and I want them to stop because it could stun me.<br/><br/>By the way, it is said that this custom was born in Germany by track drivers, and it was introduced into Japan, then became widely used.

A few days ago, computers of my colleagues came to act up.<br/><br/>Since the cause seemed to be the motherboard, it was difficult to repair it.<br/><br/>So today, I purchased some computer components, and built new ones for them.<br/><br/>I challenged to use the Mini-ITX standard for the first time, but I had trouble wiring the cords because of the smallness.<br/><br/>Finally, somehow I could complete them, and they worked.<br/><br/>I'm tired, but it was fun.

Today, I searched for Sakha Republic, which is one of 85 federal subjects of the Russian Federation.<br/><br/>Since Sakha Republic has recorded minus 71.2 Celsius degrees, which is the world's lowest temperature except for Antarctica, it is thought of as the cold pole in the Northern Hemisphere.<br/><br/>Also, when the temperature goes below minus 50 degrees, schools seem to be closed.<br/><br/>I think there are little people who are sick, because disease-causing bacteria can't inhabit such cold regions.<br/><br/>However, the temperature seems to goes up to almost 30 degrees in summer.<br/><br/>By the way, Sakha Republic is famous for diamonds, and one fourth of diamonds in the worlds is mined in Sakha.<br/><br/>The number of countries where I want to go increased today.

Thoughts and preferences seem to be different between countries.<br/><br/>Japanese tend to prefer a refreshing white light rather than a warm bulb light.<br/><br/>In fact, fluorescent lamps are equipped in almost all Japanese households.<br/><br/>Therefore, rooms in Japan are very bright even at night.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in Europe and the US, only required places are illuminated by incandescent light bulbs, and fluorescent lamps are not used so much.<br/><br/>If you use only the required brightness in the required places, you can save on electricity, and it will not disturb our your living rhythm.<br/><br/>For these reasons, recently in Japan, the modality of the illumination has been reconsidered.

<div class="date" hidden>Feb 3, 2016 10:24</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will introduce how to get on and off trains in Japan.<br/><br/>There are many types of trains, but the ways to get on and off them are divided into three types.<br/><br/>In cities like Tokyo or many other regions, doors of trains open and close automatically. <br/><br/>However, in the suburbs or the countryside (especially in cold regions), we have to open and close the doors by pushing buttons.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if the trains are old types, we have to open and close the doors by using our hands.<br/><br/>The reason why the opening and closing are performed manually is to improve the efficiency of heating and cooling by not leaving the doors open.<br/><br/>Also, the last person who was getting on or off the train has not to forget to close the door firmly.<br/><br/>Please be careful when you use these trains in Japan.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned that living beings that can take breaths through the mouth is only human beings.<br/><br/>First, insects basically take breaths through their abdominal holes called spiracle.<br/><br/>Birds and reptiles take breathes through their noses, because their noses and mouths are directly connected with their respiratory tracts and esophagus, respectively.<br/><br/>Mammals that walk on four legs such as dogs and cats cannot inhale air, because their palates overlap with their epiglottises.<br/><br/>Living beings except human beings have basically separate respiratory tracts and esophagus.<br/><br/>It's also true even for anthropoid apes.<br/><br/>Only human beings share their respiratory tracts and esophagus.<br/><br/>The reason is thought that we have come to walk upright, or come to speak languages.<br/><br/>However, the mouth breathing has many disadvantages, so you don't have to do it too much.

Since getting cold, many people might feel that it's hard to get up in the morning.<br/><br/>Today, I found a "habit of exposure to the morning sun," that is recommended for such people.<br/><br/>Usually, there is a gap between the living cycle and the body clock.<br/><br/>However, by being exposed to the morning sun, the body clock is reset and the gap is able to be modified.<br/><br/>The ideal time to be exposed to the light is about 20-30 minutes within two hours after waking up.<br/><br/>When you wake up, if you go to near the windows, open the curtain, and stay there for a while, you can spend the whole day cheerfully.<br/><br/>Actually, it's enough as long as the illumination intensity is more than 2000 lux, but general indoor lighting is around 1000 lux (general convenience store lighting is around 2500 lux).<br/><br/>On the other hand, the illumination intensity is around 50,000 lux in the sunny day, around 10,000 lux in the cloudy day, and around 5,000 lux in the rainy day.<br/><br/>It's the most efficient to be exposed to the sunlight.

<div class="date" hidden>Jan 28, 2016 13:01</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
When I correct Japanese sentences on Lang-8, I sometimes see expressions such as "今理解できます" and "今わかります."<br/><br/>I think these are the literal translation results of "now I understand," but they're a little unnatural.<br/><br/>Today, I'd like to show you how to express "now I understand" in Japanese.<br/><br/>First, since we often express "a moment of understanding" when we understand something, past tenses are usually used in such situations.<br/><br/>I mean, "今理解できます" and "今わかります" become "今理解できました" and "今わかりました," respectively.<br/><br/>At least these are natural Japanese sentences, but the word "今(now)" is not excellent with past tenses very much, because "今" implies "in this precise moment."<br/><br/>In my opinion, they will become more natural by changing as the following sentences without using "今" ;<br/><br/>・やっとわかりました（やっと理解できました）。<br/>・ようやく納得できました。<br/>・なるほど、そういうことですか。

Yesterday, I went home and was going to go to the toilet, but the water in the toilet had frozen.<br/><br/>Unless something is done, the water won't flow.<br/><br/>However, I noticed that the frozen area was only near the surface.<br/><br/>Therefore, I tried to pour boiled water into the frozen area several times, and after a while, finally the frozen water melted and flowed.<br/><br/>Somehow it worked.<br/><br/>If it was water-pipes in the kitchen or the bathroom, we could prevent them from freezing by continue to run slight water constantly, but it not valid for the toilet.<br/><br/>I have to consider solutions.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Few days ago, it was a hot topic that Japanese television stations put up the phrase "頑張れ (go for it)" as a candidate of banned words.<br/><br/>Apparently, someone seems to have made a complaint such as that the phrase gives us the pressure.<br/><br/>However, I can't understand the reason well.<br/><br/>"頑張れ" is a generic phrase that is used when you cheer someone, and I have used it well.<br/><br/>I heard a complaint like "I feel annoyed when someone said '頑張れ' to me, because I'm already working hard," but if I'm in the situation, I will be so impressed when I heard someone say that.<br/><br/>There seem to be a gap in how to feel for the phrase even among Japanese.<br/><br/>This may be because the phrase have several meanings, such as "hang in there," "do your best," "good luck," and "you can do it."<br/><br/>We need to pay attention.

Under the influence of the cold wave, it seems to snow heavily and very cold in the northern hemisphere.<br/><br/>The region where I live is also cold especially today: the highest temperature is 1 Celsius degree, and the lowest temperature is -11 Celsius degrees.<br/><br/>However, fortunately, there are little snow in this region.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in western Japan, since the temperature usually doesn't become too cold, troubles of water pipes freezing and rupturing seem to be occurred in a row.<br/><br/>I found a person who dived into snows in the nude on Twitter.<br/><br/>He tried to take a shower with warm water, but he couldn't because the water pipe froze.<br/><br/>Please be careful.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Sleep is very valuable for human beings.<br/><br/>It can heal fatigues of your body and brain, enhance immunity, and get rid of stresses.<br/><br/>However, if the quality of sleep is low or the sleep is not enough, it will cause obesity, aging, weakening of the immune system and increasing of the cancer risk.<br/><br/>For a high-quality sleep, the secretion of melatonin, which you might call "sleep hormone," is required.<br/><br/>We usually start to secrete melatonin before sleep, and a large amount of melatonin is secreted during the sleep.<br/><br/>Melatonin is secreted from your pineal gland, but even if slight light enter your eyes, the secretion will be suppressed.<br/><br/>You should not use a PC or a smartphone before bedtime, and you should make your room totally dark while sleeping.

Today, I learned about colors that symbolize "death" for each country.<br/><br/>In many countries, such as the US, Europe, China, and Japan, people think the symbol color of death is "black."<br/><br/>The reason seems to be derived from that black is associated with darkness and people wear black costumes in funerals.<br/><br/>However, it is "green" in South America.<br/><br/>The reason seems to be due to the thought that the dead are equal to nature.<br/><br/>By the way, the symbol color of death is "white" for Hindus, and "silver" for Muslims.

Automatic doors sometimes don't react to me.<br/><br/>It's a little embarrassing.<br/><br/>Formerly there were automatic doors that detect  weights, but recently almost all of them use infrared sensors.<br/><br/>Therefore, the reason why automatic doors don't react is due to your clothes or your hair colors.<br/><br/>Basically, when the color is dark or the similar to the floor/mat color, it's difficult to react.<br/><br/>Conversely, when your clothes/hair color is bright or gaudy, it's easy to react.<br/><br/>If the automatic door doesn't react to you, let's move strongly with a bright thing.

Today, I'd like to introduce a Japanese phrase that we often confused.<br/><br/>It's "ue niwa ue ga aru (which means there's no limit to things, or there's always somebody above you.)"<br/><br/>This is the phrase, which express there is no limit to things, but we often say "ue niwa ue ga iru ("iru" means a person is present, while "aru" means a thing is present)."<br/><br/>I think the reason is because when we say this phrase to people, "iru" sounds more natural.<br/><br/>However, originally, using "aru" in this phrase seems to be accurate even when the subject is person.<br/><br/>Actually, I had also thought that "ue niwa ue ga iru" was a correct Japanese expression until today.

Today the snow piled up high after a long interval.<br/><br/>It was scared for me to drive a snowy road as ever.<br/><br/>However, since I felt that it was warmer than usual, I searched for the reason.<br/><br/>When the snow falls, the height of cloud become low, and radiative cooling is suppressed.<br/><br/>Also, when the snow is piled up, the effect of solar radiation reflected from snow surfaces becomes large, and it could make us feel warm.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if a condition that wind is calm is added, we seem to feel the snow day as a warm day.

According to the research of Northampton University, cows have best friends of the same sex.<br/><br/>When separating a particular partner from the cows, their heart rates and cortisol blood levels increase.<br/><br/>This means that they feel a strong stress.<br/><br/>This research also implies that cows have high sociality.<br/><br/>Researchers point out to be able to increase the productivity of cows by letting them see their best friends always.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Obese people are sometimes referred as "豚(buta, which means pig)" in Japan.<br/><br/>(I have no idea whether such a figurative expression is used as well overseas.)<br/><br/>However, the body fat percentage of the pig is actually about 13% to 18%.<br/><br/>That is, it is lower than the body fat percentage of the average human.<br/><br/>Also, some people seem to use "豚(pig)" as the meaning of "dirty" or "idiot."<br/><br/>However, pigs are a cleanly animal, because they distinguish clearly a toilet, a bedding, and a place to eat.<br/><br/>Furthermore, since they can recognize themselves when they watch a mirror, it's able to be said that they have high cognitive abilities.<br/><br/>The expression "pig" might be a compliment.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to introduce a custom of Japanese schools.<br/><br/>Japanese schools (except university/college) usually don't hire a cleaning staff,  students clean their classrooms and equipment.<br/><br/>In most cases, all students are separated into several groups, and each group cleans a classroom, a hallway, a toilet, or a schoolyard, respectively, everyday.<br/><br/>If you search for "Japan school cleaning" on Google Images, you will find the scenes (which are so nostalgic for me...).<br/><br/>For these reasons, I think we would become to use public facilities carefully so as not to blemish them.<br/><br/>By the way, in most Japanese elementary/junior high/high schools, we change into indoor shoes when we enter the school buildings.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
If your feet bottom or armpit is touched by somebody else, you will feel a tickle and laugh.<br/><br/>Why is that?<br/><br/>Since regions that artery passes close to your skin are danger, a lot of nerve is concentrated so as to be acutely aware of stimulation.<br/><br/>However, even if you touch such regions by yourself, you will not feel a tickle because your cerebellum will predict the stimulus and control it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if somebody else touches you, your brain will fall into chaos and generate an unpleasant sensation, because your cerebellum can't predict the stimulus.<br/><br/>This sensation is called tickling sensation, it make us laugh to relieve/escape the status.<br/><br/>There is experimental data that monkeys and rats also laugh when they are tickled.<br/><br/>By the way, tickling had been performed as a kind of torture at a time in the past.

According to a study that summarizes 188 countries data, one third of the world's population seem to be obese.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are no countries that succeeded in reducing obesity population in the past 33 years.<br/><br/>WHO has defined people with more than 30 BMI as obesity, and in the criteria, about 5% Japanese are obesity.<br/><br/>However, most Japanese develop diabetes before their BMI reach 30, so we can't gain weight in healthy.<br/><br/>For the reason, the Japan Society for the Study of Obesity has defined Japanese people with more than 25 BMI as obesity.<br/><br/>The obesity rate in Japan also tends to increase, but the BMI average value of 10-20's women was decreased.<br/><br/>Most Japanese women desire to lose their weight, and it's said that around one in eight is too skinny.<br/><br/>In particular, the average calorie intake of 20's Japanese women is 1628 kcal, which is lower than the food shortage days immediately after the end of the war, and the number seems exceptionally low level in the world.

Today, I will share some trivia about polar bears.<br/><br/>The polar bear looks white, but the skin color is actually black, and the hair color is transparent.<br/><br/>If the body hair color is transparent, the heat of the sun will be absorbed effectively because light is transmitted easily through the hair.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the inside of the hair is hollow, and light is scattered, so it looks white, and it has an heat accumulation effect.<br/><br/>Since the body temperature of the polar bear is hardly released, there are very little infrared light that is radiated from the body, and it's really difficult to capture the figure using an infrared camera.<br/><br/>Also, the body hair, which looks white, plays a role of protective coloration, and polar bears seem to hide their black noses when they have a hunt.

Yesterday, I told you about national gemstones, but today I will introduce a national fungus.<br/><br/>The national fungus symbolize the country, and only Japan defined it as far as I know.<br/><br/>The national fungus in Japan is Aspergillus oryzae, which is indispensable for the Japanese food culture.<br/><br/>The Aspergillus oryzae can make various enzymes by decomposing grain components.<br/><br/>By using this property, we have produced ingredients such as soy sauce, miso, and sake, that are used for Japanese foods.<br/><br/>This fungus indeed represent Japan.

Many people may be familiar with national flowers (also known as floral emblems) and national birds, but today I will show you national gemstones.<br/><br/>National gemstones are stones that symbolizes the countries, and a national gemstone in Japan is a crystal.<br/><br/>The reason is because that once high-quality crystals were able to be extracted in Japan, and we had an excellent crystal polishing technique.<br/><br/>Basically, stones that are known as specialties become the national gemstones.<br/><br/>For example, the national gemstone in; India and Arab is a pearl, Austria and Australia is an opal, Thailand and Myanmar is a ruby, and Colombia is an emerald.<br/><br/>There are also many exceptions, e.g., the national gemstone in; the US is a sapphire, the UK is a diamond, and China is a jade, but the localities of these gemstones are not these countries.<br/><br/>These national gemstones were decided by the national flag color, the national image, or the trade culture.

We often see snails on concrete walls after the rain.<br/><br/>Do you know the reason?<br/><br/>Since snails' shells are mainly made of calcium carbonate, they are able to extend their shells by incorporating calcium.<br/><br/>Also, when concrete gets wet, calcium carbonate ooze out.<br/><br/>Yes, they come on concrete walls to eat calcium carbonate that oozes out of concrete.<br/><br/>By the way, snails have about 12 thousand teeth, and don't have genders.

When you sneeze, you will close your eyes naturally.<br/><br/>This is because to prevent your eyes from popping out (eyeball dislocation).<br/><br/>If you close your eyes strongly, your cheek muscles will rise, and your nasal cavity will expand.<br/><br/>As the result, the breathability of your nose will become smooth, and the pressure on your eyeballs will become suppressed.<br/><br/>Therefore, if you sneeze without closing your eyes, your eyeballs may pop out literally.

First Dream of the Year is called Hatsuyume in Japan.<br/><br/>Japanese people often forecast the year's fortune from the contents of Hatsuyume.<br/><br/>There is the saying "Ichi fuji ni taka san nasu," which represents highly auspicious tokens in Hatsuyume.<br/><br/>This means that the most auspicious one is Mount Fuji, the second one is a hawk, and the third one is an eggplant.<br/><br/>Also, dreams of death, disaster, excrement and blood also seem to auspicious.<br/><br/>On the other hand, dreams to be encouraged by oneself and to be chased seem to be bad.<br/><br/>In my Hatsuyume, I was riding my road bike with old friends.
