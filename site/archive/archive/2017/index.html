In my post just one year ago, I wrote about that December 31st is called 大晦日 "omisoka" in Japanese.<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/224394078701397240103991911399205800908" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/224394078701397240103991911399205800908</a><br/><br/>Today, as I declared in the post, I will introduce you to a Japanese traditional event held in omisoka.<br/><br/>It is 除夜の鐘 (joya no kane), the literal meaning of which is a temple bell of December 31st night.<br/><br/>In this event, the temple bell is struck 108 times across midnight.<br/><br/>It is said that the reason is because people have 108 earthly desires, and they are purified by striking the bell.<br/><br/>Also, 年越しそば (toshikoshi soba) is another famous traditional event held in omisoka.<br/><br/>I told you about it in the following post.<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/56610173602368085034687509221862048814" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/56610173602368085034687509221862048814</a>

<div class="date" hidden>Dec 30, 2017 20:00</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The end of the year is sometimes referred to as 年の瀬 (toshi no se) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The 年 (toshi) means "year" and the 瀬 (se) means "shallow area of a river."<br/><br/>Since the flow of water becomes faster in the shallow area of the river, it's difficult to cross over there by ship.<br/><br/>On the other hand, many Japanese people in the Edo period often used money on deferred payments, and they settled these bills at the end of the year.<br/><br/>By comparing such a rush at the end of the year with a shallow area of a river, this term 年の瀬 (toshi no se) was born.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I'd like to tell you the information about New Year holidays in Japan.<br/><br/>According to a survey conducted by a Japanese company, the most common last business day for Japanese workers in 2017 is today, December 29th.<br/><br/>This is because December 29th, 2017 is Friday.<br/><br/>Also, the most common first business day in 2018 seems to be January 4th.<br/><br/>That is to say, New Year holidays are five to six days for many Japanese workers.<br/><br/>Saturday and Sunday are included in them, so the actual holidays that are given specially for New Year are about three days.<br/><br/>I thought that this number is small, but I found that it was more than holidays of the US.

Today I did 餅つき (mochitsuki).<br/><br/>Mochitsuki is a traditional Japanese event that people make 餅 (mochi - rice cake) -- I explained about that just one year ago in the following entry.<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/76091474305243240897493045035997627438" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/76091474305243240897493045035997627438</a><br/><br/>Today, I'd like to talk about one accepted theory about the reason why Japanese people eat mochi on New Year holidays.<br/><br/>The theory says that it comes from 歯固めの儀 (hagatame no gi - teeth hardening ritual), which was held during the Heian period.<br/><br/>In this ritual, people ate hard food from January 1st to 3rd in order to make their teeth strong, while wishing for longevity and health.<br/><br/>Here mochi were used as hard food.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Sometimes it is important to talk with someone heart to heart.<br/><br/>To lay one's heart bare like this is expressed as 腹を割る (hara wo waru) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The 腹 (hara) means "stomach" and the 割る (waru) means "to split," so the literal meaning of idiom is "to split one's stomach."<br/><br/>Before the age of science, people seemed to believe that one’s stomach thought things, and one’s heart (mind) was located in the stomach.<br/><br/>Because of this, 腹を割る (hara wo waru - to split one's stomach) has come to mean to talk heart to heart.

I'd like to take a 屋形船 (yakatabune) someday.<br/><br/>屋形船 means a Japanese style boat that is equipped with a roof and tatami mats, and it is mainly used for enjoying meals and sightseeing while cruising.<br/><br/>Here the 屋形 (yakata) means a mansion of nobles and the 船 (fune/bune) means a boat/ship.<br/><br/>Formerly, 屋形船 was used by nobles for enjoying cherry blossom viewing, moon viewing,  and fireworks.<br/><br/>These days everyone can enjoy 屋形船, but the cost to reserve it is expensive, so it's not easy to take it.<br/><br/>If you have time, check for "yakatabune" or "屋形船" on Google Images.

Merry Christmas.<br/><br/>Have you ever heard the Japanese term クリぼっち (kuri bocchi)?<br/><br/>This is a slang term born on the Internet, which means to spend Christmas on your own.<br/><br/>The etymology is very simple -- クリぼっち (kuri bocchi) is a compound word of the クリスマス (kurisumasu - Christmas) and the ひとりぼっち (hitori bocchi - loneliness).<br/><br/>Since it's a standard to spend Christmas with a lover in Japan, even if you spend with your family, it may be called クリぼっち.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I will work at the university until late at night as usual.

This year will be over in about a week.<br/><br/>There is a Japanese parting greeting that is used only during this time of year.<br/><br/>It is 良いお年を (yoi otoshi wo).<br/><br/>The 良い (yoi) means "good" and the お年 means "year."<br/><br/>This expression is short for 良いお年をお迎えください (yoi otoshi wo omukae kudasai), where the お迎えください (omukae kudasai) means something like "to wish you a prosperous something."<br/><br/>I think that the most similar English expression to 良いお年を is "Have a happy new year."

During this time of year, a lot of 忘年会 (bounenkai) are held in Japan.<br/><br/>A bounenkai is a drinking party that is held at the end of the year, in order to forget the past year.<br/><br/>There is no religious meaning or particular style.<br/><br/>The 忘 (bou) means "to forget," the 年 (nen) means "year," and the 会 (kai) means "party," so 忘年会 (bounenkai) literally means "forget the part year party."<br/><br/>I think that End of the Year Party is very similar to bounenkai.<br/><br/>Incidentally, today I will participate in a bounenkai - this is the third time this week.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I sometimes interrupted others in the middle of talking.<br/><br/>Such an action is called 話の腰を折る (hanashi no koshi wo oru) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The 話 (hanashi) means "story/conversation," the 腰 (koshi) means "a lower back/waist," and the 折る (oru) means "to break," so the literal meaning of this term is "to break a lower back of conversation."<br/><br/>"A lower back" is a very important part of the body, and if it's hurt, it will become difficult to support your body.<br/><br/>Because of this, 話の腰を折る has come to mean to interrupt when someone is talking.

Yesterday, I introduced you to a common expression that is used when you want to go to the bathroom.<br/><br/>Today I'd like to talk about other Japanese expressions implying that you will go to the bathroom.<br/><br/>*お花摘みに行く* (*ohana tsumi ni iku* - I will go picking flowers): This is an expression for women.<br/><br/>*雉撃ちに行く* (*kiji uchi ni iku* - I will go pheasant hunting): This is an expression for men.<br/><br/>Originally, it seems that these expression was used to imply urinating/defecating on climbing.<br/><br/>This is because the posture of urinating/defecating in the grass is similar to the posture of flower picking or pheasant hunting.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I posted an entry about how to use a toilet yesterday.<br/><br/>Today I'd like to tell you about how to express in Japanese that you want to go to a bathroom.<br/><br/>The most simple expression is that "toile ni ittekimasu" (トイレに行ってきます - I will go to a toilet).<br/><br/>However, such a direct expression is not elegant.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the most common and accepted expression is "otearai ni ittekimasu" (お手洗いに行ってきます - I will go to an otearai), here the "otearai" (お手洗い) is a place where you wash your hands.<br/><br/>Japanese people have been sure to wash their hands carefully after urinating/defecating since a long time ago.<br/><br/>Because of this, "to go to a bathroom" has come to be expressed as "otearai ni iku" (お手洗いに行く - I will go to an otearai).

Of course you will flush a toilet after using it.<br/><br/>At this time, do you run the water in the sink after closing the lid of the toilet?<br/><br/>Or do you close the lid of the toilet after running the water in the sink?<br/><br/>(Please don't say that you don't close lids of toilets.)<br/><br/>According to the study at University of Leeds,if you flush a toilet while opening the lid, pathogens called Clostridium difficile contained in your feces will become aerosol, and they will scatter to 25 cm above the toilet seat.<br/><br/>It was also reported that the contamination was detected within 90 min after flushing.<br/><br/>From now on, all we should flush toilets after closing the lids.

I want to say some "guchi" (愚痴) now.<br/><br/>However, in most cases, since "guchi" makes others feel bad, I shouldn't say it.<br/><br/>"Guchi" means to say something silly or complain about something people have no power over.<br/><br/>Originally, this is a Buddhist term, which means that someone has no heart to understand the truth, or is ignorance.<br/><br/>After the beginning of the Edo period came, "guchi" came to be used to mean "to say something silly," and since the middle of the Edo period, it has come to mean "to complain about something people have no power over."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
These days, I'm annoyed with a neighborhood resident for singing loudly first thing in the morning.<br/><br/>If you want to express "in the morning," you can use the Japanese "asa kara" (朝から) or "asa ni" (朝に).<br/><br/>However, especially if you want to emphasize that it's early morning or it's a lack in common sense, you can imply it by using "asappara kara" (朝っぱらから) instead of "asa kara."<br/><br/>The "asappara" (朝っぱら) comes from "asahara" (朝腹) -- where the "asa" (朝) means "morning," the "hara" (腹) means "stomach," and the "asahara" means something like "one's empty stomach in the early morning (before breakfast)."<br/><br/>Because of this, "asappara" can imply that something happens early in the morning.

Japanese people often take an act called "enryo" (遠慮).<br/><br/>"Enryo" means "to refrain from words or deeds to others" or "to decline something."<br/><br/>The "en" (遠) means "far" and the "ryo" (慮) means "to give adequate consideration," so originally "enryo" meant "to give adequate consideration to far future."<br/><br/>If you give too much thought to your far future, you may not move into action soon.<br/><br/>Because of this, "enryo" has come to mean "to refrain from your attitude."<br/><br/>To take "enryo" is translated into English as "behave with modesty" or "respect someone's feeling."

Have you ever suffered from a bad deed that you did?<br/><br/>Getting into such a situation can be expressed using the Japanese proverb "mi kara deta sabi" (身から出た錆).<br/><br/>Here, the "mi" (身) means "sword blade" and the "sabi" (錆) means "rust," so the literal meaning of this term is "rust generated from a sword blade."<br/><br/>If you neglect to take care of your sword, rust will be generated from the blade, and you may lose your life in a critical moment.<br/><br/>Because of this, "mi kara deta sabi" has come to be used to mean to suffering from your own bad act.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are many superstitions in Japan.<br/><br/>Almost all of them have no scientific basis, but some have make sense.<br/><br/>For example, it is said that "It will rain if swallows fly at low altitude."<br/><br/>As a low pressure system approaches, small bugs/flies get less able to fly at high altitude, because moisture attaches to their wings.<br/><br/>Since these small bugs/flies are baits of swallows, when they fly at low altitude, swallows also fly low to catch them.<br/><br/>I heard that the rain forecast based on the behavior of swallows is reliable in many cases.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Have you ever experienced a situation that it was desperate, but there certainly was a hope.<br/><br/>Such a little hope is sometime called "ichiru no nozomi" (一縷の望み) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "ichi" (一) means "one" and the "ru" (縷) means "slender thread" or "slight," so the "ichiru" (一縷) means "something slight like a slender thread."<br/><br/>Also, since the "nozomi" (望み) means "hope," "ichiru no nozomi" means something like "a spark of hope" or "a ray of hope."<br/><br/>The "nozomi," which means "hope," is commonly used in daily conversation, but the is only used in the expression "ichiru no nozomi" in most cases.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The English word "secret" is usually translated into Japanese as "himitsu" (秘密), but it's can also translated as "naisho" (内緒).<br/><br/>"Naisho" is more colloquial and casual than "himitsu."<br/><br/>This word comes from a Buddhism term, "naishō" (内証), and it's a Chinese translation of a Sanskrit word, which means to tell the truth in your own mind.<br/><br/>Later, "naishō" came to mean "a secret that can't be known from the outside," then it changed to "naisho."<br/><br/>Incidentally, in the series of the Legend of Zelda, if you find a secret room and talk to a non-player character there, he said "minna ni naisho dayo" (ミンナニ ナイショダヨ - This is a secret between us) and give you a lot of Rupees (money).

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I introduced the Japanese word "dotanba," which means the last moment that you're required to make a decision.<br/><br/>There is the slang term "dotakyan," which was derived from this "dotanba."<br/><br/>"Dotakyan" is short for "dotanba de kyanseru (cancel)," and it means to cancel an appointment (to meet someone) at the last minute.<br/><br/>Originally, this term was a jargon used among the entertainment industry and the travel industry, but it has come to be used commonly (especially among young people) since around 1990.<br/><br/>Since "dotakyan" not only hurts someone but also makes you lose your trust, be careful not to do "dotakyan."

I don't like a situation called "dotanba" (土壇場) very much.<br/><br/>"Dotanba" means a critical moment or the last moment that you're required a decision.<br/><br/>The "do" (土) means "earthen," the "tan" (壇) means "platform," the "ba" (場) means "place," so the literal meaning of "dotanba" is "an earthen platform place."<br/><br/>Before the Edo period, "dotanba" was used in the literal meaning.<br/><br/>However, in the Edo period, criminals were made lie down on "dotanba" and were executed, so it has come to mean an execution place, and changed to the current meaning.

Today I would like to introduce the Japanese onomatopoeia "poka poka" (ぽかぽか), which has two different meanings.<br/><br/>Can you imagine what "poka poka" express?<br/><br/>In most cases, "poka poka" means comfortable warmth that you feel.<br/><br/>For example, "Haru no youki de karadaga poka poka suru" (春の陽気で体がぽかぽかする - I feel a comfortable warmth because of the spring sun.)<br/><br/>Also, this onomatopoeia is sometimes used to mean repeated tapping sounds in comical manga.<br/><br/>For example, "Kanojo ga kareshi wo poka poka to tataite iru" (彼女が彼氏をポカポカと叩いている - She is hitting her boyfriend repeatedly).

Have you ever acted like a spoiled child or say selfishness to your parents when you couldn't obtain what you wanted?<br/><br/>Doing such an act is called "dada wo koneru" (駄々をこねる) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "koneru" (こねる) means just something like "to say," but there are several theories about the meaning of the "dada" (駄々).<br/><br/>The most accepted theory is that the "dada" comes from "da" of "jidanda" (地団駄), which means to stamp your feet in frustration.<br/><br/>Another theory said that it comes from "iyada iyada" (いやだいやだ - No, no).

Yesterday, I used the Japanese term "unubore" (うぬぼれ), in order to admonish a student.<br/><br/>"Unubore" means that you convince yourself that you are a better person than you actually are -- in other words, it means that you get overconfident.<br/><br/>The "unu" means "oneself" and the "bore/hore" means "to fall for someone," so the literal meaning of "unubore" is "to fall for oneself." <br/><br/>You know, when you fall for yourself, you would believe that you are a great person/ you have a great ability.<br/><br/>Also, a person who has such a character is called "unubore-ya" (うぬぼれ屋).

I'm drinking "kōcha" (紅茶) right now.<br/><br/>The "kō" (紅) means "red" and the "cha" (茶) means "tea," so the literal meaning of "kōcha" is "red tea."<br/><br/>The etymology is very simple -- the "red" in "red tea" describes the color of the liquid. <br/><br/>In English, it is called just "tea" in most cases, but it's also called "black tea" due to the color of the oxidized leaves.<br/>(I also heard that "black tea" implies tea without milk, sugar or lemon.)<br/><br/>Incidentally, in the UK famous for tea, around 98% of tea is drank with milk.

I'm in a state called "aona ni shio" (青菜に塩) right now.<br/><br/>"Aona ni shio" is a Japanese idiom that implies a depressed state.<br/><br/>The "aona" (青菜) means "green leafy vegetables" such as spinach, and the "shio" (塩) means "salt."<br/><br/>Do you know what will happen if you sprinkle salt on green leafy vegetables?<br/><br/>Water contained in the leaves and stems will be lost, then the vegetables will wilt as if they would lose their energy.<br/><br/>Because of this, "aona ni shio" has come to mean that you lose your energy and get depressed.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I'm very sad now.<br/><br/>Because I had a interview for a new job and failed it.<br/><br/>If you want to express such a pained, sad, or unhappy feeling, you can use the Japanese verb "kanashii" (悲しい).<br/><br/>The kanji "悲" in "kanashii" (悲しい) is able to be divided into "非" and "心."<br/><br/>Since the "非" looks spread wings to left and right, it contains the meaning of "break/crack", and the "心" means "heart."<br/><br/>Therefore, the kanji "悲" implies that your heart break.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Never do an act called "manbiki" (万引き).<br/><br/>"Manbiki" means to take items of a store away without payment and permission -- it's called "shoplifting" in English.<br/><br/>The most accepted theory about the etymology of "manbiki" is that it was changed from "mabiki" (間引き).<br/><br/>The "ma" (間) means "between something," the "biki/hiki" (引き) means "to pull out," and "mabiki" usually means "thinning" in agricultural science.<br/><br/>It's thought that since removing items from a shelf is similar to thinning, "mabiki" came to mean "shoplifting," then it changed to "manbiki."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
"Suit" is often called just "sūtsu" (スーツ) in Japan, but it sometimes called "sebiro" (背広).<br/><br/>The "se" (背) means "(person's) back" and the "biro/hiro" (広) means "wide," so I thought that the term "sebiro" derived from Japanese words.<br/><br/>However, according to the Internet, the most accepted theory about the etymology of "sebiro" is that "civil" of "civil clothes" changed to "sebiro."<br/><br/>Also, there is another theory that said that it comes from "Savile" of "Savile Row" where many well-established tailors have opened in London.<br/><br/>There are many surprises when I'm studying about etymologies.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I'd like to introduce the Japanese word "kosoku" (姑息), but you need to pay attention when using this word.<br/><br/>Because over 70 percent of Japanese people (around 90 percent of young Japanese people) used this word in a wrong meaning.<br/><br/>The "ko" (姑) means "a while" and the "soku" (息) means "break/rest," so "kosoku" means "temporizing" or "makeshift."<br/><br/>However, these days, "kosoku" is used to mean "cowardly."<br/><br/>It's thought that the reason is because cowards tend to do makeshift acts, or the sound is similar to "koshaku" (小癪), which means "annoying."<br/><br/>Since too many people have misused this word, I think that in the near future, "kosoku" will include two different meanings officially.

If you make a grandiose claim or exaggerate something, you may be said "oogesa" (大げさ) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "oo" (大) means "big" and the "gesa/kesa" (げさ/けさ) means "Buddhist stole," so originally this term was used to mean a big Buddhist term.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there were Japanese terms: "ohokenashi" (おほけなし) and its changed form "ohogesa" (おほげさ), which mean "inordinate" or "bold."<br/><br/>Becaue of the meaning and the sound, "oogesa" has come to have the current meaning.

If you want to express that it's easy to do something or you don't mind something, you can use the Japanese term "hecchara" (へっちゃら).<br/><br/>Originally, this term was called "heichara" (平ちゃら), but it has come to become "hecchara" in order to strengthen the impression.<br/><br/>The "hei" (平) comes from "heiki" (平気), which means "without hesitation" or "don't mind," and the "chara" (ちゃら) means "joke" or "bullshit."<br/><br/>It's thought that "hecchara" implies that you can do something while saying a joke without hesitation.

If you want to express "it's not a problem at all" or "it's so easy," you can say the Japanese term "he demonai" (屁でもない).<br/><br/>The "he" (屁) means "fart" and the "demonai" (でもない) means "inferior to," so the literal meaning of this term is "it's inferior to a fart."<br/><br/>This term comes from the thought that things that are inferior to a fart will never become a problem.<br/><br/>Incidentally, there is a Japanese slang term, "he no kappa" (屁の河童), which also contains "he" (屁 - fart).<br/><br/>The etymology of this slang term is not related to "fart," but this has the same meaning of "he demonai."<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/191665208695223752666684613979550944204" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/191665208695223752666684613979550944204</a>

There is a Japanese term: "melo melo" (めろめろ/メロメロ).<br/><br/>Can you guess what this term means?<br/><br/>"Melo melo" means that someone has a loose face or attitude by being madly in love.<br/><br/>For example, you can say "melo melo da" (メロメロだ - I'm melo melo) to your lover or grand children.<br/><br/>The most accepted theory about the etymology of "melo melo" is that it comes from "mela mela" (めらめら), which is an onomatopoeia that represents spreading fire.<br/><br/>Incidentally, there is "melo melo" as a Pokemon's move, and this is translated into English as "Attract."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There is a Japanese idiom, "tsuba wo tsukeru" (唾をつける).<br/><br/>The "tsuba" (唾) means "spit" and the "tsukeru" (つける) means "to put on," so the literal meaning of the combination is "to put your spit on something."<br/><br/>Originally this idiom was mainly used for food.<br/><br/>Just imagine - you don't want to eat food wet with someone's spit, do you?<br/><br/>Therefore, "tsuba wo tsukeru" means to do something in advance in order to prevent other people from getting what you want.<br/><br/>Incidentally, if you add "mayuni" (眉に - on your eyebrow) and say "mayuni tsuba wo tsukeru" (or "mayutsuba" for short), the meaning will differ substantially from this idiom.<br/><br/>You can check the meaning of "mayutsuba" on the following URL.<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/35103209355274424265303829210995655726" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/35103209355274424265303829210995655726</a>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Since I ate a crab last night, I'd like to talk about a Japanese proverb related to "crab,"<br/><br/>It's "kani no yokobai" (蟹の横這い).<br/><br/>The "kani" (蟹/カニ) means "crab" and the "yokobai" (横這い) means "sideways movement," so the literal meaning of the combination is "sideways movement of a crab."<br/><br/>Although the sideways movement of a crab looks unnatural for us, it's the most appropriate way of moving for crabs.<br/><br/>Therefore, this proverb says that even if it looks inconvenience for others, the way might appropriate for the person himself/herself.

In Japan, "manma" (まんま) is a baby word that means  a "meal."<br/><br/>According to the Internet, one of the easiest word to pronounce for babies is "ma-ma," and this fact is common in the world.<br/><br/>Because of this, "mama" has come to mean "mother" in many countries.<br/><br/>On the other hand, since Japanese people thought that babies said "ma-ma" in order to request a meal (and it was sounded like "manma"), "manma" has come to mean a meal in Japan.<br/><br/>Incidentally, since these days it has widespread to call your mother "mama" even in Japan, if you want to say "mother, I'm hungry" in baby language, it will be "mama, manma."

The most common Japanese word that means "eye" is "me" (め/目), but you can also use another word "manako" (まなこ/眼).<br/><br/>The "ma" (ま) of "manako" a changed form of "me" (目 - eye), the "na" (な) means "of," and the "ko" (こ) means "child."<br/><br/>Therefore, the literal meaning of "manako" is a "child of your eye."<br/><br/>This comes from the fact that "manako" was used to mean just a black part of your eye.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the pronunciation of "namako" (ナマコ) is very similar to "manako" (まなこ - eye), but "namako" means "sea cucumber."

I have a sore "nodo" (喉) now.<br/><br/>"Nodo" refers to a back of your mouth, where the part above your esophagus and trachea -- it's a throat.<br/><br/>In the past, this Japanese word is called "nomido" (のみど).<br/><br/>The "nomi" (のみ) means "to drink" and the "do/to" (ど/と) means "door," so the combination "nomido" refers to "door for drinking." <br/><br/>I think that it's not necessary to explain any more why "nodo" has come to mean "throat."<br/><br/>Also, "nodo" can mean "singing voice," "weak point," and "a part that binds a book."

There are various diseases in the world.<br/><br/>Japanese people usually say "(disease name) ni kakaru" or "(disease name) wo wazurau" when they catch the disease.<br/><br/>Of course you can say "kaze ni kakaru" (風邪にかかる) or "kaze wo wazurau" (風邪を患う) -- where "kaze" means "cold."<br/><br/>However, only in the case of "kaze," we often say "kaze wo hiku" (風邪をひく).<br/><br/>The "hiku" means "to drag," and it seems to be derived from the fact that ancient Chinese people thought that you would catch a cold when dragging bad vibes into your body.<br/><br/>By the way, I'm having a cold now.

Now I'm doing my work, which is called "yonabe" (夜なべ).<br/><br/>"Yonabe" means a work that is done in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>The "yo" (夜) means "night," but there are several theories about what the "nabe" (なべ) means.<br/><br/>The most accepted theory says that the "nabe" is written in kanji as"鍋," which means a one pot dish.<br/><br/>According to this theory, the word "yonabe" comes from the fact that people work at night while eating "nabe" (one pot dish).<br/><br/>Also, another theory says that "nabe" is written in kanji as "延べ," which means "extension" -- this implies that your work is extended until night.

I like dogs, but many terms/idioms that use dog have negative meanings.<br/><br/>The idiom "kamase inu" (かませ犬), that I will introduce today, is one of them.<br/><br/>The "kamase" (かませ) means "to let someone bite," "inu" (犬) means "dog," and the combination means a weak dog that is prepared to be bitten by another dog in dog fighting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this weak dog (kamase inu) is just used to give a confidence to the fighting dog.<br/><br/>Because of this background, "kamase inu" is also used to mean a weak person who emphasizes a main character.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the top character of the kamase-inu ranking in anime is Yamcha of Dragon Ball.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In recent years, the number of young people who are absent from school or work due to "kebyou" (仮病) has been increased.<br/><br/>The "ke" (仮) means "temporary" or "fake," the "byou" (病) means "illness," and the combination "kebyou" means "to pretend to be illness."<br/><br/>As the symptoms of kebyou, headache, stomach ache, nausea and fever are often used.<br/><br/>Especially headache and stomach ache seem to be commonly used because it's difficult to confirm the symptom by a third party.<br/><br/>Also, people also use "miuchi no fukou" (身内の不幸 - bereavement) as a reason for playing hooky.<br/><br/>They make a story something like that their families or relatives were dead.<br/><br/>You should never tell such a lie.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are several Japanese expressions that means to tell a lie.<br/><br/>The term "nimaijita" (二枚舌) is one of them.<br/><br/>The "nimai" (二枚) means "two pieces," and the "jita/shita" (舌) means "tongue," so the literal meaning of "nimaijita" is "two tongues."<br/><br/>However, this term is used to mean that someone tells a lie or say contradictory things.<br/><br/>Since people who say lies or contradictions fluently are as if they have two tongues and each one says different things, this term has come to be used.<br/><br/>Incidentally, today I learned English has a similar expression -- "speaking with a forked tongue" means to tell a lie.

Have you ever been excited due to a feeling that you want to show someone your skills or power?<br/><br/>If you want to represent such a feeling, you can say the Japanese idiom "ude ga naru" (腕が鳴る).<br/><br/>The "ude" (腕) means "arm," the "naru" means "making a sound," so the literal meaning of "ude ga naru" is "one's arms make a sound."<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I couldn't find the etymology about this idiom.<br/><br/>However, since "ude" can also mean "skill" or "power," probably Japanese people thought that "ude" lets us know to want to be exerted by making a sound.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There is the Japanese adjective word (slang expression), "dasai" (ダサい), which means "uncool" or "countrified."<br/><br/>This word has been used among young people in the Kanto region since the 1970s, but the exact etymology hasn't been clarified.<br/><br/>One of the most accepted theories about the etymology is that it comes from "inaka" (田舎), which means "countryside."<br/><br/>The theory says that the kanji of the noun "inaka" (田舎) can be read as "dasha" by the Chinese reading, and it changed to an adjective by adding "i" (い).<br/><br/>Another theory says that it comes from "datte saitama dakara" (だって埼玉だから - Because it's Saitama), which is a phrase for ridiculing Saitana citizens by Tokyo citizens.

There is a Japanese term, "ookina osewa" (大きなお世話).<br/><br/>Here the "ookina" (大きな) means "big," and the "osewa" (お世話) means "care" or "favor."<br/><br/>You might think that the combination "ookina osewa" has some kind of good meanings.<br/><br/>However, it means "unnecessary care" or "unwelcome favor," and is used when you want to refuse someone's favor/act.<br/><br/>In addition, since this term is usually used containing an ironic meaning, please be careful when you use it.<br/><br/>If you want to say it in English, you can say "None of your business" or "Leave me alone."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Have you ever surprised the hell out of someone?<br/><br/>This action is sometimes called "dogimo wo nuku" (度肝を抜く) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "kimo/gimo" (肝) originally means "liver," but it can also mean "heart" or "soul."<br/><br/>Also, the "do" (度) is a prefix for emphasising the following word, and the "nuku" (抜く) means "to pull something out."<br/><br/>Therefore, the literal meaning of "dogimo wo nuku" is "to pull someone's heart out," and it implies that you surprise someone enough to pull the heart out.<br/><br/>If you want to mean just "to surprise someone" in Japanese, you can say "odorokasru" (驚かせる).

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
To shorten and organize something is called "hashoru" (はしょる) in Japanese.<br/><br/>"Hashoru" comes from "hashioru," which is written in kanji as "端折る."<br/><br/>Here the "hashi" (端) means "edge," and the "oru" (折る) means "to fold."<br/><br/>Therefore, this term originally meant an action of folding a hem of kimono (traditional Japanese clothes) and putting it into obi (kimono's belt-like accessory).<br/><br/>The meaning has been extended, and these days it is often used to mean to shorten an explanation or a story.<br/><br/>Note that "hashoru" is sometimes regarded as oral language or an slang term.<br/><br/>If you want to say it more formally, use the verb "shōryaku-suru" (省略する).

There is a Japanese phrase, "suna wo kamu youna omoi" (砂を噛むような思い).<br/><br/>The "suna" (砂) means "sand," the "kamu" means "to bite," and the "omoi" means "feeling," so the literal meaning of the combination is "feeling like biting sand."<br/><br/>Can you guess how this phrase is used?<br/><br/>Today, I will show you three choices, so please think about which one is correct.<br/><br/>A. Extremely frustrating feeling.<br/><br/>B. Feeling that something isn't interesting.<br/><br/>C. Feeling that everything is happy.<br/><br/>This term represents that you feel things are dull because it has no taste.<br/><br/>Therefore, the correct answer is the second choice.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The Japanese word "kaze" has two different meanings; "wind" (風) and "(common) cold" (風邪), and both are often used in daily conversation.<br/><br/>The "ka" of "kaze" means a movement of the atmosphere, and "ze" means wind, so originally "kaze" meant either of them.<br/><br/>The reason why it has come to mean a cold (a kind of illness) is because the illness could spread due to the movement of the atmosphere or the wind.<br/><br/>You can use "kaze" (風 - wind) like: "Kaze ga fuku" (風が吹く - The wind blows), or "Kaze ga tsumetai" (風が冷たい - The wind is cold).<br/><br/>You can use "kaze" (風邪 - cold) like: "Kaze wo hiku" (風邪をひく - I get a cold), or "Kaze wo utsusareru" (風邪をうつされる - I pick up a cold).

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A severe situation that you can't  turn around is called "naraku no soko" (奈落の底) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "naraku" (奈落) comes from a Buddhism term (Sanskrit language), "naraka," which means "hell," and the "soko" (底) means "bottom."<br/>("Naraka" was translated into Chinese as "奈落" (naraku), and it has also come to be used in Japan.)<br/><br/>Therefore, "naraku no soko" originally means "the bottom of hell," and now it can mean "rock bottom" or "severe situation that you can't turn around."<br/><br/>For example, it's used as "naraku no soko ni ochiru" (奈落の底に落ちる - I fall into a bottomless pit).

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Nonsense plays, theatrical behavior, and ridiculous acts are called "chaban" (茶番) or "chaban-geki" (茶番劇) in Japan.<br/>(Here the "geki" (劇) means "drama/play.")<br/><br/>"Chaban" is short for "chaban kyogen" (茶番狂言 - chaban comedic drama), which means a traditional short comedic drama using accessible things by poor actors or amateurs.<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "cha" (茶) means "tea," and the "ban" (番) means "role," so "chaban" originally meant waiting staff who serve tea.<br/><br/>Since they often performed "kyogen" (狂言 - short comedic drama) as a sideshow of Kabuki (traditional Japanese drama performed by male actors), it came to be called "chaban kyogen," and it has come to have the current meaning.

There is a Japanese term "chienetsu" (知恵熱), which is often used incorrectly.<br/><br/>The "chie" (知恵) means "wisdom," and the "netsu" (熱) means "fever," but can you guess the meaning of the combination, "chienetsu?"<br/><br/>"Chienetsu" means unexplained fever found in infants in half a year to a year after birth.<br/><br/>The etymology comes from the fact that this symptom occurs when infants start to get wisdom.<br/><br/>However, it's often used incorrectly to mean "fever due to an excessive use of one's head."<br/><br/>Incidentally, this fever is referred to as "teething fever" in English because it occurs when teeth begin to grow.

When I was a child, I wanted to do "otona gai" (大人買い) someday.<br/><br/>The "otona" (大人) means "adult," and "gai" (買い) means "to buy," but it's by no means a illegal thing like "to buy an adult."<br/><br/>"Otona gai" means to buy a lot of blind package products that contains toys or cards at once.<br/><br/>Of course, these products are sold for children, so basically they are cheap ones that shouldn't be purchased a lot at once.<br/><br/>However, if you are an adult, you can buy a large quantity of these products by the power of money.<br/><br/>Because of this, such an act has come to be called "otona gai," and now it is also used to mean just "bulk buying" for general products.

Do you know what "green pepper" is called in Japanese?<br/><br/>As I wrote in this title, it's "pīman" (ピーマン).<br/><br/>This word comes from a French "piment" (or a Spanish "pimento"), which means "chilli pepper."<br/><br/>When it was brought to Japan, the term was slightly misunderstood, and we have come to call mild peppers (green/bell peppers) "pīman."<br/><br/>Although "pīman" comes from French, it is called "poivron" in French.<br/><br/>Incidentally, since "pīman" is written in katakana and has no kanji, most Japanese people understand that this is a loanword.<br/><br/>However, if a Japanese regard "pīman" as English and say something like "I like pīman (pee man)," he may be considered as a strange person.

Is there something that you don't like instinctively without any specific reason.<br/><br/>In Japan, we use a verb "kirai" (嫌い) when meaning to dislike something, and if there is no clear reason for the feeling of the dislike, we will say "kegirai" by adding "ke" (毛), meaning "hair."<br/><br/> This term comes from the fact that beasts and birds (especially females) choose heterosexual ones depending on the hair/coats.<br/><br/>For example, it's used like the following:<br/><br/>"Seiji wo kegirai suru" (政治を毛嫌いする - I hate politics anyway).<br/><br/>"Josei ni kegirai sareru" (女性に毛嫌いされる - I'm disliked by women with no reason (actually there might be some reasons though)).

Unfortunately, today's weather is "shinotsuku ame" (篠突く雨).<br/><br/>"Shinotsuku ame" means a pelting rain as much as it could pierce the ground.<br/><br/>The "shino" (篠) is "shinodake" (篠竹), which means small bamboo, and the "tsuku" (突く) means "prod."<br/><br/>Therefore "shinotsuku" (篠突く) means that you gather small bamboos and prod them to the ground.<br/><br/>Also, the "ame" means "rain."<br/><br/>That is to say, "shinotsuku ame" implies a strong and high density rain like gathered small bamboos.<br/><br/>Although this is a little old-fashioned term and is not used much now, I think that you will be cool if you can use it appropriately.

These days in Japan, "lunchmate syndrome" has become a problem.<br/><br/>Lunchmate syndrome is a symptom that causes a kind of anxiety or fear when there is no people to eat together at your school or workplace.<br/><br/>It's thought that people with this symptom think something like the following:<br/><br/>"A person who eats alone has no friends. The reason is because he/she is unattractive and valueless."<br/><br/>These people really don't want others to see the scene of having a meal alone -- some of them eat the meal in a restroom (this act is called "benjo-meshi" (便所飯 - a meal in a restroom)), and some give up on the meal.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
To push one's opinion or way through forcely is called "gorioshi" (ゴリ押し) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "gori" (ゴリ) means a kind of fish, and the "oshi" (押し) means to push.<br/><br/>Gori are freshwater fish living on the bottom of the river, and they stick to rocks of the bottom using their sucker-like abdominal fins.<br/><br/>In order to capture these gori, first people fix a net on the bottom of the river.<br/><br/>Then several people make a circle, and force gori to move to above the net.<br/><br/>This fishing method is called "gorioshi ryo" (ゴリ押し漁 - gorioshi fishing), and as you can guess, this is the etymology of "gorioshi."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Since Japanese has few sounds, there are so many homonyms.<br/><br/>Among them, the homonym that has the most number of different meanings is "koushou" (こうしょう).<br/><br/>Amazingly, "koushou" has 48 different meanings.<br/><br/>It is very hard for anyone to use all of them well in conversation, but fortunately the most common meanings of "koushou" are just the following three:<br/><br/>"交渉," meaning "negotiation."<br/><br/>"高尚," meaning "elegance."<br/><br/>"校章," meaning "school seal."<br/><br/>In my opinion, other meanings of "kosho" are professional or very formal, so they're not usually used.

<div class="date" hidden>Oct 25, 2017 12:15</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I often use the Japanese term "tonton byōshi" (とんとん拍子), when things go as I want them to.<br/><br/>The "tonton" (とんとん) of "tonton byōshi" is an onomatopoeia that represents the sound of stepping on the floor rhythmically while aligning with clapping of his/her teacher.<br/><br/>Therefore, just "tonton" can mean that things go well, but this term also has other meanings, such as the sound of hitting something or that profits/losses between two are the same.<br/><br/>If you add the term "byōshi" (拍子), which means rhythm, it can clearly mean that things go as you expect.<br/><br/>For example, you can use it like "Kōshō ga tonton byōshi ni susumu" (交渉がとんとん拍子に進む - The negociation is going along swimmingly).

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
When I watch TV shows or the Internet, I sometimes hear the term "imoppoi" (いもっぽい) or "imokusai" (いも臭い).<br/><br/>The "imo" means "potato," and the literal meanings of "imoppoi" and "imokusai" are "it's like a potato" and "it smells like potatoes," respectively.<br/><br/>Both of them are used as insults, and they actually mean "it's countrified" or "it's dowdy."<br/>(These days they are also used to mean just "it's not cool.")<br/><br/>It's thought that these terms were born by imagining foul potatoes in the soil.<br/><br/>They're sometimes used like "imoi" (いもい) for short.<br/><br/>Incidentally, in video games or something, you can hear the verb form "imoru" (いもる), which means to withdraw into his/her own territory and do nothing.

There are many "noraneko" (野良猫) in Japan.<br/><br/>Norameko means a cat that lives in the human living area and is not owned by a particular person.<br/><br/>Here the "nora" (野良) means "field," and "neko" (猫) means "cat."<br/><br/>Also, if the cat becomes a wild animal outside the sphere of human habitation, it will called "noneko" (野猫).<br/><br/>Incidentally, if the noraneko has a bad habit such as stealing something belongs to human beings, the cat will be called "doraneko" (どら猫).<br/><br/>The national Japanese manga/anime "doraemon" (ドラえもん) comes from the doraneko.

The most common morning greeting in Japan is "ohayo" (おはよう).<br/><br/>If you want to say it more politely, you can say "ohayo gozaimasu" (おはようございます).<br/><br/>It is said that "ohayo" comes from Kabuki (traditional Japanese dance-drama performed by male actors).<br/><br/>In Kabuki, actors reached a dressing room at a much earlier time than the performance time due to makeup and practice.<br/><br/>People who had background roles said words of consolation to the actors, just something like "ohayai shukkin gokuro samadesu" (お早い出勤ご苦労様です - Thank you for your erarly attendance), and it has come to be "ohayo."<br/><br/>Because of this, in some occupations on a round-the-clock basis, "ohayo" is used through all day as an attendance greeting.

I think that "kogarashi" (木枯らし) will blow in a few days.<br/><br/>"Kogarashi" is strong cold winds that are blew from late autumn to early winter.<br/><br/>According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, if a wind blows from the north at a speed of 8m/s or more after the pressure pattern became a typical winter one (high-pressure area to the west, and the low-pressure area to the east), the wind will be regarded as "kogarashi."<br/><br/>The etymology of this term is very simple.<br/><br/>The "ko" (木) of "kogarashi" means "tree," and the "garashi" (枯らし) means "to blight green things."<br/><br/>Therefore, "kogarashi" implies a wind that is a strong/cold wind enough to blight trees.

The Japanese word "manaita" (まな板) means a board that is used when cutting ingredients, that is a cutting board.<br/><br/>Here the "mana" (まな) of "manaita" means "fish," and "ita" (板) means "board."<br/><br/>Therefore, it's thought that in the past manaita meant a board just for cooking fish.<br/><br/>Until recently manaita represented a cutting board made of wood, but now it's usually made by plastic or rubber due to the antibacterial property.<br/><br/>Incidentally, please be careful not to say "manaita" to a small breasted woman.<br/><br/>Since manaita is usually flat, it sometimes used as a slang term that implies a woman who has small and flat breasts.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In some countries, there are several definitions about the classification of vegetable and fruit like the following.<br/><br/>・It's a fruit when it has seeds, whereas it's a vegetable when it has no seeds, but there're some exceptions. <br/><br/>・When processing to a paste, a fruit will become jam, whereas a vegetable will become sauce.<br/>(According to this definition, if tomato is a fruit, it will become tomato jam instead of tomato sauce.)<br/><br/>Incidentally, in the past in the US, 10 percents tariffs was applied to vegetables, and fruits were excluded.<br/><br/>Because of this, a trading merchant tried to import tomatoes as fruit, but in 1893, the US Supreme Court decided that tomato is a vegetable because it don't dessert.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the debate about the classification of vegetable and fruit has continued, and there seems to be no definitive criteria for it yet.

In my previous post, I wrote something like "eggplant is a vegetable," but a commenter pointed out that "eggplant is a fruit."<br/><br/>Thanks to this comment, I noticed an interesting fact that the definitions of vegetable and fruit are different depending on the country/region.<br/><br/>Actually, there are no clear definitions between them in most countries including Japan, but many Japanese people believe that eggplant is a vegetable.<br/><br/>According to the classification proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan, herbaceous plants are vegetables, and plants grown on trees are fruits.<br/><br/>Therefore, tomato, watermelon, melon, and strawberry are classified as vegetable, though foreigners might not believe it.<br/><br/>Continue to Part 2.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I introduced the etymology of "nasu" (茄子 - eggplant).<br/><br/>Today I'd like to talk about a Japanese proverb that uses the word, "Aaki-nasu wa yome ni kuwasuna" (秋茄子は嫁に食わすな).<br/><br/>The literal meaning of it is "Don't let daughter-in-law eat autumn eggplants," but there are several interpretations about this.<br/><br/>Commonly, this proverb is often used to mean that autumn eggplants are very delicious, so it should not let hateful daughter-in-law eat them.<br/><br/>In addition, it's sometimes used to mean that daughter-in-law/wife blessed with a baby shouldn't eat eggplants too much because they chill the body, or since autumn eggplants have few seeds, it may become difficult to make a baby (this is a kind of superstition).

Do you like a kind of vegetable called "nasu" (ナス)?<br/><br/>Nasu is a vegetable native to India, and is grown from summer to autumn.<br/><br/>In English, it is called "eggplant" due to the shape.<br/><br/>Previously in Japan, "nasu" is commonly called "nasubi" (なすび).<br/><br/>There are several theories about the etymology of "nasubi."<br/><br/>For example, there are a theory that it comes from "natsumi" (夏実 - summer berry) due to the harvest period, and a theory that it comes from "nasumi" (中酸実 - berry having a sour center) due to the taste.<br/><br/>To tell you the truth, I don't like the texture of eggplants very much.

I think that everyone would like to praise himself/herself sometimes.<br/><br/>To praise oneself is often referred to as "jigajisan" (自画自賛) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Here the "ji" (自) means "my" or "myself," and "ga" (画) means "painting."<br/><br/>Also, in Oriental paintings, inscriptions/poetry related to the painting are called "san" (賛).<br/><br/>That is to say, the original meaning of "jigajisan" is to write an inscription/poetry of your painting.<br/><br/>It is thought that since the kanji "賛" (san) include the meaning of "praise," this term has come to mean "praising oneself" or "self-admiration."

Since there are so many homonyms in Japanese, I think that it's hard for foreigners to learn these Japanese words.<br/><br/>Because of this, I will also introduce Japanese homonyms on Lang-8 from today.<br/>(To tell you the truth, no longer I have little topics related to Japanese etymologies.)<br/><br/>Today I'd like to talk about the very common Japanese word, "ame" (あめ).<br/><br/>"Ame" has mainly two different meanings -- "rain" (雨) and "candy" (飴).<br/><br/>If you accent "a" of "ame," it will imply "rain," and if you accent "me," it will imply "candy."<br/><br/>"Ame" (雨 - rain) comes from "ame" (天 - sky) or "amamizu" (天水 - meteoric water), whereas "ame" (飴 - candy) comes from "amai" (甘い - sweet).<br/><br/>Incidentally, in the Kansai region (western Japan), "ame" (飴 - candy) is often called "ame-chan" by attaching "chan" ("chan" is a suffix used for girls or kids).

People who do a careless thing without thinking are called "occhoko choi" (おっちょこちょい) in Japanese.<br/><br/>It is thought that this term is composed of three words -- "o," "choko," and "choi."<br/><br/>The "o" is an interjection that is used when you're surprised, or is a just prefix.<br/><br/>The "choko" comes from an onomatopoeia, "choko choko" (ちょこちょこ), which represents that you move around quickly.<br/><br/>The "choi" comes from "choito" (ちょいと), which means a trivial matter.<br/><br/>That is to say, "occhoko choi" implies that you move around by yourself due to a trivial matter and surprise/worry other people.

In Japan, fish is often classified into two categories; akami-zakana (赤身魚 - fish having red flesh) and shiromi-zakana (白身魚 - fish having white flesh).<br/>(Strictly speaking, the classification is based on the amount of hemoglobin or myoglobin contained in the flesh.)<br/><br/>Akami-zakana, such as scads, mackerels, sauries and tunas, have a deep taste, contain a lot of fat, and are rich in iron.<br/><br/>On the other hand, shiromi-zakana, such as porgies, flatfishes, pufferfish and salmons, are balnd in taste, low in fat and rich in protein.<br/><br/>Salmons are often misunderstood as akami-zakana because of the reddish color of the flesh, but it's because they eat plankton called krill containing red pigment.<br/><br/>Incidentally, fishes having blue back, such as scads and mackerels, are also called "ao-zakana" (青魚 - blue fish).

Are you a person who loses your temper easily or gets bored quickly?<br/><br/>Such a personality is called "tanki" (短気) in Japan.<br/><br/>Here "tan" (短) of "tanki" means "short," and "ki" (気) means "temper."<br/><br/>Also, there is a famous Japanese proverb, "tanki wa sonki" (短気は損気 - tanki makes sonki).<br/><br/>This proverb means that if you lose your temper easily, you will make a loss.<br/><br/>Since "ki" (気) of "sonki" is added to "son" (損 - loss) for matching with the sound of "tanki," it has no meaning.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are several Japanese terms that describe a pleasure.<br/><br/>Today I'd like to talk about "daigomi" (醍醐味) among them.<br/><br/>"Daigomi" means a true pleasure or depth of favor.<br/><br/>The "daigo" (醍醐) of "daigomi" is a Buddhist term, and it means a high-grade milk product that is made from cow or sheep milk through various processes.<br/><br/>Because "daigomi" (醍醐味 - taste of daigo) is pure and the bast taste, it originally means "the best thing/teaching" in Buddhism, and it has come to mean the current meaning.<br/><br/>Some people think that "daigo" is equivalent to yogurt in the modern meaning.

In a traditional Japanese residence, we often set a very thick pillar in the center of the house.<br/><br/>This pillar is called "daikokubashira" (大黒柱).<br/><br/>"Daikokubashira" is composed of three kanji, "大" (big), "黒" (black), and "柱" (pillar), but it's not usually black.<br/><br/>There are several theories about the etymology.<br/><br/>One is that it comes from "Daigokuden bashira" (大極殿柱), which is pillars in Daigokuden (大極殿).<br/><br/>(The Daigokuden is a main hall of Chodoin (朝堂院 - a state chamber of the Greater Imperial Palace).)<br/><br/>The other theory is that it comes from Daikokuten (大黒天), who is the god of wealth.<br/><br/>Because of the importance, "daikokubashira" also represents a person who supports a group such as family or country.

Now I am falling into a state called "katsu katsu" (かつかつ).<br/><br/>"Katsu katsu" represents a state that someone is barely keeping a certain condition, or a state that someone can't afford anything.<br/><br/>It is said that this term was born by repeating the old Japanese word "katsu" (かつ), which means "narrowly" or "barely."<br/><br/>You can use it something like "Schedule ga katsu katsu da" (スケジュールがかつかつだ - I have a tight schedule) or "Katsu katsu no seikatsu wo okuru" (かつかつの生活を送る - I'm living hand to mouth).<br/><br/>If you want to mean the opposite meaning of "katsu katsu," you can use "yoyu ga aru" (余裕がある - having the luxury) or "yutori ga aru" (ゆとりがある - having enough leeway).

Tonight is "jūgoya" (十五夜).<br/><br/>The "jūgo" (十五) means "fifteen," the "ya" (夜) means "night," so the literal meaning of the composite is "fifteenth night."<br/><br/>Actually, "jūgoya" means a full moon night around August 15th in the lunar calendar.<br/><br/>Since the date was based on the phases of the moon in the lunar calendar, August 15th at that time is currently from the middle of September to the beginning of October.<br/><br/>In the night, people enjoy watching the moon with family while decorating Tsukimi Dango (月見団子 - rice dumplings for moon viewing) and Japanese pampas grass.<br/><br/>Incidentally, "jūgoya" is also called "chūjū no meigetsu" (中秋の名月 - harvest moon).

Have you ever had too much fun and let yourself get carried away?<br/><br/>Such an act is called "hame wo hazusu" (羽目を外す) in Japan.<br/><br/>It is said that the "hame" of "hame wo hazusu" comes from "hami/hame" (馬銜), which is a rod-like metal harness that is used to control horses.<br/><br/>If you take the hame off from a horse ("hazusu" means to take something off), the horse will act freely and you won't able to control it.<br/><br/>Because of this, "hame wo hazusu" (taking a harness off) has come to have the current meaning.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A few days ago, the clothing shopping site "ZOZOTOWN" started liberal shipping service (it's not free shipping).<br/><br/>This service is that you can decide a shipping fee freely (within the range of 0 yen to 3000 yen), according to your feeling or circumstance.<br/><br/>Many Japanese shopping sites provide free shipping service, but it's because the shipping fee is contained in the price of goods in most cases.<br/><br/>Since there is no tipping custom in Japan, most Japanese people may choose 0 yen as the shipping fee.<br/><br/>However, the shipping fee is set to 400 yen by default, and the fee selection menu shows 100 yen as the lowest fee.<br/><br/>Therefore, if you want to select free shipping, you have to select "Others" and type "0" on the keyboard.<br/><br/>I think that many people will pay 100 yen or 400 yen as shipping fee due to this a little confusing system.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I think that recently the Japanese word "sushi" has come to be used in various countries.<br/><br/>Among various kind of sushi, do you know "inari zushi" (稲荷寿司)?<br/><br/>"Inari zushi" is a sushi made by stuffing with vinegared rice in a deep-fried tofu (bean curd).<br/><br/>In some Japanese shrines, the Shinto god Inari (稲荷) is enshrined.<br/><br/>Also, we have served fried tofu to these shrines, because shinshi (神使 - divine servant) of the god is fox, and it has been believed that the favorite food of foxes is the fried tofu.<br/>(Since foxes are actually carnivorous, this theory is wrong.)<br/><br/>Because of this, dishes that contain fried food has been called "inari," then "inari zushi" was born.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
When people are invited to play or drinking parties in Japan, some often say "iketara iku" (行けたら行く).<br/><br/>Although "iketara iku" literally means "I'll go if I can," this phrase seems to be often used when you don't want to go.<br/><br/>In fact, according to an questionnaire survey, most Japanese people think of this phrase as a negative reply.<br/><br/>However, the result of another questionnaire survey suggests that "iketara iku" has different meanings depending on the region.<br/><br/>According to the survey, the phrase tends to be used when you don't want to go in the Kansai region (western Japan), whereas it tends to be used when you actually want to go in the Kanto region (eastern Japan).

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In the yesterday's post, you can find the Japanese word "oyazi" (親父), which means "father."<br/><br/>In Japan, there are several terms that mean "father," such as "otousan" (お父さん), "tousan" (父さん), "oyaji" (親父) and "papa" (パパ).<br/><br/>"Oyaji" comes from "oyachichi" (おやちち); here "oya" means "parent," and "chichi" means "father."<br/><br/>Also, although the original meaning of "oyaji" is "father," it sometimes implies an elderly man or a head of a group.<br/><br/>However, "oyaji" that isn't used to mean "father" often includes a contempt meaning.<br/><br/>For example, "oyaji gag" (親父ギャグ) means a stereotyped gag used by an older man.

When a fire or an accident occurs, many "yajiuma" (野次馬) will gather.<br/><br/>"Yajiuma" means people show interest in a incident unrelated to themselves and make a big deal about it.<br/><br/>It is said that "yajiuma" comes from "oyajiuma" (親父馬), here "oyaji" (親父) means "farther" and "uma" (馬) means "horse."<br/><br/>Because of this, "yajiuma" originally meant an old horse or an unmanageable horse.<br/><br/>Also, since such a horse is useless, "yajiuma" has come to mean people who are useless -- they just watch or make a big deal about an incident unrelated to themselves.

Have you ever thought that the sky was a blue ceiling?<br/><br/>In Japan, there is the term "ao tenjō" (青天井), the literal meaning of which is "a blue ceiling," and it implies the sky.<br/><br/>Also, "ao tenjō" is often used in business scenes.<br/><br/>The blue sky has an almost endless height, unlike ordinary ceilings.<br/><br/>Because of this, "ao tenjō" also means that there is no payment amount limits in transactions, or a market price of goods continues to rise for a long time.<br/><br/>Incidentally, if you say "ao tenjō" in the mah-jong field, it means a horrible rule that doesn't have a score limit.

I don't like a person who has a personality called "wagamama" (わがまま) very much.<br/><br/>"Wagamama" means that someone is selfish or acts spoiled.<br/><br/>Where the "waga" (わが) means "myself," and the "mama" (まま) means "as someone pleases."<br/><br/>Therefore, the literal meaning of "wagamama" is that you act just as you please without thinking other people -- that is, it implies a selfish character.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the character "mama" (ママ) can means just "mama" in English.<br/><br/>Because of this, you can make a pun something like "waga mama wa wagamama da" (わがママはわがままだ), which means "Me mother has a selfish character."<br/>(This is my original pun.)

In Japanese sentences, small hiragana syllabaries are sometimes written above or the side of kanji (Chinese characters).<br/><br/>This hiragana syllabaries are called "hurigana" (振り仮名), and is also called "rubi" (ルビ).<br/><br/>The etymology of "rubi" is just ruby, a kind of gemstones.<br/><br/>In British publishing industry, font sizes have given names of gemstones.<br/><br/>For example, Diamond is 4.5 points, Pearl is 5 points, Ruby is 5.5 points, and Emerald is 6.5 point.<br/><br/>In the Meiji period, the main font size on Japanese newspapers was 10.5 points, and the font size of hiragana syllabaries was 5.2 points.<br/><br/>Since the size was similar to the size called Ruby, we have come to use the term "rubi" (ルビ) to mean the hiragana (or katakana) syllabaries.

In Japan, today is in the midst of "aki" (秋) -- this day is called "shūbun" (秋分).<br/><br/>"Aki" is one of the seasons, and it's located between summer and winter, that is, "aki" is autumn.<br/><br/>There are three theories about the etymology of "aki."<br/><br/>The first one is that it comes from the fact that the sky color of this season is clear ("clear" is translated into Japanese as "akiraka" (明らか)).<br/><br/>The second one is that it comes from the fact that crops are abundant in this season (it's expressed "akimitsuru" (飽き満つる) in Japanese)..<br/><br/>The third one is that it comes from "aka" (紅) -- in this season, leaves begin to turn red ("red" is translated into Japanese as "akai" (紅い)).<br/><br/>Young Japanese people tend to like "aki" (autumn) the most among the four temperate seasons.

This month, I spent more money than my income.<br/><br/>We say "ashi ga deru" (足が出る) in such a case, which means that expenditure become higher than the budget or your income.<br/><br/>The "ashi" (足) means "leg," the "deru" (出る) means "to protrude," so the literal meaning of the composition is "a leg protrudes."<br/><br/>There are mainly two theories about the etymology of this term.<br/><br/>One is that the "ashi" (足 - leg) implies money.<br/><br/>In fact, since money runs around the world, mone is sometimes called "oashi" (here the "o" is a polite suffix) in Japan.<br/><br/>The other one is that it comes from the following fact;<br/>when making a kimono (traditional Japanese clothes), if you don't have enough textures due to lack of budget, your legs will protrude from the kimono.

<div class="date" hidden>Sep 21, 2017 16:53</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
When a child is born in Japan, it is commonly said that "ichihime nitaro" (一姫二太郎) is ideal.<br/><br/>Here "ichi" (一) means "first," "hime" (姫) means "daughter," "ni" (二) means "second," and "taro" (太郎) means "son."<br/><br/>Therefore, "ichihime nitaro" means that your first child is a daughter, and your second child is a son.<br/><br/>The reason why such a composition is regarded as an ideal one is because it's easier to foster a daughter than a son, and she will help with house work and child care after growing somewhat.<br/><br/>Previously, this term is used as a word of comfort when a daughter was born first even if the parents wanted a son.<br/><br/>However, these days many Japanese people think that "ichihime nitaro" is actually ideal due to various reasons.

Yesterday, I introduced "mayoler" (マヨラー), which means mayonnaise lovers, and "kechaler" (ケチャラー), which means ketchup lovers.<br/><br/>There is another slang term, "kuchaler" (クチャラー), the sound of which is similar to "kechaler."<br/><br/>If you chew something without closing your mouth, the chewing sound will be heard by others.<br/><br/>In Japan, this sound is represented by an onomatopoeia, "kucha kucha" (くちゃくちゃ).<br/><br/>Because of this, people who eat something while opening the mouth and making the sound have come to be called "kuchaler."<br/><br/>Almost all kuchalers don't seem to be aware of the chewing sound, but it can make many people unpleasant, so please be careful not to be a kuchaler.

Do you like mayonnaise?<br/><br/>In Japan, people who love mayonnaise and eat various dishes with a lot of mayonnaise are called "mayoler."<br/><br/>The "ler" of "mayoler" comes from the English suffix "-er," which is used in forming nouns designating persons.<br/><br/>Some mayolers seem to suck or drink mayonnaise.<br/><br/>According to the theory of a Japanese scholar, the reason why mayolers are born is because a intracerebral narcotic substance called β-endorphin is produced by a large amount of fat contained in mayonnaise.<br/><br/>Incidentally, people who love ketchup are called "kechaler" (ケチャラー) in Japan.<br/><br/>Note that both "mayoler" and "kechaler" are slang terms.

Previously, I introduced the Japanese phrase, "tsuki to suppon" (月とスッポン), which means that two things are very different from each other, though they have something in common.<br/><br/>Today, I will talk about the "suppon" (スッポン) of "tsuki to suppon."<br/><br/>"Suppon" means a soft-shell turtle, and is widely distributed in China, Japan, Russia and etc.<br/><br/>Especially in Japan and China, people have eaten suppons since a long time ago.<br/>In Japan, the word "suppon" has been used since the Edo period, but before that it had been called "dorogame" (ドロガメ), the literal meaning of which is "mud turtle."<br/><br/>The etymology of "suppon" hasn't been clarified yet, but it's said that it comes from an onomatopoeia when a suppon makes a plunge into a river.

Yesterday, I introduced the Japanese term "warikan" (割り勘), which means that after you had a meal with several people, everyone pays the same amount or each person pays for their own meal.<br/><br/>"Warukan" is very common in Japan, but there are many countries that such a payment style hasn't penetrated.<br/><br/>In English, you can say "Dutch treat" or "Going Dutch" to mean "warikan."<br/><br/>It is said that such phrases come from the fact that British people tried to fix a stingy image to Dutch people in the Age of Exploration.<br/><br/>Also, "splitting the bill" is a more general English phrase to mean "warikan."<br/><br/>Since this post will be a little long, I'd like to talk about the the remaining part (phrases to mean "warikan" in other countries) tomorrow.

When you have a meal with several people, especially share the dish on a large platter, the payment will usually become "warikan" (割り勘).<br/><br/>"Warikan" means that everyone who had meals together pays the same amount, which is the total cost of the meal divided by the number of people.<br/><br/>The word "warikan" is short for "warimae kanjō" (割り前勘定), here the "warimae" (割り前) means "amount to be allocated," and the "kanjō" (勘定) menas "to pay for something."<br/><br/>From a global viewpoint, it seems that there are many cases where one representative pays the full amount.<br/><br/>I heard that some countries don't have a word directly referring to "warikan," and some countries don't have the concept of "warikan."<br/><br/>Tomorrow I'd like to introduce the way of thinking and expressing for "warikan" in some countries.

Since the number of my entries, 1000, is a round figure, I rewrote my self-introduction a bit as follows. Note that there are many overlapping parts.<br/><br/>------------------------------------<br/><br/>Hi, I'm a teacher at a university in Tokyo, Japan. I'm engaged in some studies related to non-destructive inspection/diagnosis in X-ray CT imaging. On this Lang-8, I've written about a Japanese idiom, Japanese culture or a trivial matter every day. I hope these posts will be useful for foreigners who learn Japanese.<br/><br/>Please feel free to send a friend request. :)<br/><br/>[ Hobby ]<br/>My hobbies are watching American dramas, solving math and programming problems and riding my road bike. I think that I've watched a lot of American dramas, for example, Friends, Dr. House, Numbers, Ugly Betty, Breaking Bad, Person of Interest, Suits, Lie to Me, FLASH, The Big Bang Theory, The Mentalist, Modern Family, and so on (sometimes UK dramas like SHERLOCK are included). If there is a drama that you can recommend, I want you to tell me.<br/><br/>[ Dream ]<br/>My dream is to study in a university in the US and to become a professor of a university.<br/>

Today the number of my posts on Lang-8 finally reached 1000.<br/><br/>Since I tend to slack off or goof off my work, it was really hard for me to continue writing articles every day.<br/><br/>Also, today I was received a letter of appointment -- it means that I officially promoted to assistant professor on September 1, 2017.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the day, September 1, 2017 was my 30th birthday.<br/><br/>Furthermore, on that day, the domain of my personal homepage expired.<br/><br/>The day was an unusual day when various events overlapped. <br/><br/>Next, I will do my best to post 2000 entries and become an associate professor.

Recently, I bought some expensive devices and items for my study.<br/>(I once paid the expense, and it will be returned to me as a study spending after about two months.)<br/><br/>Because of this, unfortunately I am about to "okera ni naru."<br/><br/>"Okera ni naru" means to lose almost all your money.<br/><br/>"Okera" (おけら) is a common name for "kera" (ケラ), which means "Gryllotalpa orientalis," and "ninaru" means "to become something."<br/><br/>The view of the Gryllotalpa orientalis from the anterior looks like as if it's rasing the both hands.<br/><br/>Also, the gesture rasing both hands means that he/she can't do anything or is distressed.<br/><br/>Therefore, "okera ni naru," the literal meaning of which is "becoming Gryllotalpa orientalis," has come to have the current meaning.

<div class="date" hidden>Sep 10, 2017 12:43</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I wrote about a bug that you can't see posts on Lang-8.<br/><br/>After that, I received some comments and messages about the solution to the bug.<br/><br/>According to the messages, when you post your entry, if you set the access settings to "Share with all Lang-8 users" or "Share with My Friends only" (not "Public"), such a problem will be eliminated.<br/>(The bug would also be solved if you set it to "Privat - Just Me," but there is almost no meaning to post on Lang-8 in the setting.)<br/><br/>I really appreciate the information.<br/><br/>I'd like to share it on this post as well.<br/><br/>However, since it does not a fundamental solution, I hope that this site will be modified in the near future.

Recently I can't see my posts on Lang-8.<br/><br/>I tried to see them with various web browsers, such as Chrome, FireFox, Safari, and EDGE,  and re-login several times, but the results were the same.<br/><br/>I have no idea about the cause, but other Lang-8 users seem to be unable to see my posts as well.<br/><br/>Only when I used a smartphone, I could browse them.<br/><br/>I'm very sad.<br/><br/>This post is containing a test.<br/><br/>I think that if I write sentences without my native language (Japanese), such a sad bug may be removed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have a feeling that it won't work.<br/><br/>If you have any solution, please let me know it.

Yesterday, I introduced the Japanese phrase, "undei no sa," which means a very big difference.<br/><br/>In Japanese, there is another phrase, "tsuki to suppon" (月とスッポン), which has the similar meaning of it.<br/><br/>Here, "tsuki" (月) means "moon," "to" (と) means "and," and "スッポン" means "soft-shell turtle."<br/><br/>Both the full moon and a shell of a soft-shell turtle are round.<br/><br/>However, in Japan, the moon is a symbol of beauty, whereas it's said that the soft-shell turtle lives in dirty and has ugly face.<br/><br/>Because of this, "tsuki to suppon" has come to mean something two that are very different from each other, though they have one thing in common.

You will feel "undei no sa" (雲泥の差) for various things, as long as you live a life.<br/><br/>"Undei no sa" means a very big difference or a huge gap of something.<br/><br/>The "un" (雲) means "cloud," the "deo" (泥) means "dirt," the "sa" (差) means "difference," so the literal meaning of the combination is "differences between cloud and dirt."<br/><br/>Here the cloud implies the sky, and the dirt implies the ground.<br/><br/>That is to say, the phrase "undei no sa" represents a big difference/gap, like the distance between the sky and the ground.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
These days, since I eat meals until I become a state called "tarafuku" (たらふく), I am getting a little bit fat.<br/><br/>"Tarafuku" is a word that represents a state that you can't eat any more due to a feeling of fullness, or an act of eating or drinking a lot.<br/><br/>"Tarafuku" is written as "鱈腹" in Kanji, where the "鱈" (tara) means "cod/codfish," and the "腹" (fuku) means "stomach."<br/><br/>In fact, the stomach of cod is swollen, but this kanji is a kind of phonetic equivalents, and the etymology of "tarafuku" isn't related to cod.<br/><br/>The actual etymology is more simple -- the adverbial suffix "ku" (く) has been added to the verb "tarafu" (足らふ), which means that something is enough.<br/><br/>In Japan, it's generally said that eating moderately is better than eating until "tarafuku."

If you want to say that a thing or a person is in danger, or it is about to disappear, you can use the phrase, "hūzen no yomoshibi" (風前の灯火) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "hūzen" (風前) means "front of wind," that is to say, "a windy place."<br/><br/>The "tomoshibi" (灯火) means a light with fire, such as a flaring candle, in a literal sense.<br/><br/>If there is a flaring candle in a windy place, obviously the fire will be about to go out, so this phrase has come to have the current meaning.<br/><br/>It seems to be similar to the English phrase, "hang by a thread."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
It is very important to be "shinsetsu" (親切).<br/><br/>"Shinsetsu" is a word that represents kindness and compassion toward other people.<br/><br/>Generally, the "shin" (親) means "parents," the "setsu" means "cut," but it doesn't mean to cut parents.<br/><br/>The kanji "親" (shin) means not only "parents," but also "being familiar."<br/><br/>Also, the kanji "切" (setsu) can mean to fit well or reach, because if you want to cut something using a knife or something, the knife will touch the object.<br/><br/>That is to say, "shinsetsu" implies that you become familiar with someone and reach his/her heart.

Have you ever give assistance to someone in earnest?<br/><br/>Such an act is called "hitohada nugu" (一肌脱ぐ) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "hito" (一) means "one," "hada" (肌) means "skin," and "nugu" (脱ぐ) means "to take off clothes/something."<br/><br/>In the past, Japanese people wear kimonos that have wide sleeves.<br/><br/>Also, when they did something in earnest, they took off one the kimono from one side of the shoulder, in order not to be disturbed by the sleeve of the kimono.<br/><br/>Because of this fact, "hitohada nugu" has come to be used the current meaning.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I often do "kai ni naru" (貝になる).<br/><br/>The "kai" (貝) means "shellfish," the "naru" (なる) means "become/be," so the literal meaning of "kai ni naru" is to become a shellfish.<br/><br/>Since shellfishes close their shells tightly, it's hard to open them.<br/><br/>Because of this, "kai ni naru" (becoming a shellfish) has come to mean to close your mouth and say nothing, just like a shellfish.<br/><br/>Incidentally, there is the Japanese movie and drama, titled "watashi ha kai ni naritai" (私は貝になりたい - I'd Rather Be a Shellfish).<br/><br/>I haven't watched them, but according to the Internet, the title "kai ni naritai" just literally means to want to be a shellfish living at the bottom of the sea.

We usually use "second," "minute" and "hour" as units of time, and this fact is worldwide.<br/><br/>Apart from such general units in the world, Japanese people sometimes use "setsuna" (刹那) when expressing just a moment.<br/><br/>"Setsuna" is one of the concepts of time in Buddhism, and it refers to an extremely short time.<br/><br/>There are several detailed definitions -- one of most famous definitions is that the moment of flicking your fingers is equal to 65 setsuna.<br/><br/>Also, in countries that use the Chinese writing system, setsuna is used as a numerical unit that represents 10 to the power of -18.

Have you ever gotten angry because things didn't go well as you expected?<br/><br/>Getting angry like this is called "gou wo niyasu" (業を煮やす) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The word "gou" (業) of "gou wo niyasu" is a Buddhism term, meaning an act by the body, the mouth, or the mind (it especially means an act by the mind here).<br/><br/>Also, the literal meaning of "niyasu" (煮やす) means to boil something, but since the act heats something using fire, it can also mean to strengthen feelings or emotions.<br/><br/>Therefore, "gou wo niyasu" means to get angry/irritated, and the feeling is strengthened.

<div class="date" hidden>Aug 26, 2017 13:46</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are several premature laws in Japan.<br/><br/>Today I would like to talk about two interesting laws among them.<br/><br/>The first one is established in 1966, and is related to activities on the Moon and asteroids.<br/><br/>According to this law, we are prohibited from conducting military exercises on the moon and asteroids, and all facilities there have to be released to all astronauts in other countries.<br/><br/>The second one is established in 2000, and is related to cloning technology.<br/><br/>According to this law, a person who made a cloned human will be imprisoned for 10 years.<br/><br/>As of today, there are no cases that these laws were applied.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Recently, I watched the animated movie, "Sing."<br/><br/>When I watched it repeatedly on Blu-ray, I found that Johnny and his father said "Oi" several times.<br/><br/>One of these scenes can be confirmed in around 40 seconds of the following video (spoiler alert).<br/><br/><object height="315" width="560">
<param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/pHZneOidj9A"/>
<embed height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/pHZneOidj9A" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560"/>
</object>
<br/><br/>It's written as "Boy" in the Youtube subtitles, but it's written as "Oi" in the Blu-ray subtitles.<br/><br/>"Oi" is a British slang term, and is used as an interjection to catch someone's attention.<br/><br/>Interestingly, "Oi" (おい) is also used in Japan as the almost same meaning.<br/><br/>However, note that "Oi" in Japan is an expression used by men that sounded a little rude.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I introduced the Japanese idiom, "chacha wo ireru" (茶々を入れる), which means to tease someone by saying something unnecessary.<br/><br/>There is another Japanese verb, "hiyakasu" (冷やかす), which has the similar meaning to "chacha wo ireru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "hiyakasu" is just cooling something down, but it's usually used to mean to tease someone, or criticize goods without having the intention of buying.<br/><br/>It is said that this meaning comes from the fact that paper craftsmen in Asakusa brought prostitutes in Yoshiwara into ridicule during cooling paper materials down.

Have you ever broken into a conversation of others, and said unnecessary things or cracks?<br/><br/>Such an act is called "chacha wo ireru" (茶々を入れる) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "chacha" (茶々) contains the kanji, "茶," which means "tea," but this idiom doesn't related to tea.<br/>(Incidentally, the kanji "々" means repetition the previous character.)<br/><br/>One of the most accepted theories about its etymology is that it's comes from "jaja" (邪邪).<br/><br/>"Jaja" meant to disturb someone or act spoiled, and the theory states that "jaja" has changed into "chacha."<br/>("Jaja" is no longer used.)

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
If you do or say something irresponsible with no basis, you will be told "atezuppou" (当てずっぽう) in Japanese.<br/><br/>"Atezuppou" means something like random guess, and it's used like "Atezuppou na koto wo iuna" (当てずっぽうなことを言うな - Don't say atezuppo things.)<br/><br/>The most acceptable theory about its etymology is that it comes from the term "ate zuiryou" (当て推量), which has come to be used since the Edo period.<br/><br/>Here "ate" (当て) means "prospect," and "zuiryou/suiryou" (推量) means "guess."<br/><br/>The theory says that "ate zuiryou" became "atezui" for short, and it became "atezuibou" by personifying ("bou" is a suffix word that is sometimes added to boys' names), and finally it became "atezuppou."

Today I'd like to talk about the Japanese idiom, "kuda wo maku" (管を巻く).<br/><br/>Here, the "kuda" (管) means a small spindle that is used in fiber spinning, and "maku" (巻く) means to wind something.<br/><br/>In fiber spinning, in order to make thread, fiber is wound to the kuda (spindle) by rotating the spinning wheel.<br/><br/>This act is called "kudamaki" (管巻き) or "kuda wo maku" (管を巻く).<br/><br/>The act called "kuda wo maku" and the sound from it are very monotonous, and it's similar to a drunk person who talks same things monotonously.<br/><br/>Because of this, "kuda wo maku" has come to mean that a drunk person talks nonsensical things monotonously and repeatedly.

Some people embellish a story using something that's not true.<br/><br/>Such an act is called "ohire wo tsukeru" (尾ひれを付ける) in Japan.<br/><br/>The "ohire" means a tail and a fin of fish, and the "tsukeru" means to attach, so the literal meaning of it is "attaching a tail and a fin."<br/><br/>If you add a tail and a fin to fish, its look will be flashy.<br/><br/>However, since the number of tails and fins of fish is determined, of course such fish doesn't exist.<br/><br/>Because of this, people have come to say "ohire wo tsukeru" to mean to embellish/exaggerate a story by adding lie  information.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Day before yesterday, I stayed at a resort hotel called "Hotel Urashima" (ホテル浦島).<br/><br/>The name of this hotel comes from the famous Japanese fairy tale, "Urashima Tarō."<br/><br/>The outline of "Urashima Tarō" is something like the following.<br/><br/>A fisherman called Urashima Tarō, found a turtle that is being tormented by children, and rescued it.<br/><br/>In order to express gratitude, the turtle put Tarō on the back, and invited him to Ryūgū-jō  (竜宮城 - Dragon Palace) in the sea.<br/><br/>In Ryūgū-jō, Tarō was welcomed by the beautiful princess, Otohime (乙姫), and he enjoyed fish dancing and gorgeous food.<br/><br/>To be continued later.

From yesterday to today, my relatives, my family and I have gone to a trip.<br/><br/>Although it was tough to treat my nephew and my niece on the car, it was also fun. <br/><br/>The hotel was located between the mountain and the sea, and the hot spring was in the cave.<br/><br/>Since you could see the expanse sea from the hot spring in the cave, we could totally feel the enormous nature.<br/><br/>However, somehow I couldn't sleep well yesterday (probably it was due to the unfamiliar environment.).<br/><br/>Today we went to LEGOLAND Japan, played there, and came back to home.<br/><br/>I'm quite exhausted now.

Yesterday, I introduced the Japanese word, "sanshita" (三下), which means  a lower-level member of an organization.<br/><br/>Today I'd like to talk about the word, "zako" (雑魚), which is used as the similar meaning of "sanshita."<br/><br/>Originally "zako" is a word to call all small fish with low commercial value.<br/><br/>By extension, it has come to mean low-level or weak people.<br/><br/>Recent young people tend to use "zako" rather than "sanshita."<br/><br/>Incidentally, "zako" is often used in manga and anime.<br/><br/>Since both "sanshita" and "zako" contain derogatory meanings, please be careful when you use them.

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese word "sanshita" (三下), which means a lower-level member of an organization.<br/><br/>Here the "san" (三) means "three," and the "shita" (下) means "under," so the literal meaning of "sanshita" is just "under three."<br/><br/>Originally, "sanshita" was used to mean a lower-level person among gamblers.<br/><br/>In Japanese gambling using dice, one and two (under three) were weak, so losers have come to be called "sanshita."<br/><br/>From this, lower-level people/small fry have come to be called "sanshita" even outside the field of gambling.<br/><br/>I work at a university, but I have the least experience among teachers, that is, I'm a sanshita.

Yesterday, I introduced the Japanese phrase, "me ga takai" (目が高い), the literal meaning of which is "one's eyes are high," and it means that someone has the ability to choose superior things or people.<br/><br/>There are another Japanese idiom, "zu ga takai" (頭が高い), the literal meaning of which is similar to "me ga takai."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "zu ga takai" is "one's head is high," but the actual meaning is quite different from "me ga takai."<br/><br/>"Zu ga takai" means an attitude looking down someone or being rude.<br/><br/>In Japan, there is a custom that people lower their heads to higher ranking people, and "zu ga takai" implies that he/she doesn't lower his/her head.

There is the Japanese idiom, "me ga takai" (目が高い).<br/><br/>The "me" means "eye," and the "takai" means "high," so the literal meaning of "me ga takai" is "one's eyes are high."<br/><br/>Can you imagine what this idiom actually means?<br/><br/>The answer is that someone has an ability to choose superior things or people.<br/><br/>The etymology is simple -- it's because you can see things well if your eyes would be placed at a high position.<br/><br/>Incidentally, there is fish called "medaka" (メダカ/目高 - killifish) in Japan, and its name comes from the fact that killfish's eyes are high, but it's not related to this idiom.

The other day, I wrote that most Japanese idioms about "hara" (腹 - stomach) is related to "kokoro" (心 - heart).<br/><br/>For example, there is the idiom "hara ga kuroi / haraguro" (腹が黒い / 腹黒), the literal meaning of which is "one's stomach is black," and it means people who have bad heart.<br/><br/>Some say that this idiom comes from the fact that halfbeak has black stomach, but I think that the black stomach of halfbeak don't related to a bad heart.<br/><br/>Also, there is another theory that it comes from the Japanese myth -- the bad God called "izanami" has black thunder around his belly.<br/><br/>However, in my opinion, it just comes from the fact that stomachs and hearts have close relationship in Japan.

Recently I often become a state of "utatane" (うたた寝).<br/><br/>"Utatane" means to be about to fall asleep even if you don't want to do so.<br/><br/>The "ne" (寝) of "utatane" means to sleep, but actually, the etymology of the "utata" have yet to be revealed.<br/><br/>Since the "utata" (うたた) can be used as an adverb that means that something progresses steadily and becomes deadly, a theory insists that the "utata" of "utatane" comes from this adverb, and implies that drowsiness progresses.<br/><br/>Another theory insists that the "utata" comes from the onomatopoeia "uto uto," which represents that someone is sleepy.

Do you have a friend or a follower to whom you can talk about your any problem or thought?<br/><br/>Trusting someone deeply like this, or just such a man, is called "fukushin" (腹心) in Japan.<br/> <br/>Originally, "fukushin" means literally "stomach and heart" (the "fuku" means "stomach" and the "shin" means "heart"), and it also means "deep inside of one's mind."<br/><br/>Furthermore, it has come to mean that you can trust enough to talk about your heart of hearts, and such trustworthy person.<br/><br/>There are many idioms/terms related to "hara/fuku" (腹 - stomach) in Japan, but most of them are related to "heart/mind."

"Mizu" (水) means "water," and "kashi/gashi" (菓子) means "sweets" or "snacks."<br/><br/>What do you think is the meaning of "mizugashi" (水菓子), which is made by the two words, "mizu" and "kashi."<br/><br/>Actually, "mizugashi" means "fruits."<br/><br/>In the past, all light foods such as fruits were called "kashi."<br/><br/>Among them, especially succulent fruits such as watermelons or pears has come to be called "mizugashi."<br/><br/>Nowadays, since the word "kudamono" (果物) is mainly used to refer to fruits, the number of Japanese people who think of "mizugashi" as "sweets that contains a lot of water" (such as jelly dessert) is increasing.<br/>(Sweets that contains a lot of water are formally called "namagashi" (生菓子), the literal meaning of which is "fresh/unbaked sweets.")<br/><br/>In fact, even if you search for "mizugashi" on Google Images, it's hard to find fruits.

Recently I have come to drink a lot of carbonated water.<br/><br/>Carbonated water, which you might call it sparkling water, is water containing carbon dioxide gas.<br/><br/>The reason why I drink carbonated water is because I want to feel something like coolness.<br/><br/>According to the Internet, there are several advantages and disadvantages about carbonated water.<br/><br/>As the advantages, it can promote blood flow and recover fatigue.<br/><br/>As disadvantages, if you drink it too much, you may feel tired and your body may become swollen.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether these information is true or false, but indeed I've felt tired recently.

Last week, I bought Microsoft HoloLens by using my research expense.<br/><br/>HoloLens is a head mounted display for MR (Mixed Reality).<br/><br/>Here, MR is a technology to show a new real world in which digital contents are embedded in real time.<br/><br/>You can also say that MR is a technology made by evolving AR (Argmented Reality), which is used in applications such as "Pokémon GO."<br/><br/>For example, since MR considers distances to real objects, virtual objects placed behind obstacles such as a desk would not be displayed on the HoloLens.<br/><br/>It is a very interesting technology, but I feel that it takes some time to get used to use it.

I think that there are various parting greetings in many countries.<br/><br/>The most common one in Japan is "sayōnara" (さようなら - goodbye), but we often say "ogenki de" (お元気で) or "otassha de" (お達者で) for a person who will not meet with us for a long time.<br/><br/>Here, "genki" means that your body condition is good, and "tassha" means that your body is strong.<br/><br/>That is to say, both "ogenki de" and "otassha de" are a phrase that is used to wish for someone's health.<br/>(The "de" here means something like "please be ...")<br/><br/>I like the phrase "otassha de," but nowadays, it's rarely used by young people.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday I wrote about a drinking party.<br/><br/>In Japanese drinking spots or Japanese-style bars, we often order "ohiya" (お冷) at the end of the party.<br/><br/>"Ohiya" is composed of the polite prefix "o" (お) and the "hiya" (冷や), meaning "cold," and it usually refers to "cold water."<br/><br/>It was once called as "ohiyashi" (お冷やし), and as used as a polite term that means "mizu" (水 - water) by women in the imperial court. <br/><br/>After the Edo period, it has come to be used regardless of gender, and now it's often used in Japanese-style bars/pubs.<br/><br/>Note that if you omit the prefix "o" and just say "hiya," it will mean cold/room-temperature Japanese sake.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, my colleagues and I conducted "shoki barai" (暑気払い).<br/><br/>"Shoki" of "shoki barai" means "heat," and "harai" means to take something off.<br/><br/>Therefore, "shoki barai" literally refers to taking heat that is accumulated in our bodies off by drinking cold drinks or eating cold food in the hot summer.<br/><br/>However, if you say "shoki barai" in our time, it usually means just a banquet or a drinking party that is held for beating the heat, reducing stress, and relieving fatigue.<br/><br/>As far as I know, beer garden etc. are often planned as the "shoki barai."

Yesterday, I introduced "yodare" (よだれ), which means saliva dribbling unconsciously from a mouth.<br/><br/>If you want to mention about just saliva in Japanese, you can use the word "daeki" (唾液), but "tsuba" (つば) is often used as a spoken language.<br/><br/>"Tsuba" is a term omitted "ki" from "tsubaki."<br/><br/>"Tsubaki" was originally "tsuhaki" -- "tsu" means "saliva," and "haki" means to spit something.<br/><br/>From this etymology, "tsuba" often refers to saliva spit out from a mouth.<br/><br/>I'm sorry for posting the dirty topic for the second successive day.<br/><br/>Incidentally, now "tsubaki" usually means Camellia that blooms in winter.

Today, I found a student who was sleeping while dribbling "yodare" (よだれ).<br/><br/>"Yodare" means saliva dribbling unconsciously from a mouth.<br/><br/>This term was called "yodari" (よだり) or "yotari" (よたり) until the Heian period.<br/><br/>Here, "tari" is a noun form of the verb "taru" (垂る), which means to dribble.<br/><br/>There are several theories about the etymology of "yo" -- one of them is that it comes from "yoyomu," which means to become an old person.<br/><br/>Incidentally, if you say "yodare wo tarasu" (よだれを垂らす - dribbling yodare), it could literally mean to dribble saliva, but it also used as a phrase that means to have a hunger to eat/do something.

In most cases, people don't like a person who often blame or tell a joke about someone's minor mistake or fluff.<br/><br/>Such an action is called "ageashi wo toru" (揚げ足を取る) or "ageashi tori" (揚げ足取り) in Japan.<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "ageashi wo toru" is "picking a raised foot up."<br/><br/>Here, "ageashi," which was translated into "a raised foot," refers to a foot when attacking an opponent in judo or sumo.<br/><br/>If you pick someone's raised foot up, you can defeat him/her, so "ageashi wo toru" has come to the current meaning.

Recently I might have become a little bit "debu" (でぶ),<br/><br/>"Debu" is a slang term that refers to a fat person or animal, and is often used as an ironic expression.<br/><br/>The most accepted theory about its etymology is that the onomatopoeia, "deppuri" (でっぷり), which means fat, chenged to "debu debu" (でぶでぶ), and finally became "debu."<br/><br/>There are other theories, for example, one of them is that "double chin" changed to "debu chin" (でぶちん), then changed to "debu." <br/><br/>Please be careful not to say "debu" to other people inconsiderately.

Have you ever taken an adventurous action towards a purpose?<br/><br/>Such an action is called "gamushara" (がむしゃら) in Japan.<br/><br/>This term is composed of "gamusha" (がむしゃ) and the suffix "ra" (ら).<br/><br/>"Gamusha" is written as "我武者" in kanji, and its literal meaning is "self-assertive samurai," so this is often thought as the etymology of "gamushara."<br/><br/>Besides, there are several theories about the etymology of "gamushara," for example, it comes from "gamusho," which means to feel an irresistible desire to do something, or "musha kusha," which is a onomatopoeia that refers to something uncomfortable and restless.

In the northern hemisphere, "natsu" (夏) has approached.<br/><br/>"Natsu" is a kind of seasons, and it can be translated as summer in English.<br/><br/>Astronomically "natsu" is defined the period between the summer solstice and the autumn equinox, but in Japan, it usually means three months -- June, July and August.<br/><br/>There are several theories about the etymology of "natsu," such as that is comes from "atsui" (暑い - hot) or "netsu" (熱 - heat), but the truth remains to be identified.<br/><br/>Needless to say, natsu (summer) is the season when people become the most active in the year for many countries.<br/><br/>In Japan, various events like summer festivals and fireworks festivals will be held.

Today, a mid-term graduation research presentation (poster presentation) of senior students was held in my university.<br/><br/>I was very busy because I had to prepare and manage the venue, collect and arrange Fast Forward (1 minute presentations for posters), and go out for giving a class several times.<br/><br/>Yesterday, I was working until midnight, and finally stayed at my university.<br/><br/>It was a very difficult day, but the presentation went very well, so I'm satisfied.<br/><br/>However, although there were many interesting posters, I could check only some of them because of my class.<br/><br/>I have a regret only about that.

Have you ever received no reply/response after you give a letter or try to make contact?<br/><br/>If you don't get any response like this situation, it is called "nashi no tsubute" (梨の礫) in Japan.<br/><br/>"Tsubute" of "nashi no tsubute" means a pebble that is mainly used as throwing weapon.<br/><br/>Since thrown pebbles (tsubute) never come back to your hand, getting no reply has come to be called "nashi no tsubute."<br/><br/>"Nashi" of "nashi no tsubute" use the kanji, "梨," which means a kind of fruits, "Pyrus pyrifolia," but it just a metaphor for "nashi" (無し), which means nothing.

I am in a little bad economic situation now.<br/><br/>If your household economy becomes extremely terrible, the situation will be called "hi no kuruma" (火の車).<br/><br/>"Hi" (火) means "fire," and "kuruma" (車) means "car," so "hi no kuruma" means a burning car.<br/><br/>Also, "hi no kuruma" (火の車) comes from "kasya" (火車), which is a Buddhist term.<br/><br/>"Kasya" also means a burning car, and it is used when Gokusotsu (prison guard) ogres in hell carry a dead person who committed a crime.<br/><br/>Since criminals put in the burning car would suffer terribly, "hi no kuruma" has come to mean a difficult economic situation.

I bought a Costco's new cake, "Strawberry Trifle" yesterday.<br/><br/>Since cakes are "ashi ga hayai" (足が早い), I have to eat all of them by tomorrow.<br/><br/>Here, the literal meaning of "ashi ga hayai" is that something's legs are quick, and it means that food or something is spoil quickly.<br/><br/>"Ashi" (legs/feet) could represent changes in movements or states of things, and perishable things change quickly (hayai - 早い), so they have come to be called "ashi ga hayai."<br/><br/>Also, based on the same etymology, "ashi ga hayai" can mean that a product or something sells fairly well.

Since yesterday was a deadline for a speech manuscript at an academic conference, I did "tetuya" (徹夜).<br/><br/>"Tetsuya" means to do activities such as work or entertainment all through the night without sleep.<br/><br/>"Tetsu" (徹) of "tetsuya" means to go/become through, and "ya" (夜) means night.<br/><br/>Therefore, "tetsuya" means to stay awake through the night.<br/><br/>If work goes well by doing tetsuya, you can receive a sense of accomplishment, but you will increase mistakes due to a lack of concentration, and you will be in bad physical condition, you should avoid doing tetsuya as much as possible.<br/><br/>Incidentally, young people often say "all" (ォール) instead of tetsuya.<br/><br/>"All" is short for "all night," and it is used as "All suru" (オールする - do all).

A Japanese publishing company named "Sanseidō," which is known for publishing dictionaries, announces "Kotoshi no Shingo" (New Words of the Year) every year.<br/><br/>Today, I learned the new term "emoi" (エモい), which was selected as the second most important word on the Kotoshi no Shingo 2016.<br/><br/>"Emoi" is an adjective that represents something passionate or emotional, and is mainly used by young people and music lovers.<br/><br/>As you would guess, "emoi" comes from the English word "emotion."<br/><br/>"Emoi" was born by shortening "emotion" and adding the suffix, "i," which can change a noun to an adjective.<br/><br/>Incidentally, "emoi" was also used around 2000 by mainly young women, but it was short for "eroi kimoi," which means "dirty and gross."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Now I'm in a situation of "noppiki naranai" (のっぴきならない).<br/><br/>"Noppiki naranai" is a term that represents that you can't run away or avoid something -- you are in a pinch.<br/><br/>"Noppiki" (のっぴき) comes from "noki hiki" (退き引き), which means to pull back and avoid something.<br/><br/>By adding the negative word, "naranai" (ならない), it has come to the current meaning.<br/><br/>Please note that "noppiki" is always used with "naranai."<br/><br/>Even in a situation of "noppiki naranai," I don't want to stop posting on Lang-8.<br/><br/>Incidentally, this term is similar to "seppa tsumaru" (切羽詰まる), which is introduced on the following URL:<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/169229349258527539552022635198685499088" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/169229349258527539552022635198685499088</a>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Japanese people sometimes say "koke ni suru" (コケにする) when taunting someone.<br/><br/>Here, "koke" is written as "虚仮" in kanji, which is not "苔" meaning "moss."<br/><br/>"Koke" (虚仮) is a Buddhist term, and means that something is empty/insubstantial, or a mind/act is fake.<br/><br/>That's why "koke ni suru" (making someone be koke) has come to be used as a term for mocking people.<br/><br/>There is another term, "koke odoshi" (虚仮威し), which use the same "koke."<br/><br/>"Odoshi" means to bluff, and "koke odoshi" means something that has good appearance but is empty.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A kiseru is a kind of smoking tools in Japan, and its structure and form are similar to pipes.<br/><br/>General pipes are made of metals (except bowls), whereas kiserus use metals only for mouthpiece parts and bowls, and use bamboo for other parts.<br/><br/>Therefore, you can suck on the kiseru about only three times after you light it.<br/><br/>The term, "kiseru," can also mean an act of cheating on a train fare.<br/><br/>This is derived from kiseru's structure -- there are metals only on the entrance and the exit.<br/>(In Japan, 金 of 金属 (which means metals) can imply money.)<br/><br/>Incidentally, it's thought that the word "kiseru" comes from "ksher," which means pipe in Cambodian language.

Today was a holiday, so I went to Nagano Prefecture with my friends.<br/>(We really love Nagano.)<br/><br/>Originally, we planned to climb a mountain, but we changed to go to Narai-juku because of the bad weather.<br/><br/>Narai-juku is an inn town that has flourished with a lot of travelers, and traditional Japanese buildings and houses still remain there as Groups of Traditional Buildings.<br/><br/>Since there are many shops that sell traditional things, such as woodworks, lacquerware and local foods, we could enjoy a lot.<br/><br/>After that, we went to "Tateshina Amusement Suizokukan," which is a aquarium located in the highest attitude in the world.<br/><br/>It was relatively small aquarium with only freshwater fish, but it was interesting because there were a lot of unusual fish.<br/><br/>It was a fulfilling day, however I got caught in a terrible traffic jam on my way home, I was really exhausted.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
"Kaminari" (雷) is a natural phenomenon that generates light and sound due to discharge in the air, and is often translated as "thunder."<br/><br/>The etymology of "kaminari" is simple -- it comes from "kami no narasu oto" (神の鳴らす音), the literal meaning of which is "the sound rung by God."<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is another word "inazuma" (稲妻), which has the same meaning of "kaminari," though "inazuma" is often translated into "lightning." <br/><br/>The "ina" (稲) of "inazuma" means "rice," and "zuma/tsuma" (妻) means "husband" here. <br/>(Note that "tsuma" means "wife" now, but once it could mean both "wife" and "husband.")<br/><br/>Thunder/lightning often occurs from summer to autumn, which is when rice grows.<br/><br/>Because of this, it was thought that lightning is a husband of rice (ine/ina no tsuma/zuma), and we have come to call lightning "inazuma."

Japanese people often refers to other's wife as "oku-san" (奥さん).<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "oku" (奥) is a deep inside of something, or a place that is far from the entrance.<br/><br/>Because of this, it has come to mean a room far from the entrance, furthermore, a person (woman) living there.<br/><br/>"San" of "oku-san" is a polite suffix that is often added to a person's name.<br/><br/>If you want to express it more polite, you can say "oku-sama" (奥様) by adding "sama" (様) instead of "san."<br/><br/>This word comes from the fact that people considered that women should be in a room that is far from the entrance.<br/><br/>However, note that "oku" (奥) is not a word that put women down.<br/><br/>In fact, the adjective "okuyukashii" (奥ゆかしい), which uses "oku," is a praise term for almost all Japanese women.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Young people tend to do something indiscriminate or thoughtless.<br/><br/>Such behavior of youths is called "wakage no itari" (若気の至り) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Here "wakage" (若気) means "youth," and "itari" (至り) means "course/result of something."<br/><br/>Therefore, "wakage no itari" is a term that suggests the fact something like that immature young people tend to do something indiscriminate as a result of letting matters take their course.<br/><br/>This term is often used when a youth want to consider his/her failure to be due to youth or someone want to protect youth's failure.

Have you ever been opposed by your parents about your association with your girlfriend/boyfriend?<br/><br/>In such a case, you might want to escape with only two people to a distant place where parents don't know.<br/><br/>This act of escaping with two people is called "kakeochi" (駆け落ち) in Japan.<br/>(It seems to be called "elope" in English.)<br/><br/>"Kakeochi" was once written as "欠け落ち," here "欠け" (kake) means "lack" and "落ち" (ochi) means "fall," so it meant to just escape/withdraw from a group.<br/><br/>Later, "駆け" (kake), which means "run," has come to be used instead of "欠け," and it has come to mainly mean that a couple escape to a distant place secretly.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Japan, there are many terms born from shogi (Japanese chess).<br/><br/>Today I will talk about the term, "takabisha" (高飛車), which means to apply coercive pressure or be overpowering.<br/><br/>"Taka" (高) of "takabisha" means "high," and "bisha/hisha" (飛車) means a kind of shogi pieces, that can move horizontally or vertically as much as you want just like a rook in chess.<br/><br/>Originally "takabisya" is a strategy moving a hisya (rook) to the highest place of your territory.<br/><br/>Since this strategy was aggressive and intimidating to the opponent, takabisha came to have the above meaning.

What kind of terms do you say when something go as planned and you rejoice at it secretly.<br/><br/>In such a case, you can say "shime shime" (しめしめ) in Japan.<br/><br/>"Shime shime" is a term made by overlapping the Japanese verb, "shimeru" (占める), which means to occupy something.<br/><br/>For example, it is used like "shime shime, umakuittazo" (しめしめ、うまくいったぞ), which means just something like "Thank God, my plan is working."<br/><br/>Actually, I often heard this term especially in manga, but recently it may not have been used very much.

Previously, I introduced the Japanese idiom, "itachi gokko" (いたちごっこ), which means that two people repeat the same thing to each other.<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/336384032876116770444877313398606169134" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/336384032876116770444877313398606169134</a><br/><br/>In Japan, there is another famous idiom that uses the animal "itachi" (イタチ - weasel).<br/><br/>It is "itachi no saigoppe" (イタチの最後っ屁), the literal meaning of which is "weasel's final fart."<br/><br/>"Itachi no saigoppe" means to use the last resort when you are in trouble or thrust into a bad situation.<br/><br/>This comes from the fact that weasels give off a terrible smell to escape when they are driven by an enemy.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In weekends in Japan, you can find people who are too drunk on a train or a street.<br/><br/>I think that one of the reasons is because there are many taverns that offer "nomi houdai" (飲み放題 - all-you-can-drink) in Japan.<br/><br/>As far as I know, such supplied services are often something like that you can have any drinks including alcohol on menu for for two hours with a charge of 1500 to 2000 yen (13 to 18 dollars).<br/><br/>According to the Internet, such services seem to be rarely offered overseas.<br/><br/>Especially in France and some American states, such services are prohibited by statue.<br/>(Furthermore in France, all-you-can-drink excluding alcohol is also banned.)<br/><br/>Japan is very loose to drinking now, but since people with bad manners are increasing, regulation of alcohol is being considered.

Yesterday, I introduced the expression "tadaima" (ただいま), which means "I'm home."<br/><br/>In Japanese homes, people who were at home usually say "okaeri" (おかえり) or "okaerinasai" (おかえりなさい) as a reply to "tadaima."<br/><br/>"Okaeri" is an expression that corresponds to "welcome home" or "welcome back" in English.<br/><br/>In Japan, people say "tadaima" and "okaeri" on a routine basis, whereas in English-speaking countries, "welcome back" is mainly used only when someone come home/country after a long time.<br/><br/>Incidentally, several Japanese blogs introduced something like -- Native speakers don't use both "I'm home" and "welcome back" on a routine basis -- but I have doubt about this information.<br/><br/>When I watch American dramas, indeed "welcome" back is rarely used, but I think that I often hear the phrase "I'm home."

In Japan, people often say "tadaima" (ただいま) when they arrive at their homes.<br/><br/>This is short for "tadaima kaerimashita" (ただいま帰りました), which is more polite and formal than saying just tadaima.<br/><br/>Here, "tada" means "just," "ima" means "now," and "kaerimashita" means "I'm home" or "I'm back."<br/><br/>Hence "tadaima kaerimashita" means "Just now I'm home," but somehow kaerimashita which means "I'm home" has come to be abbreviated and tadaima has come to have the same meaning as kaerimashita.<br/><br/>It might be derived from the fact that tadaima is easier to say or more approachable than kaerimashita.

Today I finally finished watching the TV drama, Friends, from season one to ten.<br/><br/>Since all characters has grown nicely through the ten years, I feel nostalgic when I think back on the first season.<br/><br/>I watched all episodes with Japanese subtitles, but from now on, I will watch them again from the first episode with English subtitles.<br/><br/>Incidentally, one episode of this drama is about 22 minutes, and there were totally 238 episodes, so it means that I watched them for a total of about 87 hours.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is said that you need about 500 hours listening if you want to an acquire English ability that is enough to travel abroad.<br/><br/>The milestone will be attained if I watch all episodes six times, but it looks like a tough road.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are many idioms that use a part of a body in both English and Japanese.<br/><br/>Today I found an interesting rule in such idioms.<br/><br/>The rule is that Japanese idioms tend to use mouth, whereas English idioms tend to use tongue instead of mouth.<br/><br/>For example, to say something unnecessary is expressed as "kuti ga suberu" (口が滑る - slip one's mouth) in Japanese, wheares it's expressed as "make a slip of the tongue" in English. <br/><br/>Also, to be silent is expressed as "kuchi wo tsumugu" (口をつむぐ - hold one's mouth), wheares it's expressed as "hold one's tongue" in English.<br/><br/>Furthermore, to be careful in one's speech is expressed as "kuchi no kikikata ni kiwotukeru" (口の利き方に気をつける -watch the usage of one's mouth), whereas it's expressed as "watch one's tongue" in English (it seems also be expressed as "watch one's mouth," though).<br/><br/>I think that these are interesting differences.

Japanese people learn about 2000 kanji characters before graduating from junior high school.<br/><br/>Also, it is said that general Japanese adults can read about 3000 to 4000 kanji characters, but young people tend to be not good at kanji.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, "unko kanji doriru" (うんこ漢字ドリル), the literal meaning of which is "poop kanji workbook," became a bestseller throughout Japan.<br/><br/>In this kanji workbook, all example sentences of kanji characters include unko (うんこ - poop).<br/><br/>For example, for the kanji "今" (ima - now), "ここで今すぐうんこをすることもできるんですよ" (I can poop right here right now).<br/><br/>For the kanji "英" (ei - English), "英語さえわかれば、アメリカ人ともうんこの話ができるのに" (if I could speak English, I would talk about unko (poop) with Americans).<br/><br/>I don't know what will become popular.

Have you ever teetered on the brink of life-or-death or win-or-lose.<br/><br/>Such a situation is called "setogiwa" (瀬戸際) in Japan.<br/><br/>"Seto" (瀬戸) of setogiwa means a strait that is narrowed by two land masses, and "giwa" (際) means a boundary.<br/><br/>That is to say, the original meaning of setogiwa is a boundary between a strait and sea.<br/><br/>By extension, setogiwa has come to refer to an important branch point in our lives.<br/><br/>In English, it seems to be expressed as "brink" or "edge" -- I think that the etymology of setogiwa is almost same as these words.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
We sometimes call a child who is naughty and beyond control of adults "wanpaku" (わんぱく).<br/><br/>Wanpaku is written as "腕白" in kanji, here "腕" means "arm" and "白" means "white."<br/><br/>However, since these kanjis are just phonetic symbols, there is no relationship between wanpaku and white arms.<br/><br/>The most widely accepted theory of its etymology is that kanpaku changed into wanpaku.<br/><br/>Kanpaku refers to a bureaucratic position that do politics instead of the Emperor.<br/><br/>That is to say, wanpaku children can exert their powers as a kanpaku with authority can.

In English, the call of chicks is expressed as "cheep-cheep" or "peep-peep," while in Japanese, it's expressed as "piyo piyo" (ピヨピヨ) or "hiyo hiyo." (ヒヨヒヨ)<br/><br/>The Japanese name of chicks, "hiyoko" (ひよこ), comes from the sound "hiyo hiyo."<br/><br/>Furthermore, hiyoko is sometimes called "hiyokko" (ひよっこ) by using the choked sound.<br/><br/>Of course hiyokko can mean hiyoko (chicks), but if you say hiyokko, it often refers to a person with little experience or a young person.<br/><br/>The etymology is very simple -- it was derived from the fact that newborn chicks are immature and inexperienced.<br/><br/>As a similar expression, there is "shiri ga aoi" (尻が青い - blue hip).<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/81406964592254932562079633885566370862" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/81406964592254932562079633885566370862</a>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I think that almost all Japanese people have heard the spell, "chichin puipui."<br/><br/>This spell is mainly used to relieve pain when a child is injured.<br/><br/>In the actual situation, it's often used like "chichin puipui, itaino itaino tondeike" (here "itaino" means "pain" and "tondeike" means "blow away something").<br/><br/>In the past, it was chanted as "chichin puipui goyo no ontakara" (ちちんぷいぷい 御代の御宝), and it's thought that this came from "chijin buyu goyo no ontakara" (智仁武勇御代の御宝)<br/><br/>Chijin means "knowledge," buyu means "force," goyo no ontakara means "our treasure," and it is said that a foster mother of Iemitsu TOKUGAWA, the third Shogun, used this phrase when she made her son stop crying, with the feeling that please don't cry because you are our treasure with both knowledge and power.

I sometimes introduce slang terms, but some of them are becoming obsolete.<br/><br/>For example, there is a slang term, "wake wakame" (わけわかめ), which is used when you can't understand something.<br/><br/>This term comes from the sentence "wake ga wakaranai," the literal meaning of which is "I can't understand the reason" (here "wake" means "reason," and "wakaranai" means "can't understand").<br/><br/>Also, "wakame" of "wake wakame" means "seaweed," and it's a pun for "wakaranai."<br/><br/>Wake wakame once became a dead term after it had spread in 1980s, but it became popular again since it has nominated for the popular word grand prix among high/junior high school girls in 2011.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it's becoming obsolete again now, but I sometimes use it because I like the sound.

When participating in a drinking party, sometimes it becomes "tenya wanya" (てんやわんや).<br/><br/>"Tenya wanya" is a term that represents that a lot of people are moving disorderly and they're being confused. <br/><br/>It is thought that this term comes from two words, "tenden" and "waya."<br/><br/>"Tenden" means "each," and "waya" is a Kansai dialect, which means "impossible" or "unreasonable."<br/><br/>"Tenya wanya" was used as a slang term since the Edo period, but it became very popular in 1948 because it was used as a title of a novel in a newspaper and the novel became a movie.

Yesterday, I participated in a wedding party of my college friend.<br/><br/>It was really nice and I enjoyed meeting and talking with my friends from college for the first time in a long time.<br/><br/>In my yesterday's post, I wrote that about 30% of couples who didn't hold a wedding ceremony divorced, but this was wrong.<br/><br/>I'm sorry.<br/><br/>The fact is that about 30% of all Japanese couples divorce.<br/><br/>Also, according to a survey, about 80% of the divorced couples didn't hold a wedding ceremony.<br/><br/>Since about half of Japanese couples don't hold a wedding ceremony, this survey suggests that people who don't hold a wedding ceremony tend to divorce.<br/><br/>On the other hand, according to the study at Emory University, people who spend a lot of money on their wedding seem to tend to divorce.

Today I will go to my friend's party associated with his marriage.<br/><br/>(I will be careful not to drink too much.)<br/><br/>Recently in Japan, about half of married couples don't hold a wedding ceremony.<br/><br/>The main reason is because it costs too much money or it's difficult to prepare for it.<br/><br/>Also, from the same reasons, couples that hold a small wedding ceremony with only their relatives have increased.<br/><br/>My friend and his partner belong to such a couple -- today's party is just a party with their friends to celebrate their marriage, which is not a wedding ceremony.<br/><br/>Maybe you should consider a wedding ceremony, because I found several interesting information: about 90% of couples who held a wedding ceremony were satisfied it; about 30% of couples who didn't held a wedding ceremony divorced; almost all women have a longing for a wedding ceremony.

Yesterday, I ate dinner with my bosses, and went to several bars until around 3 o'clock in the morning.<br/><br/>Three days ago, I introduced the word "hebereke," which means that someone gets so drunk, but I was in the state of hebereke yesterday.<br/><br/>Since I had to participate in a research meeting in this morning, I decided to go back to my university by taxi and go to bed in my laboratory.<br/><br/>However, in the early morning, I woke up because I felt awful, then I vomited.<br/><br/>Eventually, I participated in the meeting while feeling terrible, but of course it was very painful.<br/><br/>Now I'm flooded with regret.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In order to travel to Japan or enjoy Japanese contents, I think that you need to learn not only textbook terms but also several slang terms that are used by young people.<br/><br/>This is the reason why I sometimes introduce slang terms here.<br/><br/>If you use slang terms in a conversation, maybe you can give an impression that you are good at the language.<br/><br/>However, I recommend that you don't use negative slang terms very much, though you should understand the meaning.<br/><br/>For example, there is an expression, "uzai," which means "annoying" or "depressing."<br/><br/>Uzai is short for "uzattai," and uzattai comes from the onomatopoeia, "uzauza" or "ujauja," which represents that similar things are gathered or someone says something stupid repeatedly.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are several terms that mean something thoughtless, but today I'd like to introduce the term "futodoki" among them, that tends to be used by high-ranked people (this tendency is my opinion).<br/><br/>"Fu" means a denial and "todoki" means to reach, so the literal meaning of futodoki is "not to reach something," and formerly it was used in this meaning.<br/><br/>Later, "principle" and "law" came to be applied as the object that you don't reach, then futodoki has come to mean actions that counter to principles or laws.<br/><br/>Recently, the meaning of futodoki has expanded further -- it often means something outrageous, careless, or insensitive.<br/><br/>Incidentally, a person who have such a character is called "futodoki mono" (不届き者).

I have come into a state called "hebereke" (へべれけ) several times.<br/><br/>Hebereke is a term that means that someone gets drunk too much to lose his/her consciousness or memory.<br/><br/>There is a theory that this term comes from the Greek word, "Hebe erryake," which means something like "Hebe pours alcohol."<br/><br/>Here, Hebe is the goddess who controls the youth in Greek mythology.<br/><br/>However, it's not sure whether or not this etymology is correct.<br/><br/>Incidentally, there is another theory that says that it comes from the Japanese onomatopoeia, "hero hero" and "bero bero," which can refer to a drunk state.

When I started wearing a suit, my shirt tail was often put out from my pants.<br/><br/>Every time my mother found it, and she told me "mittomonai" (みっともない).<br/><br/>Mittomonai is an adjective that means that something looks awkward or someone looks disgraceful.<br/><br/>This term comes from "mitakumonashi" (見たくもなし), the literal meaning of which is "I don't want to see it."<br/><br/>In the past, mittomonai was used to mean that you don't want to see something, but now it's mostly used in the meaning that something/someone looks disgraceful.

Even though I am Japanese, I sometimes come across Japanese words I don't know when referring a dictionary.<br/><br/>Today, I found the Japanese term "orekireki" (お歴々), which refers to people who have a high identity and a high status.<br/><br/>Here "reki" (歴) means that something follows histories or places in succession, or something is clearly different.<br/><br/>Also, the latter "reki" has a function that emphasizes the term just before it, and "rekireki" has come to mean that someone is different (someone has a high identity), in addition to its original meaning.<br/><br/>Later, the polite prefix "o" has often come to added to rekireki, and now orekireki mainly has the above meaning.

Have you ever gazed your surroundings with no cease, while turning to the right and the left repeatedly?<br/><br/>I will take such an action if I go to a new place.<br/><br/>You can refer to the action such as looking at surroundings curiously by using the Japanese onomatopoeia, "kyoro kyoro" (きょろきょろ). <br/><br/>While it can be used as an adverb, like "kyorokyoro to mawari wo miru" (きょろきょろを周りを見る), it can also be used as an noun, like "kyoro kyoro suru" (きょろきょろする).<br/><br/>Also, there is the similar onomatopoeia, "gyoro gyoro."<br/><br/>Gyoro gyoro represents that you look around keenly with your big eyeballs.

<div class="date" hidden>Jun 16, 2017 13:16</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Up to now, I introduced several times about Japanese giongo (擬音語) / giseigo (擬声語) and gitaigo (擬態語).<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/86267710602984537206970840486887149264" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/86267710602984537206970840486887149264</a><br/><br/>Both of them can be translated into English as 'onomatopoeia,' but there is a clear difference in the way of use.<br/><br/>Giongo/giseigo is a term that represents an actual sound caused by people, animal, or things.<br/>For example, a dog's bark is "wan wan" (ワンワン), and a sound of thunder is "goro goro" (ゴロゴロ).<br/><br/><br/>On the other hand, gitaigo represents someone's/something's state or emotion that doesn't generate any sound.<br/>For example, something shining/new/beautiful is "kira kira" (きらきら), and staring at someone's face or something is "jiro jiro" (じろじろ).<br/><br/>It might be hard for foreigner to understand gitaigo, but it's necessary in our daily conversation.<br/><br/>From now on, I will sometimes write about Japanese gitaigo, adding a tag "onomatopoeia."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In yesterday's post, I introduced the word "otenba," which means a spirited girl.<br/><br/>Actually, there is the similar term, which is called "jaja uma" (じゃじゃ馬).<br/><br/>"Jaja" is an onomatopoeia that represents something noisy/spoiled, "uma" means a horse, and jaja uma originally refers to a restive horse that doesn't get used to people.<br/><br/>This came to be metaphorically used to humans, especially women.<br/><br/>Both otenba and jaja uma refer to a spirited girl, but in the strict sense, jaja uma refers to an wayward woman who are hard to deal with.<br/><br/>I think that this is really idle information, but I prefer to both otenba and jaja uma.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There is the Japanese word "otenba" (おてんば), which refers to a spirited girl who has mannish character.<br/><br/>Otenba has been used since the Edo period, and there are various theories about its etymology.<br/><br/>The most famous one is a theory that it comes from the Dutch "ontembaar," which means "indomitable" or "irrepressible."<br/><br/>However, since "tenba" (てんば - which had the similar meaning of otenba) had been used before otenba spread in Japan, it's more natural to think that a prefix 'o' denoting polite has been attached to tenba.<br/><br/>Also, it's thought that tenba was derived from the adjective "tebashi" or "tebashikoi," which once used to mean that someone is alert/active.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the kanji "お転婆" of otenba is just a phonetic equivalent character.

There are several Japanese terms that mean to imitate something, such as "mane," "mohou," or "pakuri."<br/><br/>However, if you can use the term "niban senji" (二番煎じ), it may be a little cool.<br/><br/>"Niban" (二番) means "second" and "senji" (煎じ) means to brew/decoct tea or medicinal herbs.<br/><br/>That is to say, niban senji refers to brew something again that was brewed, and the taste of such tea or medicine will of course become thin.<br/><br/>Based on this fact, niban senji has come to refer to warmed-over things that imitates/repeats existing ones.

<div class="date" hidden>Jun 12, 2017 18:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There is the Japanese adverb "gussuri" (ぐっすり), which implies being deep asleep.<br/><br/>Actually, a Japanese TV show introduced that "gussuri" comes from "good sleep" in English, so I think that many Japanese people believe the etymology.<br/><br/>However, this term has been used since the Edo period, which was the period when Japan had closed the country to foreign commerce, hence it's hard to think that it came from English.<br/><br/>Originally, gussuri was used as an onomatopoeia that means "jūbun-ni" (十分に - fully) or "sukkari" (すっかり - totally).<br/><br/>It is thought that since it was often used with the verb "nemuru" (眠る - sleep), it came to have the meaning as having a good night's sleep.

 If you look up the Japanese word "miyage" (土産) or "omiyage" (お土産) in an English-Japanese dictionary, you can find the English word, "souvenir."<br/><br/>I thought that both of them have almost the same meaning, but the way of use seems to be different.<br/><br/>Both imply local products or specialties for the land, but miyage basically refers to what you buy as gifts to your friends or colleagues.<br/><br/>On the other hand, souvenirs refer to what you buy just for yourself.<br/><br/>(Miyage can be used in both cases.)<br/><br/>Incidentally, many of miyage in  various places in Japan are food -- it might be related to the fact that Japanese people tend to present miyage for many people in their workplaces or schools.

Have you ever been pretended to be out even though you are actually at home.<br/><br/>In Japanese, such behavior is called "irusu" (居留守) in one word.<br/><br/>This word was born by composing two words, "i" (居 - existence) and "rusu" (留守 - absense).<br/><br/>On the other hand, in English, you seem to have express something like "pretend to be out" or "pretend not to be at home," and I couldn't find a noun that corresponds to irusu.<br/><br/>The reason why there is the noun "irusu" in Japanese might be derived from the fact that Japanese people often use irusu (pretend to be out).

Have you ever deranged your way of speaking or the talk itself when you were nervous or got drunk.<br/><br/>Such a state is called "shidoro modoro" (しどろもどろ) in Japanese.<br/><br/>"Shidoro" comes from an adjective "shidoshinai" (しどしない), which means that someone is sloppy due to the disarrayed hair or clothes.<br/><br/>"Modoro" comes from a verb "modoroku" (もどろく), which means to be cluttered up, and it strengthens the meaning of "shidoro."<br/><br/>In the past, shidoro modoro meant only a state of drunken, but it has come to refer to that something is deranged in a board sense.

When I'm looking for Japanese terms to introduce on Lang-8, I can find various indirect expressions that abuse someone.<br/><br/>I think that the reason why various indirect expressions were born is because Japanese people tended to say praises and insults indirectly rather than directly.<br/><br/>For example, today I found the phrase "udo no taiboku."<br/><br/>Udo no taiboku means a person or something that has a big body but is useless.<br/><br/>"Udo" is a kind of plant, "aralia cordata" in English, and its buds are often used as food.<br/><br/>The udo grows very big like "taiboku," meaning "big tree," but then it can't be used as not only food but also building materials -- it will be almost garbage.<br/><br/>From this fact, udo no taiboku has come to mean a useless person or something.

Previously I wrote about "asameshi mae," which means that it's quite easy to do something.<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/291692739634610672381429665747648285644" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/291692739634610672381429665747648285644</a><br/><br/>In Japanese, there is a more casual term "ochanoko saisai," which has the same meaning as "asameshi mae."<br/><br/>"Ochanoko" means Japanese cakes served with tea, and since it's easy to eat and digest them, it came to have the above meaning.<br/><br/>"Saisai" is a kind of exclamation that is used in traditional Japanese folk songs, and have no particular meaning.<br/><br/>I like the sound of this phrase, but unfortunately the number of people who use it seems to be decreasing.<br/><br/>Incidentally, "he no kappa" has also the similar meaning.<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/191665208695223752666684613979550944204" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/191665208695223752666684613979550944204</a>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are many vital parts in human bodies.<br/><br/>Today I'd like to introduce the part called "mizo-ochi" among of them.<br/><br/>Mizo-ochi refers to a concave part in the center of your chest or the upper side of your stomach -- it's technically called epigastrium.<br/><br/>There are so many sympathetic nerves in the back of mizo-ochi (which is technically called “celiac plexus”), it is very sensitive to pain.<br/><br/>If an impact is sent there, your diaphragm may temporarily stop, which may cause dyspnea.<br/><br/>Incidentally, "mizo-ozhi" comes from "mizu ochi," which means "where water falls" (mizu means water and ochi means to fall).

"Hanikamu" (はにかむ) is a verb that means to feel embarrassed or get shy.<br/><br/>I think that the basis to feel embarrassed is divided into two patterns -- happy feeling and pitiable feeling.<br/><br/>Hanikamu implies the happy feeling, and people usually make a little smile when they do it.<br/><br/>This term originally meant to have misaligned teeth, then it changed to mean to bare teeth.<br/><br/>Furthermore, since bared teeth looks like an embarrassed smile, it has come to have the above meanings.<br/><br/>Note that if you write it in Katakana like "ハニカム," it will mean honeycomb structure.

How many compliments do you have?<br/><br/>Of course, I think that there are various types of compliments in every language.<br/><br/>Today I'd like to introduce Japanese one of them, "kerenmi ga nai" (けれん味がない), which is high-toned and is difficult to use even for us.<br/><br/>"Kerenmi" comes from a Kabuki term, and it means to call a bluff or to play dumb.<br/><br/>Therefore, "kerenmi ga nai" (there is no 'kerenmi') means that there is no pretense, bluff, and lie -- that refers to sincerity.<br/><br/>Basically this term is used as a compliment, but note that it could be used with a negative connotation, for example in the media world where bluffs and lies are needed.

As Japanese terms that represent a man with good appearance, there are "otoko mae" and "ike men" ("ike" is short for "iketeru," which means "cool").<br/><br/>In most cases, we use these terms or the English loanword "handsome."<br/><br/>However, if the man is very attractive with a tight face, "nigami bashitta ii-otoko" may be more appropriate.<br/><br/>"nigami" means "bitter taste," "bashitta" mean "run" or "spread," and "ii-otoko" means "regular guy."<br/><br/>If you eat something bitter, you will frown up your face, and some people will think that it's a firm face and attractive.<br/><br/>Because of this, becoming such a firm face has come to be called "sibumi bashiru," and now it is usually used as an adjective, such as "nigami bashitta kao" ("kao" means "face") or "nigami bashitta otoko" ("otoko" means "man").<br/><br/>I think that this the meaning of term is similar to the one of the English word "dandy."

When showing that someone is very busy or something is deadly/important, we often say "taihen (大変)."<br/><br/>I think that many of us have negative images for "taihen," such as "hard," "tiring," or "major incident."<br/><br/>In fact, taihen is usually used in a bad meaning.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the kanji "大 (tai)" and "変 (hen)" mean "big" and "change" respectively, so "taihen" can also impliy "big change."<br/><br/>Because of this, some people think of taihen as a positive sense -- it's a big chance to change yourself.<br/><br/>However, since it still has a strong negative image, please be careful to use it.

In Japan, there have been a lot of expressions that use word association since ancient times.<br/><br/>For example, in the Heian Period people often said "sode wo nurasu" instead of "naku," which means to cry.<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "sode wo nurasu" is to wet your sleeve -- since people wiped tears with their sleeves, wet sleeves symbolized tears.<br/><br/>There is a similar expression, "sode wo siboru," the literal meaning of which is to wring your sleeve.<br/><br/>It implies that your sleeve gets so wet that you can wring it by hand.<br/><br/>Incidentally, since pillows have become commonly used, the expression "makura wo nurasu" (to wet your pillow) has also come to be used to mean to cry.

During watching Japanese dramas or anime, you may hear the dialogue "hidoi (ひどい)."<br/><br/>"Hidoi" is an adjective that refers to that something is cruel or very bad.<br/><br/>In Buddhism, training to seek enlightenment is called "dou (道)," the literal meaning of which is "road."<br/><br/>Also, going off the dou is called "hidou (非道)," by attaching the negative prefix "hi (非)."<br/><br/>This "hidou" has gradually come to mean to go off humanity, then it has also come to mean inhumanity or a lack in common sense.<br/><br/>"Hidoi" is an adjective form of this "hidou."

It is important to make an educated guess or establish a goal when you conduct/investigate something.<br/><br/>Such making an educated guess is often called "meboshi wo tsukeru (目星をつける)" in Japan.<br/><br/>"Me (目)" means "eye," "boshi (星)" usually means "star," but it also means "mark" derived from "star mark."<br/><br/>Since "tsukeru (つける)" means "to put/attach something," the literal meaning of "meboshi wo tsukeru" is "to put a mark."<br/><br/>In turn, this term has come to mean "to make an educated guess" or "to establish a goal."

Woman: "Why were you late for our date today?"<br/><br/>Man: "Yesterday, I played a game until midnight after work. The game is an online game, and I played with my friends. You know, we have to cherish friends, right? <br/>It also can release stress of my work. Although I played the game, I got up early in the morning. Believe me. However, it was hard to decide my hairstyle..."<br/><br/>Woman: "Enough. Don't line up gotaku (Don't give me a song and dance)!"<br/><br/>The idiom "gotaku wo naraberu" means to say selfish reasons in a snobbish manner like this man.<br/><br/>"Gotaku" is an abbreviation for "gotakusen," which means to say someone's thought as if it were a statement of God, and "naraberu" means to "line up something."<br/><br/>In such a case, you should say sorry first instead of lining up gotaku.

Japanese people tend to avoid direct expressions, and use euphemism/ambiguous ones in daily communication.<br/><br/>You may think that it's difficult to convey the true intention, but we feel that Japanese speakers who handle euphemism skillfully are cool.<br/><br/>For example, there is the expression "yabusaka dehanai."<br/><br/>"Yabusaka" is a term that refers to a negative feeling, such as hesitation or wobble.<br/><br/>By attaching the negative term "dehanai" to this, it can refer to a positive attitude, such as "I don't mind doing that," or "I would rather do that." <br/><br/>If a foreigner says "yabusaka dehanai," I may think that he/her uses Japanese better than recent young Japanese people.

Recently in Japan, you can hear the keyword "sechigarai (世知辛い)" frequently.<br/><br/>This term means that it's difficult to live in the world.<br/><br/>"Sechi (世知)" of "sechigarai" is a Buddhist term,and it originally represents "secular wisdom" or "worldly talent."<br/><br/>In turn "sechi" took on another meaning, that is, "shrewd," "calculating," or "petty."<br/><br/>Also, "garai" of "sechigarai" is a suffix word that emphasizes "sechi."<br/><br/>Since it's difficult to live in a world where there are many shrewd people, "sechigarai" has come to the above meaning.<br/><br/>In most cases, it's used like "sechigarai yononaka da" (it's the difficult world).<br/>("Yononaka" means the world.)

When discussing with a lot of people, it's difficult to reach agreement.<br/><br/>In such a case, a person of influence/power may suppress others' opinions and bring an end to the argument by only a single statement.<br/><br/>The statement is called "tsuru no hitokoe (鶴の一声) " in Japan.<br/><br/>Here, "tsuru" means "crane" and "hitokoe" means "statement." <br/><br/>Cranes are known as animals that sing in a high pitch note while displaying a threatening attitude.<br/><br/>Since the song has enough power to make surroundings silence for a moment, a statement that silences people came to be called "tsuru no hitokoe" (crane's statement).<br/><br/>Incidentally, this term is also called "suzume no senkoe tsuru no hitokoe."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "suzume no senkoe (雀の千声)" is "sparrows' thousand statements," and it expresses a lot of low value statements.

What is the element required for an attractive woman in your country?<br/><br/>In Japan, we tend to regard "okuyukashii (奥ゆかしい)" women as beautiful.<br/><br/>"Okuyukashii" is an adjective word that means that something/someone is modest, elegant, and sensitive to people.<br/><br/>"Oku" means "deep inside" and "yukashii" means "to want to go somewhere," so "okuyukashii" means "to want to go to/see/know deep inside something/someone" -- it expresses the feeling of fascination.<br/><br/>Then okuyukashii has come to have the above meanings, and now it usually means a modest/elegant attitude of a woman.<br/><br/>That is to say, attractive Japanese women for Japanese men are okuyukashii women.

"Niyakeru (にやける)" is a Japanese verb that is commonly used.<br/><br/>However, according to a poll conducted several years ago, around 77% of Japanese use this verb in the wrong sense.<br/><br/>Niyakeru is a term for men, and it means to glam up sexily like women, or to be wishy-washy.<br/><br/>However, most Japanese seem to think that niyakeru means to smile thinly.<br/><br/>I think that the reason is because it's similar to an onomatopoeia "niyaniya," which represents the sound coming from a thin smile.<br/><br/>Since there are so many people who misunderstand the meaning, the meaning in dictionaries may change in the near future.

If you do what you want to do, some problems may happen.<br/><br/>In such a case, I think that it's difficult to decide whether or not you should do that.<br/><br/>We call this situation "itashi kayushi （痛し痒し）" in Japanese.<br/><br/>"Itashi" (痛し) means "painful," "kayushi" (痒し) means "itchy," and the idiom "itashi kayushi" implies a situation that it will be painful if you scratch at a spot (e.g., where is stung by an insect) of your body, and it will be itchy if you don't scratch there.<br/><br/>That is to say, this idiom means a situation where it's difficult to decide what you should do because both choices have good aspects and bad aspects.<br/><br/>I don't want to be in such a situation, itashi kayushi.

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese idiom "jibara wo kiru (自腹を切る)."<br/><br/>"Ji (自)" means yourself, "bara (腹)" means abdomen, and "kiru (切る)" means to cut something.<br/><br/>Therefore the literal meaning is "to cut your own abdomen," corresponding to "seppuku/harakiri," but it actually refers to spend your own money on something that you don't necessarily need to pay.<br/><br/>Here, "jibara (your abdomen)" and "kiru (to cut)" are metaphors for "your own money" and "to use," respectively.<br/><br/>In the past, Japanese samurai committed seppuku (cut their own abdomens) with firm resolve to accept the blame.<br/><br/>It might need firm resolve to spend your extra money.

Today I'd like to talk about the Japanese term "chiguhagu."<br/><br/>"Chiguhagu" means that two or more things/people are incongruous, or there are no harmony among them.<br/><br/>Originally, "chigu" meant a hammer and "hagu" meant a nail puller. <br/><br/>("Gu" that is included in both chigu and hagu means "tool.")<br/><br/>A theory about its etymology says that "chiguhagu" comes from the fact that work don't proceed when you alternately use a hammer and a nail puller.<br/><br/>Also, another theory says that it was derived from the fact that a master carpenter and a carpenter worked while exchanging a hammer and a nail puller.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "sahanji."<br/><br/>Sahanji means ordinary things that are not uncommon in everyday life.<br/><br/>This term is composed of three words: "sa," "han," and "ji," those are "tea" "rice," and "thing," respectively.<br/><br/>Since drinking tea and eating rice were daily routine actions for Japanese, the term "sahanji" was born.<br/><br/>It is often used as "nichijou sahanji" by putting "nichijou," which means "daily."<br/><br/>However, in recent years, the consumption of coffee has greatly increased in Japan.<br/><br/>If the number of people who drink coffee significantly exceeds those who drink tea, "sahanji" may become "coffee-hanji."

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese word "sake."<br/><br/>"Sake" is a generic term for beverages that contain alcohol, and it often referred to as "osake" by attaching a polite prefix "o."<br/><br/>When saying "sake" in English, it usually means "Japanese sake," which is a kind of rice wine.<br/><br/>There are various theories about the etymology of "sake," but I will introduce the most accepted ones.<br/><br/>The theory says that "sa" is a prefix that fixes the rhythm of the word, and "ke" is the changed form of "ki," which was the old name of "sake."<br/><br/>Since I drank a lot of alcohol yesterday, I'm a little fluffy.

Today I will talk about the term "uma no hone."<br/><br/>"Uma" means "horse," "hone" means "bones," and "uma no hone" refers to a person from nowhere or an incapable person.<br/><br/>This term comes from the fact that Chinese said "firstly chicken ribs, secondly horse bones" as examples of useless things.<br/><br/>Chicken ribs are too small to be useful.<br/><br/>Horse bones are also useless, furthermore, it's difficult to dispose of them.<br/><br/>It's said that because of this, "uma no hone" has come to the current meanings described above.<br/><br/>In Japan, the phrase "どこの馬の骨ともわからんやつにうちの娘はやれん," which means "I never give my daughter to a man from nowhere (such as you)" is really famous.

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "chokkai."<br/><br/>"Chokkai" means to interfere from sideways or to make a move on someone with a light heart.<br/><br/>"Cho" of "chokkai" is a part of "chotto," which means "a little," "kai" means "to scratch," and "chokkai" originally meant that a cat or a dog scratches and pulls something by moving the front paw a little.<br/><br/>Since the action looked like a lark or just confirming something without reason, the term has come to the meaning as "to meddle with something."<br/><br/>In most cases, it's used like "chokkai wo dasu" ("dasu" means "to put something out"), or "chokkai wo kakeru" ("kakeru" means "to put something on").

Today is Haha no Hi (Mother's Day) to express appreciation to the mother.<br/><br/>In many countries such as the US, Australia, Germany, Brazil, China and Japan, the second Sunday in May is Mother's Day.<br/><br/>However, the origin and the date of Mother's Day are different in many countries.<br/><br/>For example, Mother's Day is: the first Sunday in May in Spain and South Africa, the last Sunday in May in France, Sweden and Morocco, the third Sunday in October in Argentina, and the last Sunday in November in Russia.<br/><br/>In Japan, Mother's Day was March 6, but it didn't spread.<br/><br/>After that, an event to honor the mother was held on May 8, which became a trigger, and finally the second Sunday in May became Mother's Day after the fashion of the US.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I completely forgot the Mother's Day this year.<br/><br/>I ordered flowers just few hours ago, but it may not reach today.

Today I will talk about the term "ponzu."<br/><br/>"Ponzu" refers to a seasoning in Japanese cuisine, that is made by adding acetic acid to juice of citrus.<br/><br/>This term comes from the Dutch word "pons," which means juice of citrus.<br/><br/>Furthermore, "pons" comes from the Hindi word "panc," which means "five."<br/><br/>The thing is that "pons" originally meant a type of cocktail that was made by mixing five ingredients, such as juice of citrus, sugar, and spices.<br/><br/>However, I heard that the word "pons" has obsoleted now in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the kanji "酢" of "ポン酢 (ponzu)" can be read as "su," and means "vinegar" -- the origin of this Japanese term is a kind of pun.

Today I will talk about the verb "saboru."<br/><br/>"Saboru" means to skip your work or class in idleness.<br/><br/>Many Japanese people might believe that this is a pure Japanese verb, but actually it comes from the French "sabotage."<br/><br/>"Sabotage" is a kind of labor disputes, for example, labors intentionally destroy machines and inflict heavy damage on managers to promote resolution of issues.<br/><br/>Here, "sabotage" comes from the French word "sabot," which means "clog."<br/><br/>It is said that the reason is because French workers kicked and destroyed machines with sabots/clogs.<br/><br/>Note that the nuance of Japanese verb "saboru" is different from the French/English term "sabotage" -- "saboru" is used to mean just something like "to shirk."

Today I will talk about the common Japanese adjective "utsukushii."<br/><br/>"Utsukushii" refers to that colors, shapes or sounds of something are beautiful.<br/><br/>This term comes from the verb "itsukushimu," which expresses a feeling of compassion for weaker persons than yourself.<br/><br/>Therefore "utsukushii" originally referred to the same meaning of "itsukushimu." <br/><br/>However, around the beginning of the Heian period, it came to express feelings of cute/sweet for tiny/young ones, and after the end of the Heian period, it has come to have the current meaning.<br/><br/>Also, the kanji for "utsukushii" is "美しい," and "美" can be decomposed into "羊," meaning sheep, and "大," meaning big.<br/><br/>This might be related that sheep were very rare in the past in China, and they were used as a reward or a gift to God.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "batta-mon."<br/><br/>"Batta-mon" means an official item that didn't go through proper/licensed distribution channels.<br/><br/>It's genuine and inexpensive, but is difficult to sell through normal channels because it is often expired or has deteriorated packaging.<br/><br/>Originally, "batta" was used as a jargon referring to "dumping (price)" among merchants.<br/><br/>Because of this, shops that sell inexpensive items or items that didn't go through licensed channels came to be called "batta-ya" ("ya" means "shop"), and items in such shops came to be called "batta-mon" ("mon" means "thing").<br/><br/>Because of the same reason, "batta-mon" is often used to mean "cheap imitation items" or "shoddy goods."

Today I will talk about the Japanese proverb "uso mo houben."<br/><br/>"Uso mo houben" means that sometimes you need to tell a lie for the attainment of your purpose.<br/><br/>Here, "uso" means "a lie," and "houben" means a way to lead a person closer to enlightenment in Buddhism.<br/><br/>It is said that this proverb comes from the following parable called "sansha kataku" in Buddhist scriptures.<br/><br/>Once upon a time, an old man's mansion was on fire.<br/><br/>Children who were playing in the mansion didn't notice the fire, and they didn't go outside despite the persuasion of the old man.<br/><br/>Then the old man said "a sheep carriage, a deer carriage, and a cow carriage that you wanted are outside of this house," and led the children out.

Today I'd like to talk about the term "anpontan."<br/><br/>"Anpontan" is a term that is used to rail at someone's stupidity as well as "baka" and "aho."<br/>(For more information on the word “baka,” please refer to my yesterday’s post.)<br/><br/>However, since the rhythm of the term is funny and light, it's softer expression compared to "baka" and "aho."<br/><br/>Also, "anpontan" is often used with a kind of affection -- it's just like when a mother scolds her child gently.<br/><br/>It is thought that this term comes from "ahondara," which is a composite word of "aho," meaning "stupid," and "darasuke," meaning "fool."

Today I will talk about the Japanese proverb "sumeba miyako."<br/><br/>"Sumeba miyako" means that even if the place is difficult to live, you will feel as if it's miyako once you live.<br/><br/>Here the word "miyako" comes from "miyadokoro," and both mean a place where the emperor lives, that is the capital.<br/><br/>Therefore, the suffix of "Tokyo" is "to" ("to" is another reading of "miyako") instead of "ken," meaning "prefecture" -- "Tokyo-to" expresses that it is the Japanese capital.<br/><br/>Also, there is a similar proverb, which is "sumaba miyako."<br/><br/>"Sumaba miyako" means that miyako (the capital city) is the best if you would live, and it's quite different from "sumeba miyako."

Today I will talk about the Japanese idiom "neko no me."<br/><br/>"Neko" means "cat" and "me" means "eyes," so "neko no me" can literally mean "cat's eyes," but it is also used to mean that things change at a bewildering pace.<br/><br/>This meaning was derived from the fact that shapes and sizes of cats' eyes change drastically -- they become rounded or thinned depending on the surrounding brightness.<br/><br/>Pupils of cats can grow about three times larger than ones of people, and the sensitivity to light is more than six times.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are a layer called "tapetum" on back sides of cats' retinae.<br/><br/>Since "tapetum" reflects light, cats can sense light twice with their retinae.<br/><br/>Therefore, as long as there is a little light, cats can see things in the dark.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "chiya-hoya."<br/><br/>"Chiya-hoya" means that someone is payed attention or is treated indulgently.<br/><br/>This term is derived from the idiom "choyo hanayo," the literal meaning of which is "as with a butterfly or a flower," and it means that someone is pampered and spoiled.<br/><br/>The reason why "choyo hanayo" expresses the meaning is because both butterflies and flowers are beautiful and are nurtured carefully.<br/><br/>Originally, it was "hanaya choya," and it changed to "choya hanaya," finally "choyo hanayo."<br/><br/>As you can image, "choya hanaya" in the process of the change became "chiya hoya" for short.

Today I will go to Kamikochi with my friends.<br/><br/>Kamikochi is one of largest depositional plains in Japan, the altitude of which is around 1500 meters.<br/><br/>It is thought that a river dammed by eruption activities and made a pond, then sediments deposited there.<br/><br/>The winter in Kamikochi is very cold -- the average temperature in January is -7.7 ℃, and the lowest temperature is below -30 ℃.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the average temperature in summer is around 20 ℃, so you can go sightseeing comfortably.<br/><br/>However, note that the average temperature of some areas don't exceed 10 ℃, that is a tundra climate.<br/><br/>Since Kamikochi is very beautiful, when you come to Nagano prefecture, please visit it.

Now it is a golden week (a cluster of holidays) in Japan.<br/><br/>Today, I climbed at Takao-san in Hachioji city.<br/><br/>The mountain is only 599 meters high, but it is located not far from the center of Tokyo, a lot of people visit there.<br/><br/>There are about five climbing routes, and almost all of them take one and half to two hours.<br/><br/>Since there are also cable cars and lifts, you can arrive at near the mountain's summit easily if you use them.<br/><br/>Although it was the first time for me to climb at this mountain, I chose a relatively hard route.<br/><br/>However, I was really terribly tired because I haven't do exercise recently.

Today I would like to talk about the word "piero."<br/><br/>"Piero" means a performer who puts on lots of makeup and entertains people by his funny looks and actions.<br/><br/>There is the Japanese word "doukeshi," which has the same meaning of "piero," but "piero" is more commonly used.<br/><br/>The word "piero" was derived from the French word "pierrot," which is a nickname of a role in a comedy show.<br/><br/>Actually, "piero" that is referred to in Japan is equivalent to "clown" for other countries, including France.<br/><br/>I heard that Japanese called "clown" "piero" by mistake, and it has become widespread.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese common word "互角 (gokaku)."<br/><br/>"互 (go)" means "each other," "角 (kaku)" means "horn," and "互角" means that there is almost no difference among two, and it's difficult to decide the winning or the losing.<br/><br/>Actually, this word was originally written as "牛角 (gokaku)," the literal meaning of "牛" is "bull."<br/><br/>As the name indicates, the word "牛角" was derived from "bull's horns."<br/><br/>The thing is, left and right horns of a bull have almost the same length and size, so "牛角" came to mean something like "equivalent."<br/><br/>Note that the other kanji "互角" has been used since the Muromachi period, and "牛角" is no longer used now. <br/><br/>If you write as "牛角," it will be read as "gyu kaku" in most cases, which indicates a kind of Japanese yakiniku (roasted meat) restaurants.

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese word "yakimochi."<br/><br/>"Yaki" means "roasted," "mochi" means "rice cake," so "yakimochi" can literally mean "roasted rice cake," but it often used to mean "jealousy" or "envy."<br/><br/>In such a case, it is often used something like "yakimochi wo yaku," literally meaning "to roast a rice cake," and it refers "to feel jealous."<br/><br/>In Japanese, getting jealous is translated into "shitto suru," and is also said as "yaku."<br/><br/>Here, the readings of "yaku" to mean "to get jealous" and "yaku" to mean "to roast" are the same.<br/><br/>It is said that "mochi" (rice cake) was attached to this verb "yaki" as a joke, the word "yakimochi," meaning "jealousy" was born.

There is a proverb, "hayaoki wa sanmon no toku," in Japan.<br/><br/>"Hayaoki" means "getting up early," "sanmon" means "three cheap coins," and "toku" means "benefit."<br/><br/>That is to say, this proverb says that you should get up early because you can get somewhat benefit at least.<br/><br/>However, according to a recent study conducted by Dr. Kelley at Oxford University, getting up early could rise risks of various diseases and decline work performances.<br/><br/>Demonstration experiments conducted at Harvard University and Nevada University imply the correctness of this theory.<br/><br/>Since I wake up at around 5 a.m. recently, I start my work before 7 a.m., but I may have to go to bed late and get up late for health.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the four-character idiom "jaku niku kyo shoku" (弱肉強食).<br/><br/>"Jaku" means "weak," "niku" means "meat," "kyo" means "strong," "shoku" means "eat," and this idiom means a world/society that weak ones become preys of strong ones -- the results depends directly on the differences in ability.<br/><br/>This idiom comes from "弱之肉、強之食," meaning "weak is the meat, strong eats it," written by a Chinese literati called Han Yu.<br/><br/>Before biology was developed, since people thought that carnivorous animals were strong and herbivorous animals were just preys, such an idiom was born by applying it to human society.<br/><br/>However, recently it has been cleared that predation is not easy in actual nature, and the number of herbivorous animals greatly affect the survival of carnivorous animals.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is said that "kyozon kyoei" (co-existence and co-prosperity) or "tekisha seizon" (survival of the fittest) is more appropriate than "jaku niku kyo shoku" as a term for describing the natural world (the jungle law).

Today I will talk about the Japanese word "omae."<br/><br/>"Omae" is a word that refers to a person in front of you -- it's something like "you."<br/><br/>Basically, this word is used for your friends or lower ranking people.<br/><br/>"Omae" was made by attaching the prefix "o" to "mae," which means "in front of," and it was originally used for Buddha or nobilities with respect.<br/><br/>Although it was used with genuine respect until around the early Edo period, the meaning of respect gradually faded, and it came to used for only your friends or lower ranking people after the Meiji period.<br/><br/>Since many Japanese people will get offended if they are called "omae," be careful when you use it.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I'd like to talk about the Japanese term "asameshi mae."<br/><br/>"Asameshi" of "asameshi mae" means "breakfast," "mae" means "before."<br/><br/>This term sometimes means "before breakfast" literally, but it often means that it is quite easy to do something.<br/><br/>Since you are hungry and don't have much time before eating breakfast, you can only do simple tasks.<br/><br/>In particular, we had meals two times a day until the middle of the Edo period, so we couldn't bring out our real strengths before breakfast.<br/><br/>From this fact, "asameshi mae" (before breakfast) came to mean easy tasks that you can finish before you eat breakfast.

Today I will talk about the Japanese slang term "madogiwa zoku."<br/><br/>"Madogiwa" means "windows side." "zoku" means "tribe," and "madogiwa zoku" means employees or staff (especially middle-aged and elderly people) who has been put out to pasture.<br/><br/>This term comes from "madogiwa ojisan" ("ojisan" means "elderly man"), which was used in a column of the Hokkaido Shimbun (Hokkaido newspaper) in 1977.<br/><br/>In the column, "madogiwa ojisan" was used for meaning elderly people who were discharged from management posts, and read newspapers or stare out window to kill time at the window side desks.<br/><br/>This term came to be widely used, then it became "madogiwa zoku" for general use.<br/><br/>However, I prefer to a desk at the window side.

Today I will talk about the Japanese word "ugai."<br/><br/>"Ugai" means an act of rinse/gargle your mouth or throat with water to clean it up.<br/><br/>This word comes from a famous ayu (sweetfish) fishing called "ukai" in Gifu prefecture, the literal meaning of which is "to tame a cormorant."<br/><br/>This is because in the ukai, fishermen have cormorants swallow ayu in the water, then have them spit it out on the boat.<br/><br/>In Japan, people have done "ugai" since the Heian era, but it is said that doing "unagi" as preventing cold is an unique Japanese custom.<br/><br/>Actually, it has been skeptical for a long time whether or not "ugai" has an effect to prevent cold.<br/><br/>However, recently the effectiveness has been proved scientifically.

Today I will talk about the Japanese word "otsumu."<br/><br/>"Otsumu" is another way of saying "atama," which means "head," and it is mainly used for infants.<br/><br/>In the past, something round and small was called "tsuburi" -- the word was made by changing "tsubu," which means "grain."<br/><br/>Also, child's small head was referred to as "tsumuri," by changing "tsuburi."<br/><br/>Next, "tsumuri" changed to "otsumuri" by attaching the prefix, "o," which makes words polite.<br/><br/>Finally, "ri" of "otsumuri" was abbreviated, and it became "otsumu."<br/><br/>Note that if you use "otsumu" to adults, it will be ironic in most cases.<br/><br/>For example: "Otsumu ga yowai" (You're weak in the head). "Otsumu ga tarinai" (Your wit is wanting.)

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese word "taisetsu."<br/><br/>"Taisetsu" means something important, or to cherish something.<br/><br/>This word comes from "ooini seppaku suru," which can be abbreviated to "taisetsu" in Kanji.<br/><br/>Here, "ooini" means "very," "seppaku suru" means "imminent."<br/><br/>Originally, "taisetsu" literally means that something is imminent, but connected to this meaning, it came to mean that something is important.<br/><br/>Furthermore, since something important is something irreplaceable, it also imply "to love someone/something wholeheartedly."<br/><br/>In fact, a Portuguese dictionary translate "taisetsu" into "love."<br/><br/>In most cases, you can replace "taisetsu" with "juyo" (important), but I feel that "taisetsu" is softer and warmer than "juyo."

<div class="date" hidden>Apr 13, 2017 09:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I talked about the etymology of the Japanese word, "narikin," which means "new rich."<br/><br/>According to an ancient Greek philosopher called Aristotle, narikin (new riches) have the following characteristics.<br/><br/>They have a characteristic of a foolish person who has a good luck.<br/><br/>They act big and look down others because they think that they have all good things.<br/><br/>They show off their money.<br/><br/>They think of money as the standard of all evaluation.<br/><br/>Incidentally, originally in Japan, "narikin" (new rich) was used in a good sense.<br/><br/>However, now it is often used to express feelings of mockery or hatred.

Today I will talk about the word "narikin."<br/><br/>"Narikin" means a person who became rich in a short period, and it corresponds to the term "new rich" in English.<br/><br/>This word comes from a kind of board games, "shogi," which is similar to chess.<br/><br/>In shogi, when pieces except the king (ohsho) and gold generals (kinsho) enter the enemy territory, they can change their characters (this act is called "naru" in Japanese).<br/><br/>In particular, if the ranks of these pieces are lower than gold generals, they can change to new pieces that are equivalent to the gold general (kinsho).<br/><br/>From this rule, a person who suddenly became rich came to be called "narikin" (change to a gold general).

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "chu chu tako kaina."<br/><br/>This term is a kind of counting rhymes, which is used when counting the number of something in two units (it's something like "two, four, six, eight...").<br/><br/>There are several theories about this term, but the most widely accepted one is something like the following.<br/><br/>The word "chu" comes from the sugoroku (Japanese backgammon) term "juji," which means double two, that is four.<br/><br/>When you say "chu chu," it means eight, and this number represents the number of octopus' legs.<br/><br/>Therefore, we came to say "tako kaina," which means "is it an octopus?," after "chu chu."

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese adjective "shira jira shii."<br/><br/>Both of the "shira" and the "jira" means "white," so this adjective can literally mean that something looks white.<br/><br/>However, in most cases, it means that someone's lie is blatant or someone pretend to know nothing about what he/her knows.<br/><br/>Usage example: Don't say the bland flattery (shirajira shii oseji).<br/><br/>Originally, "shiro" (white) is often used to imply that something is clear.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is thought that "shirajira shii" was derived from the meaning that your true feelings are clear.<br/><br/>Incidentally, according to my dictionary, "to tell a 'shirajira shii' lie" is translated into "to lie through one's teeth."

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese adjective "shoboi."<br/><br/>"Shoboi" means that someone/something is shabby or dull.<br/><br/>This word is an adjective form of the onomatopoeic word "shobo shobo."<br/><br/>Nowadays "shobo shobo" means that someone/something is drowsy or flabby, but in the Edo period, it mainly meant to rain kittens and puppies continuously.<br/><br/>The continuous drizzle is dismal, so "shobo shobo" came to have the meaning of "drowsy," and the current meaning of "shoboi."<br/><br/>Incidentally, you can use "shoboi" as an exclamation, like "shobo'!"<br/><br/>However, note that "shoboi" is, if anything, a slang term that is used young people.

Yesterday, adoption results of kakenhi were published.<br/><br/>"Kakenhi" is one of the most famous competitive research funds in Japan.<br/><br/>Although my previous application was rejected, I brushed up the it and applied almost the same theme again.<br/><br/>If this application were also rejected, I would receive the fact that my theme has no value, and consider changing the theme.<br/><br/>Therefore, I was pretty nervous.<br/><br/>However, my application was adopted and research funding will be paid, so I am very happy now.<br/><br/>I have been spent poor research life so far, but I will somewhat be better financially in the future.

Yesterday, I talked about "kakashi," which is used for driving annoying animals away.<br/><br/>Today I will talk about "shishiodoshi," which was used for the same purpose as kakashi.<br/><br/>"Shishiodoshi" is a tool that generates a sound automatically by water power.<br/><br/>First, it draws water into a bamboo tube.<br/><br/>When the the bamboo tube is filled with water, it inclines, the water discharges, and the tube becomes empty.<br/><br/>The bamboo tube returns to the original angle, then it strikes a rock or something, and make a sound.<br/><br/>"Shishi" means "deer," "odoshi" means "to terrify something," and "shishiodoshi" originally used for terrifying deer or annoying animals as the name implies.<br/><br/>However, in recent years, we have come to enjoy the gracious sound, and it is often placed at Japanese gardens.

Today I will talk about the Japanese word "kakashi."<br/><br/>"Kakashi" is a doll made of bamboo or straw -- it is put in a field to drive destructive animals like birds off. <br/><br/>It is thought that this word comes from the verbal noun "kagashi," which means to make someone smell at something.<br/><br/>This is because in the past, we drove animals off with a bad smell generated by burning meat or hair.<br/><br/>Nowadays, balloons that mimic huge eyes are used as kakashi, taking advantage of an animal instinct that they fear big eyes.<br/><br/>Incidentally, "kakasi" by Masashi Sada is a nice song that remind us of our parents' loves, so please listen it if you have time.

Since today is April Fool, I will talk about the origin.<br/><br/>As you know, April 1st, April Fool is a day that you can lie.<br/><br/>There are several theories about the origin of April Fool, but the truth remains unclear.<br/><br/>The widely accepted theory among them is something like the following:<br/><br/>In the past in European countries, New Year's Day was March 25th, and spring festivals were held until April 1st.<br/><br/>However, in 1564, Charles IX de France adopted a new calendar that defined that New Year's Day is January 1st.<br/><br/>Some people who rebelled against it regarded April 1st as "Fake New Year's Day," and came to tell a lie and get  into mischief.

Yesterday, I talked about the Japanese word "kichomen," which means that someone is well-organized in every detail.<br/><br/>Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "zubora." which has the opposite meaning to the "kichomen."<br/><br/>"Zubora" means that someone is loose and dissolute.<br/><br/>Usage example: Kare wa zubora na seikaku da. (His personality is zubora (loose).)<br/><br/>This word comes from dialect terms "zun bera bon," "zun bora bon" or "zuberabo," which means that something is flat.<br/><br/>There is also another theory -- it comes from a term in rice markets, "zubora," which meant that rice prices are continuous falling.

Today I will talk about one of Minor Offenses Act in Japan, "sin-nyugu keitai no tsumi," the literal meaning of which is "a charge of carrying invasive instruments."<br/><br/>This law says that you have not to carry instruments that are used for home-invasion without justifiable causes.<br/><br/>In the text, spare keys, chisels and glass cutters are mentioned, but many other items fall under the category.<br/><br/>For example, screw drivers, pliers, nippers, files, penlights, and flashlights.<br/><br/>The point we should notice is that you can be accused of a crime if you have a penlight or a flashlight.<br/><br/>In fact, about a month ago, a man who carried a flashlight was arrested in Japan.

Today I will talk about the Japanese word "chanbara."<br/><br/>"Chanbara" means a sword fight, and is used as a term for movies and plays.<br/><br/>This word comes from an onomatopoeia, "chanchan barabara," which implies a sound of clashing and clanging of swords.<br/><br/>Also, a play that children imitate swordplay scenes of movies is often referred to as "chabnara."<br/><br/>During the 1960s, historical movies became popular and "chanbara" was one of most popular plays among children.<br/><br/>Nowadays, sport chanbara (supochan) was generated, and has been played by some people in various countries.<br/><br/>According to the Internet, there are about 370 thousands players in the world.

Today was the graduation day of a university that I graduated from.<br/><br/>Therefore I went there and met my former teacher and his laboratory's students.<br/><br/>However, it was the first time to meet some students because they came to the laboratory after I graduated.<br/><br/>We talked about various things but we may not meet again in the future.<br/><br/>In Japan, such encounting, and giving importance to such encounters are called "ichigo ichie."<br/><br/>"Ichigo" of "ichigo ichie" is a Budhism term that means "your entire life," and "ichie" means "to meet once."<br/><br/>Since this is a lovely proverb, please remember it.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the four-character idiom "一日千秋 (ichijitsu senshu)."<br/><br/>"Ichijitsu senshu" means that you can't wait to something and feel like a long time.<br/><br/>The "ichijitsu" of "ichijitsu senshu" means "a day," abd the "senshu" means "a thousand autumn," that is, this idiom implies that you feel as if a day is a thousand year.<br/><br/>The reason why "autumn" is used rather than "spring" or "winter" is because "autumn" is the harvest season, and the kanji character could mean time/term. <br/><br/>Incidentally, this was derived from the Chinese idiom "一日三秋 (ichijitsu sanshu)," which has the same meaning.<br/>(Where "sanshu" means "three autumn.")

Today a graduation ceremony took place at my university.<br/><br/>Students who would graduate were wearing hakama (Japanese skirts or culottes) or suits, and they looked excited.<br/><br/>The graduation ceremony ended in the morning, and the conferment of degree was conducted at each laboratory from the afternoon.<br/><br/>After that we took pictures with everybody, and each of us made some comments, then my boss and I presented memorabilia to the students. <br/><br/>I was about to cry due to the reaction of the students, but I bit the inside of my cheeks.<br/><br/>The day when students that I taught for one year as a teacher graduated and got out into the world was deeply emotional for me.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "mejiro oshi."<br/><br/>"Mejiro" means "Japanese white-eye," "oshi" means "to push," and "Mejiro oshi" means that many people or things get crowded.<br/><br/>This word comes from the habit of the bird "mejiro" (Japanese white-eye).<br/><br/>"Mejiro" lines up without gaps on a tree branch from autumn to winter. <br/><br/>That scene is called "mejiro no oshiai" (pushing by mejiro).<br/><br/>Also, a play that children push each other while lining up came to be called "mejiro oshi," then it came to have the current meaning.<br/><br/>Incidentally, "me" of "mejiro" means "eyes," and "jiro" means "white."<br/><br/>The etymology is that they have white circles around their eyes.

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "futsutsuka."<br/><br/>"Futsutsuka" means that someone is inexperienced or insensitive due to lack of his/her ability or education.<br/><br/>It is said that this term comes from "futotsuka" -- where "futo" means "thick" and "tsuka" means "bulk." <br/><br/>In the past, it literally meant that something is thick and sturdy.<br/><br/>However, during the Heian period, aesthetic sense of delicate was widely spread in Japan.<br/><br/>Therefore, "futsutsuka" came to mean that thick things are unromantic, then it came to have the current meanings.<br/><br/>Also, we often calle such people "futsutsuka mono" ("mono" means "person").

Yesterday, I ate "hitsumabushi"that is a regional dish of Nagoya city.<br/><br/>I will eat hitsumabushi again tonight.<br/><br/>Hitsumabushi is a dish that is made by dusting rice with finely chopped eels.<br/><br/>This dish is famous for enjoying three different tastes by scooping rice and eels into a bowl three times.<br/><br/>You eat it as normal for the first time, eat it with seasonings such as green onions or wasabi for the second time, and eat it with green tea or soup stock for the third time.<br/><br/>It is said that it came to be known as hitsumabushi because it was made by dusting (called "mabusu" in Japanese) rice in a pot (called "hitsu" in Japanese) with eels.

Today I went to an academic conference and listened students' presentations.<br/><br/>Sometimes I felt a kind of frightening, but they all somehow finished their presentation, so I was relieved.<br/><br/>After all of today's sessions finished, we went to a museum of science and enjoyed the world's largest planetarium.<br/><br/>Since it was quite beautiful, and I was moved I almost cried.<br/><br/>After that, we ate various local foods like hitsumabushi, tebasaki (chicken wing tips), etc.<br/><br/>They were very delicious.<br/><br/>Hitsumabushi is an eel dish that is mainly eaten in Nagoya city, Aichi prefecture.<br/><br/>Tomorrow, I will write an article about hitsumabushi.

An academic conference will be held at a university located in my hometown from tomorrow.<br/><br/>In order to participate in the conference, I went back to my hometown today.<br/><br/>Here, I used the word "帰省 (kisei)" in my sentences of native language version to mean to go back to my hometown.<br/><br/>Currently, it is not a mistake to say something like what I write.<br/><br/>However, '帰 (ki)' of "kisei" means to go back to your hometown, and "省" means to think about your family.<br/><br/>Therefore, thinking based on the original meaning, my sentence would be wrong.

Today I participated in an academic conference.<br/><br/>Several students that I taught planned to do their poster presentations, and I planned to go the venue as an accompanying person of them.<br/><br/>However, two of them were absent, so I had to do poster presentations on behalf of them.<br/><br/>Since one poster session took one and a half hours, I explained their studies patiently for a total of three hours.<br/><br/>Now I am a state of "heto heto."<br/><br/>"Heto heto" is a term that means an exhausted condition,  but the etymology isn't clear.<br/><br/>A theory insists that "heto heto" comes from the last two characters of "i ro ha ni ho he to," which is a traditional Japanese poem called "Iroha Uta."

Today I would like to talk about the expression "moshi moshi," which is often used on a daily basis.<br/><br/>"Moshi moshi" is used when you want to address someone, especially make a call.<br/><br/>This expression comes from a verb "mousu," which means "to talk from now."<br/><br/>Formerly, "mousu mousu" and "moushimasu moushimasu" were used by repeating "mousu," but now it's called "moshi moshi" for short.<br/><br/>Incidentally, another expression "oi oi" was used when telephones were opened at first in Japan.<br/><br/>However, since "oi oi" was a little rude expression used by men, before long it was no longer in use.<br/>

I bought a wrist watch at an outlet mall yesterday.<br/><br/>It was a little expensive, but I'm quite satisfied because I could bought my favorite design on sale.<br/><br/>According to the British institution YouGov, more than half of people between 16 to 34 use mobile phones as a way of knowing the time.<br/><br/>Also, according to a questionnaire survey by a Japanese company, about one third business people between 20s to 30s go work without wearing watches.<br/><br/>It is thought that the number of young people who don't wear watches has rapidly increased due to the spread of mobile phones.<br/><br/>In fact, I normally didn't wear a watch very much.<br/><br/>However, recently somehow I came to have an urge of wearing good watches.<br/><br/>Someday I would like to buy a more classy watch.

Today I will talk about the Japanese word "neko," which means "cat."<br/><br/>There are several etymologies, but widely accepted ones are the following:<br/><br/>・Abbreviation of "nekoma"<br/><br/>It is said that originally neko was called "nekoma," and it became to "neko" for short.<br/><br/>As the reason why it was called nekoma, there are several theories -- one is that "ma," which means "beast" was attached to "neko," which is an abbreviation of "yoku neru ko" (a child who get a good sleep) .<br/><br/>・Deformation of the sound of a cat<br/><br/>Formerly in Japan, we referred to the sound of a cat as "neu neu."<br/><br/>It is also said that by attaching "ko," which is a suffix word that represents familiarity, to the "ne" of "neu neu," the word "neko" was born.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "sanbyoshi sorou."<br/><br/>The literal meanings is "three beats get together," and it means that three or all necessary conditions are equipped.<br/><br/>In Nou music, a traditional Japanese art, three percussion instruments are used -- kozutsumi (small hand drum), ookawa (knee drum), and taiko (stick drum).<br/><br/>When beats by these instruments get together, a good harmonious performance is given, so this term was born.<br/><br/>For example, if you use this term for a baseball player, it will mean that the player has three excellent abilities -- running, batting, and defence.<br/><br/>This word is often used as good meanings, but you can use it to mean bad elements, such as drinking, gambling, and trafficking women.

Today I will talk about the Japanese phrase "kechon kechon."<br/><br/>"Kechon kechon" means to harm or punish someone thoroughly.<br/><br/>It is said that this word comes from a dialect of Wakayama prefecture "kechoni," meaning "very" or "extremely." <br/><br/>There are several etymologies of "kechoni" -- it comes from "kechi," meaning "stingy," comes from a word of the Genji Monogatari in Heian period, and so on, but the correct derivation has not been cleared yet.<br/><br/>Also, when the dialect "kechoni" spread all over Japan, it came to changed "kechon kechon."<br/><br/>"Kechon kechon" is a little violent expression, but I thinkt the sound is cute.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "akkanbe."<br/><br/>"Akkabe" is used when you want to tease or provoke someone, and it is often accompanied by a physical action.<br/><br/>Specifically, the action is that you pull your lower eyelid down, and put your tongue out.<br/><br/>Originally, it was "akame," which means "red eye," because a red region of your eye is exposed when you pull your eyelid down.<br/><br/>Then it came to change to "akanbe" or "akkanbe."<br/><br/>Note that this expression is basically used by children.<br/><br/>Incidentally, according to my dictionary, "akanbe" is translated into "to cock a snook" :-P

Today I'd like to talk about the Japanese phrase "mi mo futa mo nai."<br/><br/>"Mi mo futa mo nai" means that your expression is brutally honest, and it contain neither connotations nor feelings.<br/><br/>It also means to end talk due to such a frank expression.<br/><br/>"Mi" means "container," "futa" means "lid," so the literal meaning of "mi mo futa mo nai" is "there is neither containers nor lids."<br/><br/>If there is neither container nor lids, the contents will be exposed.<br/><br/>Based on this thought, "mi mo futa mo nai" came to mean that something is too frank or brutally honest.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "naruhodo."<br/><br/>"Naruhodo" is a helpful phrase that is used when you express your thought of agreeing or satisfying with someone's opinion.<br/><br/>"Naru" of "naruhodo" means "establish," "hodo" means "limit," and "naruhodo" originally meant "as much as possible."<br/><br/>It is thought that this became to mean "obvious," then changed to the meaning of "indeed."<br/><br/>Incidentally, there is an Internet slang phrase (joke) "naruhodo, wakaran," which means "I see, I don't understand."<br/><br/>This phrase is used when you can't understand expositions due to difficult terms/phrases, even if they are explained in detail.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "bibiru."<br/><br/>"Bibiru" means to be scared or feel intimidated.<br/><br/>We often regard this word as a slang term that is used by young people, but actually this word has been used since the Heian period.<br/><br/>Originally, "bibiru" was "bibiru oto" (bibiru sound), and it referred to chattering sounds arising from armors when numerous army moved.<br/>(The onomatopoeia of the sound was "binbin.")<br/><br/>Also, it is said that an army ran away by considering sounds of birds flying off at once as enemy's "bibiru sound."<br/><br/>From this story, "bibiru" became to be used to mean to be scared.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the slang term "クビ (kubi)."<br/><br/>"クビ" is Katakana form of a kanji character "首," which means "neck," and if you write the kanji in Katakana or Hiragana, it often means "dismissal/displacement."<br/><br/>For example: <br/>"Kubi ni natta." (This literal meaning is "I became a neck," and it expressed "I was fired.") <br/><br/>"Kimi wa kubi da." (This literal meaning is "You are a neck," and it expressed "You're fired.")<br/><br/>In the Edo period in Japan, criminals were cut their necks using Japanese swords.<br/><br/>By identifying such executions with displacements, "kubi wo kiru" (to cut a neck) came to mean to dismiss someone.<br/><br/>Furthermore, just "kubi" (neck) came to mean "dismissal."<br/><br/>I think that these terms are similar to "get axed" or "get the ax" in English.

Today I will talk about the slang term "butsu."<br/><br/>"Butsu" is one of pronunciations of "物," which means "things," and it is used as a pronoun to indicate some kind of things literally<br/><br/>When you want to refer to general things, "物" is read as "mono," but if you read it as "butsu" in on-yomi (Chinese readings), it will mean "antisocial things" or "illegal things" in most cases.<br/><br/>For example, there are drugs, stimulants, guns, and etc. as subjects that are called "butsu."<br/><br/>Also, "薬," which means drugs or medicine, is usually read as "kusuri," but if you read it as "yaku" in on-yomi, it will especially mean illicit drugs or stimulants.

Today I will talk about the Japanese Internet slang term "pochiru."<br/><br/>"Pochiru" means to press a buy button on online shopping stores.<br/><br/>Usage example: "Amazon de Kindle wo pochitta." (I bought a Kindle on Amazon.)<br/><br/>In Japanese, there is an onomatopoeic word "pochi," that is used when you press a button or switch.<br/><br/>"Pochiru" was born by attaching "ru" to "pochi," where "ru" is the suffix word which verbalizes substantives.<br/>(Therefore, "pochi" is written in Katakana and "ru" is written in Hiragana, like ポチる.)<br/><br/>According to this origin, "pochiru" should mean to press a button, but in most cases, it refers to buy goods on the Internet.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Day before yesterday, the number of entries on Lang-8 reached 800.<br/><br/>Thus I posted the 801st entry yesterday.<br/><br/>The number "801" is sometimes used to mean products for women focusing on homosexuality between male characters.<br/><br/>In this case, "801" is called "yaoi."<br/><br/>This word is composed of initial characters of three elements that frequently occurs in doujinshi (coterie magazine) -- "Yama-nashi (No peak)," "Ochi-nashi (No fall)," and "Imi-nashi (No meaning)." <br/><br/>Originally it expressed only poor quality manga, and didn't contain homosexual meaning.<br/><br/>However, recently it has changed to a word that mainly means products of boys' love.<br/><br/>I think that "801" is similar to "slash fiction" in the West.

Yesterday was Premium Friday.<br/><br/>Premium Friday is a day for prompting personal consumption that was advocated by the Japanese government and financial circles.<br/><br/>Specifically, it is recommended that you finish your work at 3 p.m. on month-end Friday, and enjoy shopping or traveling from the evening.<br/><br/>In that day, many restaurants and travel agencies practiced various discount campaigns.<br/><br/>Yesterday, February 24, 2017 was the first enforcement day of Premium Friday, and it will be enforced once two months, six times a year.<br/><br/>As a side note, I participated in a meeting from 3 p.m yesterday -- I had nothing to do with that day at all.

<div class="date" hidden>Feb 24, 2017 12:15</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese slang "tameguchi."<br/><br/>"Tameguchi" means a way of talking that doesn't contain polite expressions in Japanese conversation.<br/><br/>Originally "tame" was a gambling term that meant repeated digits on dice, and it came to be used to mean "equal basis" or "same age" among young people since around 1960s.<br/><br/>By attaching "kuchi," meaning a way of talking, to the "tame," the slang "tameguchi" was born. <br/><br/>Recently in Japan, the number of young people who can't use polite expressions appropriately is increasing.<br/><br/>Please be careful not to use "tameguchi" to older people and strangers.

Today I will talk about the Japanese word "detarame."<br/><br/>"Detarame" means incoherent, disorganized, or irresponsible things.<br/><br/>This word has been used since the Edo period, and it is thought that this was derived from gambling using dice.<br/><br/>The theory is something like the following:<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "me" of "detarame" is "eyes," and it means the number of spots on dice.<br/><br/>Also, "detarame" is the abbreviation form of "detara sono me," which means "depending on the number of spots on dice."<br/><br/>That is to say, it expresses that you say/do something irresponsible depending on dice.<br/><br/>It can be written as "出鱈目" in kanji, but "鱈" (meaning Pacific cod) is a phonetic equivalent, and fish isn't related to this word.

Today I will talk about the Japanese idiom "zu ni noru."<br/><br/>"Zu ni noru" means to get carried away or get cocky.<br/><br/>Where "zu" means modulation in a Buddhist hymn "seinmyo," and "noru" means "to ride."<br/><br/>Originally, "zu ni noru" meant to change modulation well while reciting the hymn.<br/><br/>Since the modulation was difficult, it came to mean that things go well, then it has come to have the current meanings described above.<br/><br/>Both "zu ni noru" and "choshi ni noru" ("choshi" means "condition") have the similar meaning like "get carried away," but "zu ni noru" is mainly used in bad meaning, while "choshi ni noru" is used both good and bad meanings.

Today I will talk about the relationship between mice and cheese.<br/><br/>In various animations, manga, and plays, you can see a scene that mice like cheese.<br/><br/>However, according to a study at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK, mice avoid cheese unless they are starving.<br/><br/>Since mice have a high metabolic rate, they prefer grain, fruits, and sweets that contain a lot of sugar.<br/><br/>Also, it is thought that mice dislike food that have a strong fermentation odor like cheese because of their keen olfactory sense.<br/><br/>Although there are several theories as the reason why we think that mice like cheese, there is no widely accepted one.

Today I will talk about a tool called "yakan."<br/><br/>Yakan is a kettle-shaped tool that is used for boiling water.<br/>(Incidentally, my dictionary says "yakan" is "kettle" or "boiler.")<br/><br/>Stainless, steel, aluminum or copper is often used as a material.<br/><br/>The yakan, which appeared in the Kamakura Period, was originally used to simmer drugs.<br/><br/>Therefore, the name became "yakan" -- 'ya' means 'medicine' and 'kan' means 'pod'.<br/><br/>It is not clear when yakan came to be used a tool for boiling water.<br/><br/>The roots of huetsuki yakan (kettle with whistle) that are often used these days seems to be ones that were released by a kitchenware manufacturer in New York in 1921.

Today I will talk about the Japanese word "dosakusa."<br/><br/>"Dosakusa" means a situation that people are confused by sudden incidents or errands. <br/><br/>In most cases, it is used with "magirete," which means "to blend into something", something like "dosakusa ni magirete ~ suru" (to do something in the confusion).<br/><br/>Usage example: Dosakusa ni magirete party kara kaeru. (I escape from the party in the confusion.)<br/><br/>Some people say that this word comes from "bakuto gari" (to hunt gamblers), which was conducted to get workers at Sado Kinzan in the Edo period.<br/><br/>In this theory, "dosa" is a changed form of "sado," and "kusa" comes from "kusai," which means "to be sound like something" -- that is, "dosakusa" indicates a confusion of a gambling parlor in Sado Kinzan.<br/><br/>However, nowadays this thought is regarded as a vulgar belief.

Today I will talk about the Japanese food "daifuku."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of 大福 (daifuku) is "big lucky", and it is a kind of Japanese sweets that wrap azuki-an (a sweet red paste made from red azuki beans) in mochi (sticky rice cake).<br/><br/>During the Muromachi Period, such mochi sweets were called "uzura mochi" (quail mochi) because of its shape.<br/><br/>Also, since uzura mochi was big and gave you the feeling of long fullness, it was also called "腹太餅 (harabuto mochi)," where '腹 (hara)' means 'belly' and '太 (buto)' means 'large').<br/><br/>During the Edo Period, harabuto mochi became smaller, and it became to be called "大福餅 (daifuku mochi)," where '大 (dai)' means 'big' and '腹 (fuku)' means 'belly'.<br/><br/>Finally, the auspicious letter '福 (fuku),' meaning 'lucky,' came to be used instead of '腹,' and it became '大福 (daifuku)' or "大福餅 (daifuku mochi)."

Today I will talk about prairie dogs that are belong to the squirrel family.<br/><br/>Prairie dogs are inhabit the grasslands of North America -- they make burrow and live in there in flocks.<br/><br/>The social of them is polygamy, and the family groups are called "coteries".<br/><br/>Coteries are live in the same burrow, share feed, and kick out males who came from outside.<br/><br/>They build strong camaraderie among coteries.<br/><br/>It is also known that they kiss and hug to each other when greeting.<br/><br/>Incidentally, burrows made by prairie dogs are divided into a bed room, a children's room, a toilet, a pantry, a managing room, and so on depending on the role.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "kattarui."<br/><br/>"Kattarui" means "to feel sluggish" or "to feel lazy."<br/><br/>This word was derived from "kahina dayushi," which is a word used in Heian Era.<br/><br/>"Kahina" of "kahina dayushi" means "arm," and "dayushi" means "to feel sluggish."<br/><br/>The word "kahina dayushi" changed to "kahidarushi," "kahidarui," then "kattarui."<br/><br/>That is to say, "kattarui" originally meant "to feel sluggish/lazy because of tired arms."<br/><br/>It came to mean not only "arm" but also "body," and finally it came to have the above meanings.<br/><br/>Incidentally, my dictionary says that "kattarui" can be translated into just "tiring."

Unfortunately  I have caught a cold.<br/><br/>I have a sore throat and a headache, and feel a chill.<br/><br/>So today I will talk about trivia about a cold.<br/><br/>More than 90% of common colds are caused by virus infection.<br/><br/>The number of virus types is more than 800, and medicines that suppress these viruses hasn't been developed yet.<br/><br/>Doctors prescribe might medicines for you, but they only have an effect to suppress the symptoms.<br/><br/>Since such medicines have also adverse effects, many doctors and pharmacists heal on its own when they catch a cold.<br/><br/>Incidentally, if you can develop a specific medicine for colds, no doubt you win the Nobel Prize.

Today is Valentine's Day.<br/><br/>On this day men in many countries present bouquets, cakes or chocolate to women.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in some countries such as Japan or Korea, women present chocolate to men they love.<br/><br/>For this reason, a large amount of chocolate has been sold in supermarkets lately.<br/><br/>Incidentally, chocolate of Valentine's Day in Japan is able to be divided into several categories.<br/><br/>"Honmei choco" (Main chocolate) ･･･ A chocolate that is presented as a confession of love.<br/><br/>"Giri choco" (Obligation chocolate) ･･･ A chocolate that is presented as an expression of thanks or social etiquette.<br/><br/>"Tomo choco" (Friend choco) ･･･ Chocolate that are presented to each other among women.<br/><br/>"Gyaku choco" (Reverse chocolate) ･･･ A chocolate that is presented from a man to a woman.<br/><br/>Today I'm going to present chocolate to some colleague as a souvenir, so I need to explain the chocolate is unrelated to Valentine's Day.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Last week I bought a lot of chocolate.<br/><br/>However, since I didn't know where the word 'chocolate' came from, today I searched the etymology on the Internet.<br/><br/>First, the word 'chocolate' comes from Spanish.<br/><br/>The Spanish word 'chocolate' comes from a Nahuatl word 'xocolatl'.<br/><br/>Here, 'xocoli' means 'bitter' and 'atl' means 'water'.<br/><br/>Since the sound 'xo' didn't exist in Spanish, it has come to be 'cho'.<br/><br/>Originally, chocolate was treated as a medical drink among native Mexicans, and it was neither solid nor sweet.<br/><br/>It has spread to all over the world, continuously improved, then chocolate has become the feature like today.

Last week I wrote diaries related to my overseas business trip.<br/><br/>I will talk about Japanese words and culture again from this week.<br/><br/>Yesterday, February 11st was "Kenkoku Kinen no Hi" (National Foundation Day), which is a national holiday in Japan.<br/><br/>The purpose of this day is to commemorate the founding of Japan and to foster a love for Japan.<br/><br/>It is said that Emperor Jimmu, the first emperor of Japan, was crowned in this day.<br/><br/>However, this story is based on Japanese mythology, and the exact day when Japan was founded is unknown.<br/><br/>In cases where you don't know the exact day like this, the name of the national holiday becomes "kinen no hi," instead of "kinenbi."<br/><br/>I think that many Japanese people misunderstand this day as "kenkoku kinenbi."

Today was the final day of the international conference.<br/><br/>I felt bad from a hangover, but I went to the venue and listened presentations from the morning.<br/><br/>After lunch, I went out to buy chocolates with a small sightseeing.<br/><br/>The shop is "Demeestere" located in an outskirt of Leuven, and I found a rumor that the chocolates are really tasty on the Internet.<br/><br/>It had a very good atmosphere, and I inadvertently bought a lot of chocolates (around 150 euro).<br/><br/>Then I came back to the conference, and after it finished, other Japanese participants and I went to Brussels for sightseeing.<br/><br/>First we went to Grand Place, then saw famous Mannequin Piss, walked around Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert, buy chocolates, and ate waffles.<br/><br/>It was a very fulfill day.

Today was Day 2 of the international conference, and it was the day of my presentation.<br/><br/>I was super nervous and I thought I was going to vomit..<br/><br/>Then finally, the presentation was performed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I couldn't speak well.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the question and answer session was really awful.<br/><br/>I was sad.<br/><br/>After the presentation, I acted with other Japanese participants.<br/><br/>In a reception of the conference, cheeses were all-you-can-eat and many kinds of beer were all-you-can-drink.<br/><br/>While listening to live performance of string instruments, we got a lot of delicious beer and cheese.<br/><br/>However, since I drank beer too much, I have a head ache.

Today I participated in a conference that has been held in Belgium.<br/><br/>Since my presentation is Day 2, I prepared my talk while watching other presenters' talk.<br/><br/>Sadly, I couldn't understand most of the contents of many presentations.<br/><br/>In particular, since people speak quickly in question and answer parts, I became very nervous.<br/><br/>I can't imagine that I survive the question and answer part.<br/><br/>Now I really want to throw out my presentation and run away to somewhere.<br/><br/>However, today I was able to be talk with other Japanese participants for a short time, so I felt a little relieved.

Today I was moving almost all day.<br/><br/>It took about twenty-one hours from Tokyo to Brussels via Dubai.<br/><br/>I ate airplane food four times in total.<br/><br/>And now, I finally arrived at Leuven, then checked into a hotel with no accident.<br/><br/>I am very very tired but really relieved.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I couldn't prepare my presentation in the airplane very much, I have to finish it in this hotel from now.<br/><br/>I walked this town only from the station to the hotel, but I felt Leuven was very beautiful location.<br/><br/>I'd like to go sightseeing slowly after the conference is over.

Today I prepared my luggage from the morning and departed for Narita Airport by limousine bus around noon.<br/><br/>After I arrived at Narita Airport around the evening,  changed some Japanese yen to euro, then ate seafood rice bowl.<br/><br/>Although here is Japan, it is an airport, so I hear foreign languages from various places.<br/><br/>When I heard a fluent English conversation, I thought that it is impossible for me, then I felt uneasy.<br/><br/>I am nervous whether or not my clumsy English would convey the meaning in Belgium.<br/><br/>By the way, I am now making my presentation material at the airport lounge because there was a lot of time till check-in time of my flight.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "hebi-geiko."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "hebi" is "snake," "geiko" means "enrichment lesson," and "hebi-geiko" means that someone quits enrichment lessons soon.<br/><br/>Usage example: Don't do hebi-geiko (Don't quit something easily).<br/><br/>Snakes are a creature that hibernates during autumn and winter, and starts activities in spring.<br/><br/>We thought that a person who started something in spring and ends in autumn was similar to the snake, then the term "hebi-geiko" was born.<br/><br/>Incidentally, there is another idiom called "mikka bozu, " which has the almost similar meaning of "hebi-geiko."<br/><br/>You can see the etymology in the following article.<br/><br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/146010804523318607706596508768806929454" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/146010804523318607706596508768806929454</a>

Yesterday I talked about the Japanese word "iro-otoko," which mean a good-looking man or a ladies' man.<br/><br/>Today I'd like to talk about the word "otoko-mae," which means a manly look or attitude.<br/><br/>"Otoko" in "otoko-mae" means a man and "mae" means "front."<br/><br/>Here, "mae" can make a noun that expresses a function or state of something by attaching after another noun.<br/><br/>For example, there is "ude-mae" (ude means an arm and ude-mae means skill.)<br/><br/>Originally, "otoko-mae" means something like the role of a man.<br/><br/>However, now it usually means that someone is nice as a man, that is, someone has a manly look or attitude.

Today I will talk about the Japanese word "iro-otoko."<br/><br/>"Iro-otoko" means a good-looking man, a lascivious man or a man who is popular with women.<br/><br/>Since "iro" means "lascivious" (also means "color") and "otoko" means "man,"  "iro-otoko" originally meant only a womanizer.<br/><br/>During the Edo period, it came to mean a good-looking man and a popular man.<br/><br/>It is thought that such a change of meanings is derived from Kabuki.<br/><br/>In Kabuki, an actor who played a love scene as a role of a beautiful man (called "nuregotoshi") had his face painted white.<br/><br/>From this fact, "nuregotoshi" came to be called "iro-otoko," then came to have the above meanings.

Yesterday I talked about the Japanese word "beppin," which means a beautiful woman.<br/><br/>Today I'm going to talk about the word "suppin," which was derived from "beppin."<br/><br/>"Suppin" means a person (mainly a woman) who wearing no makeup at all.<br/><br/>This originally meant that a woman is beautiful even if she doesn't makeup.<br/><br/>However, it has been used for meaning to appear on stage without wearing makeup in the Kabuki world.<br/><br/>Recently the meaning has spread publicly from the Kabuki.<br/><br/>"Suppin" is also used as a word that expresses a state of no job in Final Fantasy and a state of no ability in Kirby Super Star.

Today I will talk about the Japanese word "beppin," which means a beautiful woman.<br/><br/>It is said that this word comes from a signboard of an eel restaurant in Aichi Prefecture.<br/><br/>During the Edo period, eel dishes came to be popular, and the restaurant hung out a sign that was written as "sukoburu beppin," which means "very different item."<br/><br/>(Here "beppin" is an abbreviation for "betsu no shina," which means "other item.")<br/><br/>This changed to just "beppin," and came to be used to mean an outstanding person.<br/><br/>And now it is used as a word that means only a beautiful woman.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about a Japanese superstition.<br/><br/>"Yoru ni tsume wo kiru to oya no shinime ni aenai" (If you cut your nails at night, you won't be with your parents when they pass away).<br/><br/>Like this, it is thought that to cut your nails at night is something bad in Japan.<br/><br/>I will introduce two theories that are thought of as the derivation.<br/><br/>【Because it was dangerous】<br/>Formerly in Japan, people cut their nails using a small knife. Furthermore, since there were no light bulbs, it was very dark at night. As a result, some cut their hands wrongly and some were dead because of the mistakes.<br/><br/>【Because it could bring bad luck】<br/>By omitting "yoru ni tsume wo kiru" (to cut your nails at night), it becomes "夜爪 (yozume)," (night nails). This is associated with "世詰め (yozume)," which means "short-lived."

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "nureginu."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "wet clothes," and it means "innocent sins" or "unfounded rumors."<br/><br/>When you want to mean "to accuse someone of falsely," you can say "nureginu wo kiseru" by using the verb "kiru," which means "to wear."<br/><br/>Originally, "nureginu" meant "clothes wetted by water."<br/><br/>There are some theories about the etymology, and one of them comes from the following old story:<br/><br/>A stepmother envied the beauty of husband's daughter by a previous marriage, and she put a wet cloth of a fisherman who lived nearby in the daughter's room.<br/><br/>The daughter's father looked the cloth, and he was misled into thinking that she stole the fisherman's cloth, then he killed his daughter.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese idiom "abura ga noru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to put on fat," and it means that someone gets into the full swing of his/her work, or someone is in the prime as a man/woman.<br/><br/>Usage example: Recently his work has put on fat (he has gotten into the full swing of his work). It is said that men put on fat (men are in the prime of manhood) at around age 35.<br/><br/>Originally, this idiom has been used for fish or birds.<br/><br/>The amount of fat included in fish and birds increases depending on the season, then the taste improves.<br/><br/>From this fact, "abura ga noru" (to put on fat) came to mean that something/someone gets better.

Andesu melons (アンデスメロン)  are sold in Japanese markets.<br/><br/>You might think that this melon is related to Andes Mountains or Andean something from this name.<br/><br/>However, the andesu melon is a kind of melon that was developed by a Japanese company, and it is not related to Andes mountains at all.<br/><br/>Since this melon is easy to grow and you can feel relieved, it was originally planned to be sold as "Anshindesu melon" ("anshin" means "to feel relieved").<br/><br/>However, it lacked a sense of humor.<br/><br/>Also, since you would remove a melon core (that is called "しん (shin)" in Japanese) before eating it, "anshindesu melon" seemed to become "andesu melon" by removing "shin."

Today I will talk about the term "decchiage."<br/><br/>"Decchiage" means to make up a story as if it were actually happened.<br/><br/>Usage example: Kare no hanashi wa subete decchiage da (All his stories are hoaxes). Buyuden wo decchiageru (I cook my heroic story up).<br/><br/>This term comes from the Han reading of "捏" in "捏造 (netsuzo)," which has the same meaning of "decchiage."<br/><br/>The Han reading of "捏" is "detsu," and it came to be verbalized as "decchiageru," then it came to also be used as the noun form "decchiage."<br/><br/>By the way, the Hiragana form of "でつ (detsu)" looks like Snoopy.

There are "plus driver" and "minus driver" as screwdrivers in Japan.<br/><br/>Many Japanese people think that "driver" (screwdriver), "plus driver" and "minus driver" make sense.<br/><br/>However, in order to convey the meaning, first we have to use "screwdriver" instead of "driver."<br/><br/>Also, Japanese people often call "plus driver (screwdriver)" or "minus driver (screwdriver)" depending on the shape of the groove, but they might  not make sense.<br/><br/>We have to use "Phillips screwdriver" or "Frearson screwdriver" instead of "plus driver," and have to use "slotted screwdriver" or "flat head screwdriver" instead of "minus driver."<br/><br/>Incidentally, "minus screw" (slotted screw) is often used in places where it is prone to become tainted.

"Hitode" is a star-shaped creature, and it is said that star marks that are now commonly used comes from "hitode."<br/><br/>"Hitode" is "starfish" or "sea star" in English, "étoile de mer" (sea star) in French, "Seestern" (sea star) in German, and "海星" (sea star) in Chinese.<br/><br/>As just described, many countries has named after stars.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the literal meaning of "hitode" is "human's hand."<br/><br/>Since starfish's arms looked like human's hand, Japanese fishermen began calling like that.<br/><br/>Previously in a Japanese TV show, an interesting information related to starfish was introduced -- "Starfish can escape even if their bodies are all tied up with ropes."<br/><br/>You can see the validation video in the following link:<br/><br/>ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDbcajhnLoA

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese idom "ashimoto o miru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to look at feet," and it means to take unfair advantage of someone.<br/><br/>Former in Japan, on highway streets or lodgings, palanquin bearers and packhorse drivers observed traveler's feet.<br/><br/>They determined the traveler's tiredness and offered a ridiculous fee only for tired people.<br/><br/>Even if the fee was too expensive, the tired customer would pay it with half a heart.<br/><br/>From this reason, "ashimoto o miru" has become to mean "to take unfair advantage of someone."<br/><br/>It seems that idiom can be translated as "to find the length of someone's foot."

There is a famous superstition in Japan as the following:<br/><br/>"You will become a cow if you lie down soon after eating."<br/><br/>In fact, I was also taught like that.<br/><br/>I have no idea why it is a cow, but I think that it says "you will get fat like a cow."<br/><br/>Lying down soon after eating is regarded as a bad manner in Japan.<br/><br/>Therefore, in order to admonish such behavior, this superstition was born.<br/><br/>However, according to a medical study, lying down for about 30 minutes soon after eating is good for your health -- it will play a role in the digestive process.

Today I will talk about the Japanese word "noroma".<br/><br/>"Noroma" means a dull person or something dull.<br/><br/>It is said that this word comes from "Noroma ningyo" (Noroma doll) in "Ai Kyogen" (comic interludes), which was performed by a puppeteer called Noromatsu Kanbe.<br/><br/>The Noroma ningyo was a dubious doll that has a flat and pale face, and moves slowly.<br/><br/>The noun "noroma" was made from this fact, and a adjective "noroi" (dull) was also made. <br/><br/>By the way, "noroi" can be regarded as a noun, and in such a case, it means "curse".<br/><br/>"A dull curse" can be translated to into Japanese as "noroi noroi".

Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "kinakusai".<br/><br/>"Kinakusai" means that something or someone is dubious or fishy.<br/><br/>The original meaning of this term is "to smell like that papers or clothes are burnt".<br/><br/>"Kina" in "kinakusai" is said to have been changed from "kinu", which means clothes.<br/>("Kusai" means "to smell".)<br/><br/>Also, since burnt smells are something like a smell of gunpowder, "kinakusai" can mean an atmosphere that war is about to happen.<br/><br/>There meanings came to be expanded, then this term came to have the meaning mentioned at the beginning.<br/><br/>Even now you can express all of the above three meanings by "kinakusai".

Today I will talk about the phrase "nicchimo sacchimo ikanai".<br/><br/>"Nicchimo sacchimo ikanai" means that something/someone is completely pinned down.<br/><br/>This phrase comes from an abacus term "nshin-mo sanshin-mo".<br/><br/>"Nishin" means "two divided by two", "sanshin" means "three divided by three", and both of them can be calculated without remainder.<br/><br/>From these terms, "nishin-mo sanshin-mo ikanai" (both nishin and sanshin can't go well) came to express that a number can't be divided by 2 and 3, then it came to mean that a calculation with abacus doesn't go well.<br/><br/>Furthermore it came to mean that business doesn't go well, finally it came to mean the meaning mentioned at the beginning.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "mikka bozu".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "three days guy", and it means that someone gives up easily, or means such a person.<br/><br/>Usage example: Although he declared that he would post on Lang-8 every day and he got all fired up about that, he was mikka bozu (he quit easily).<br/><br/>In Buddhism, once you become a priest, you have to wake up in the early morning, and do strict training every day.<br/><br/>Since some of people who became priests quit the training and return to a secular life in three days, this term was made.

Yesterday I talked about the Japanese term "origami tsuki".<br/><br/>Today I will talk about the Japanese term "osumi tsuki", which is a little similar to the yesterday's one.<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "attached ink", and it means that something is accepted or guaranteed by a person in authority.<br/><br/>Originally, this term meant a document related to an acceptance or a guarantee of domains made by a general or a vassal lord in the Edo period.<br/><br/>Here, kao (written seal mark) is used as a signing, and it was written by sumi (ink).<br/><br/>Therefore, the document was called "osumi tsuki" (attached ink), and it came to have the current meaning.<br/><br/>By the way, basically "origami tsuki" is used for a thing, while "osumi tsuki" is used for a person.

Today I will talk about the Japanese term "origami tsuki".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "attached origami", and it means that something is guaranteed to have reliable quality.<br/><br/>Here, "origami" means a document that is folded in half, and it has been used as an official document or a catalog since the Heian period.<br/>(Note that this "origami" is not a traditional Japanese art of folding paper.)<br/><br/>In the Edo period, the "origami" came to be also used as a certificate that guarantees that art or katana (Japanese sword) is not fake.<br/><br/>Then, "origami tsuki" came to have the above meaning.

Today I will talk about the Japanese word "kuromaku".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "a black curtain", and it means "a person who gives instructions under the counter", or "a person who has real power".<br/><br/>This word comes from a tool that is used in Kabuki (traditional Japanese drama performed by male actors).<br/><br/>In the Kabuki, a black curtain is used for hiding the stage when the scene is changing, or showing a night scene.<br/><br/>Since operations of the stage were conducted behind the black curtain, "a person who has influence behind the curtain" came to be referred to as "kuromaku" (a black curtain).

Today is a national holiday called "Seijin no Hi" in Japan.<br/><br/>"Seijin no Hi" is held in order to congratulate and encourage all those who have become adults and are trying to become independent.<br/><br/>On this day, each municipality invites people who have reached 20 years old, and a coming-of-age ceremony is held.<br/><br/>New adults participate in the ceremony in full dress -- women wear furisode (long-sleeved kimono), and men wear hakama (formal men's divided skirt) or suits.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these days the number of new adults who cause problems in the coming-of-age ceremony increases.<br/><br/>In the last hour, I got the news that a new adult made a mess of the ceremony and was arrested.

Today I will talk about the Japanese event called "kokera otoshi".<br/><br/>"Kokera otoshi" is the first event that is held in a newly constructed theater as part of the opening festivities.<br/><br/>"Kokera" means chips of wood that are produced when cutting timber, and "otoshi" means "to drop".<br/><br/>After building a wooden building, we first brush down "kokera" that are left on the roof.<br/><br/>From this fact, the event which will be held for the first time after the theater is constructed came to be referred to as "kokera otoshi".<br/><br/>By the way, "kokera" is written as "杮" in kanji.<br/><br/>This kanji is really similar to "柿" (kaki) (which means "persimmons"), but it's different at the right part -- the vertical bar is connected in "杮" (kokera), while it's separated in "柿" (kaki).

Nowadays in Japan, the number of mask dependence increases.<br/><br/>They are always wearing dummy masks -- it is not hygienic reasons such as a prevention of a cold.<br/><br/>For example, the actual reasons are something like the following:<br/><br/>・To hide the face with no makeup<br/>・To hide complexes about their faces<br/>・To avoid talking with people<br/>・To avoid people's gaze<br/>・To avoid showing emotions<br/><br/>According to a survey, especially young women tend to be mask dependence.<br/><br/>I think that there is a social problem contributing to fact that the number of mask dependence increases for psychological reasons.

Today I will talk about the Japanese slang "sukebe".<br/><br/>"Sukebe" means that something or someone is lascivious, and it is usually used to men.<br/><br/>It is said that this slang comes from the word 「助兵衛」 (sukebe), which was used in the Edo period.<br/><br/>It was originally written as "好兵衛" (sukibe), and meant a person who had a strong interest in something.<br/><br/>(「好き」 (suki) means "to like", and 「兵衛」 is a suffix that personifies verbs and nouns.)<br/><br/>Since 「助兵衛」 (sukebe) was very popular name in that age, 「好兵衛」 (sukibe) changed to 「助兵衛」, then it came to mean only lascivious things.

Today I will talk about the Japanese idiom "itachi gokko".<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "itachi gokko" is "to pretend a weasel", and it means that two people repeat a same thing to each other, and it will not make any progress.<br/><br/>This idiom comes from a children's play that was popular in the late Edo period.<br/><br/>The play called "itachi gokko" is: two children pinch the back of the other's hand alternately, while saying "itachi gokko" (to pretend a weasel) and "nezumi gokko" (to pretend a mouse).<br/><br/>Since this play is just to do the same thing repeatedly, and has no end, it has come to express the above meaning.

Today I will talk about the Japanese words, "ganjitsu", "gantan" and "shogatsu", which are often misunderstood.<br/><br/>"元日 (ganjitsu)" means the first day of the new year, that is January 1st.<br/><br/>"元旦 (gantan)" could mean the first day of the new year, but it usually means "the morning of ganjitsu".<br/><br/>The kanji "旦" in "元旦" expresses that the sun (日) is coming out of the horizon (＿).<br/><br/>"正月 (shogatsu)" means the first month of the new year, that is January.<br/><br/>However, "正月" often means a period for new year's celebration -- it is "三が日 (san ga nichi)" (January 1-3), or "松の内 (matsu no uchi)" (January 1-7).

Today is the last day of "shogatsu san ga nichi".<br/>.<br/>"Shogatsu san ga nichi" (which you can call simply "san ga nichi") means the first three days of the new year -- January 1 - 3.<br/><br/>For almost all Japanese companies excluding service and tourism industry, san ga nichi is holiday.<br/><br/>During the san ga nichi, there are some things that you don't should not to do.<br/><br/>For example, they are cleaning, washing, and cooking.<br/><br/>It is said that doing the cleaning or the washing on the san ga nichi will turn fuku no kami (the God of good fortune) out of your house.<br/><br/>Also, it is said that cooking using fire on the san ga nichi will make the God of kitchen angry.<br/><br/>I think that these superstitions were made from the thought that people don't want to work on the first three days of the new year.

Today I spent slow-paced time with my family.<br/><br/>First I took a shower, had a breakfast, then played with my nephew and niece.<br/><br/>After that, I did my work of university until around evening, then my family went to a yakiniku shop (beef barbecue restaurant) to eat dinner with my brother's family.<br/><br/>I ate yakiniku after a long time, and it was delicious and satisfying. <br/><br/>Although it is almost night in Japan, I will go back to the area where I am working to avoid a major traffic jam.<br/><br/>I will be careful not to fall asleep and cause a traffic accident.

<div class="date" hidden>Jan 1, 2017 22:42</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A happy new year.<br/><br/>Today, January 1st, a leap second was inserted for the first time in one year and six months.<br/><br/>A leap second is a second that is added or deleted to eliminate the difference between the time system based on atomic clocks and the time system based on Earth's rotation.<br/><br/>In Japan, 8:59:60 am was inserted between 8:59:59 and 9:00:00.<br/><br/>The insertion of leap seconds was conducted 27 times so far.<br/><br/>I heard engineers would become very busy due to the insertion of the leap second, but I don't know how busy they are.<br/><br/>By the way, Google adjusted the time by delaying clock frequencies slightly, without inserting a leap second.
