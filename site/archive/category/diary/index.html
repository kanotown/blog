<strong><em>Shūbun no Hi</strong></em><br/><br/>Today, September 23rd, 2023, is <strong><em>Shūbun no HI</em></strong> (秋分の日 - "Autumnal Equinox Day") in Japan.<br/><br/>On This day, the length of day and night becomes almost equal, as on <strong><em>Shunbun no Hi</em></strong> (春分の日 - "Vernal Equinox Day"), around March 20th.<br/><br/><em>Shūbun no HI</em> is a national holiday to honor ancestors and remember the deceased.<br/><br/>Therefore, Japanese people often visit graves and clean Buddhist altars around that day.<br/><br/>Incidentally, in 2023, three national holidays, including <em>Shūbun no Hi</em>, fall on Saturdays, making it a year with fewer holidays than usual.

<strong><em>Sabusuku Binbō</strong></em><br/><br/>How much do you use subscription-based services?<br/><br/>I have numerous subscription agreements, mainly for music, video, manga, and cloud services. However, I have realized that many of them are unnecessary.<br/><br/>This phenomenon, where one continues to spend money on unnecessary subscription-based services, is sometimes referred to as <strong><em>sabusuku binbō</em></strong> (サブスク貧乏) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>sabusuku</em></strong> (サブスク) is short for "subscription," and <strong><em>binbō</em></strong> (貧乏) means "being poor," <em>sabusuku binbō</em> literally means "being poor due to subscriptions."<br/><br/>To avoid being <em>sabusuku binbō</em>, it is important to carefully consider whether or not the subscription-based service is truly necessary.

Released Original LINE Emoji<br/><br/>I occasionally draw four-panel comics based on the topics I posted on Lang-8<br/><br/>Since the number of illustrations of the character <strong><em>Chikuwa-kun</em></strong> (ちくわ君) in my comics increased, I created and released a LINE emoji package of him.<br/><br/>It was not easy for me to adjust to the size of the illustrations, and I had to redraw almost all of them, which took a lot of time.<br/><br/>Finally, I created emojis that I am personally satisfied with.<br/><br/>I wanted to release them for free if I could, but that was not possible due to LINE's terms and conditions.<br/><br/>If you are interested, please check out Chikuwa-kun's emojis at the following URL.<br/><br/><a href="https://store.line.me/emojishop/product/6508060222c545010728ce88/ja" target="_blank">https://store.line.me/emojishop/product/6508060222c545010728ce88/ja</a>

0-ji Machi<br/><br/>Yesterday, I did '0-ji machi' (0時待ち - literally "waiting for 0 o'clock") at a highway service area.<br/><br/>On Japanese highways, tolls are discounted by 30% all day on holidays and from midnight to 4 a.m. on weekdays.<br/><br/>This discount applies to the entire section you traveled, if you drive on the highway even for a short period during the designated hours.<br/><br/>Therefore, just before midnight, transportation trucks often stop one after another in front of toll gates, causing traffic jams.<br/><br/>This is known as '0-ji machi', which has become a problem, especially on Tokyo's highways.

<strong><em>My Boom</strong></em><br/><br/>Do you have something that is currently trending for you personally?<br/><br/>That kind of trend is called <strong><em>my boom</em></strong> (マイブーム) in Japanese.<br/><br/><em>My boom</em> is a Japanese-English expression combining "my" and "boom." While this expression is commonly used in Japan, native English speakers might not understand its meaning.<br/><br/>It can be translated into English as "my latest crazy" or "my current obsession," but these expressions may be a bit stronger compared to the nuance of the Japanese <em>my boom</em>.<br/><br/>Incidentally, my <em>my boom</em> is taking an open-air bath while gazing at the stars.<br/><br/>Last night was clear, and the lovely Delphinus constellation was distinctly visible.

<strong><em>Hikikomori</strong></em><br/><br/>People who withdraw into their homes or rooms and rarely go outside are called <strong><em>hikikomori</em></strong> (引きこもり) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The term <em>hikikomori</em> is derived from <strong><em>hiki</em></strong> (引き - meaning "withdrawal") and <strong><em>komori</em></strong> (こもり - meaning "seclusion").<br/><br/>Japan has a large number of <em>hikikomori</em>, and according to a 2023 survey by the Cabinet Office, it is estimated that about 1.46 million people aged 15-64 (approximately 2% of the population) are in a state of a long-term <em>hikikomori</em>.<br/><br/>I am often in a state of a short-term <em>hikikomori</em> on my days off.<br/><br/>Lately, even in a video game (The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom), I have been withdrawing into the underground and avoiding coming out. In a way, I am a <em>hikikomori</em> in a double sense.

<strong><em>Tamahyun</strong></em><br/><br/>When playing "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom," I frequently encounter a phenomenon called <strong><em>tamahyun</em></strong> (タマヒュン).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>tama</em></strong> (タマ) is a slang term for "balls/testicles," and <strong><em>hyun</em></strong> (ヒュン) is an onomatopoeic word representing that something shrinks, the literal meaning of <em>tamahyun</em> is "one's balls shrink."<br/><br/>Have you ever felt a sensation like your stomach shrinking when watching a video of someone working at great heights or falling from a high place in a game?<br/><br/>The sensation is known colloquially as <em>tamahyun</em>.<br/><br/>It is unclear whether the testicles actually shrink or not, but at least for men, we feel as if they are.

<strong><em>Ikitsuke</strong></em><br/><br/>I go to a nearby hot spring two to three times a week.<br/><br/>You can use the Japanese term, <strong><em>ikitsuke</em></strong> (行きつけ), to describe such a facility, shop, or restaurant, that you frequently visit.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>iki</em></strong> (行き) means "go," and <strong><em>tsuke</em></strong> (つけ) means "always," the literal meaning of <em>ikitsuke</em> is "always go."<br/><br/>This term is often used for restaurants or hair salons, and it is especially fitting for cases where you are familiar with the staff or owner.<br/><br/>For a hospital or dental clinic that you always visit (or the doctor there), you can use <strong><em>kakari</em></strong> (かかり - meaning "be treated") and say <strong><em>kakaritsuke</em></strong> (かかりつけ).

<strong><em>Atosaki Kangaezu</strong></em><br/><br/>Yesterday, while in a state described as <strong><em>atosaki kangaezu</em></strong> (後先考えず), I purchased an expensive game console.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>ato</em></strong> (後) means "after," <strong><em>saki</em></strong> (先) means "before/future," <strong><em>kangae/kangaeru</em></strong> (考え/考える) means "to consider," and <strong><em>zu</em></strong> (ず) is a negative suffix, <em>atosaki kangaezu</em> literally means "without considering before or after."<br/><br/>Acting without considering past experiences or future consequences could lead to failure and regret.<br/><br/>However, it is also not good to just keep thinking without taking any action.<br/><br/>I believe that balance is the key to everything.

A Trial Lesson<br/><br/>Yesterday, my university held an open campus, and I conducted a trial lesson as a teacher.<br/><br/>The content of the lesson was to give high school students hands-on experience in developing web applications.<br/><br/>However, it was difficult to provide each student with a computer for development.<br/><br/>After deep consideration, I decided to create an online source code editor and execution environment that can be used with smartphones and have students use them.<br/><br/>Although there were many concerns, such as the difficulty of writing codes on a smartphone and the load on the server, I could finish the trial lesson without any major trouble.<br/><br/>I thought it would be difficult to write source code on the narrow screen of a smartphone, but the high school students seemed to operate it very easily.

<div class="date">Jul 4, 2023 21:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The Japanese Youth Slang Term 'Mi': Part 2<br/><br/>Although <strong><em>mi</em></strong> (み) is a suffix used to turn adjectives into nouns, young Japanese people today apply it to various adjectives and even verbs.<br/><br/>The most famous example of using <em>mi</em> to nominalize a verb is <strong><em>wakarimi</em></strong> (わかりみ - "understanding"), which derives from the verb <strong><em>wakaru</em></strong> (わかる - "to understand").<br/><br/>The correct reason why young people began to attach <em>mi</em> to various words is not known, but it is thought to be for reasons such as "to soften the assertion by using euphemistic expressions" or "for the funny and cute sounds of the words."<br/><br/>Here, since using these nouns by themselves is incomplete as a sentence, they are often used with other verbs or adjectives, such as <strong><em>aru</em></strong> (ある - "to exist"), <strong><em>fukai</em></strong> (深い - "deep"), and <strong><em>kanjiru</em></strong> (感じる - "to feel").<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><strong><em>Wakarimi ga fukai</em></strong> (わかりみが深い - "I totally understand.") *very frequently used<br/><strong><em>Yabami wo kanjiru</em></strong> (やばみを感じる - "I feel dangerous.")

<strong><em>Yowari Me ni Tatari Me</strong></em><br/><br/>I had used my iPhone for two years without a case or film, and there was no scratch on it; however, several days ago, I dropped it on concrete, and now it has many scratches.<br/><br/>Even more unfortunately, today I dropped my MacBook Pro, which I bought a year ago for about $350,000, hard on the floor and it is now distorted.<br/><br/>I am very, very sad.<br/><br/>Such a situation can be described with the proverb, <strong><em>yowari me ni tatari me</em></strong> (弱り目に祟り目).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>yowari</em></strong> (弱り) means "weak/weakened," <strong><em>me</em></strong> (目) means "condition," <strong><em>tatari</em></strong> (祟り) means "curse," the literal meaning of this proverb is "weakened condition, and curse condition."<br/><br/>In other words, it represents a situation where further misfortune happens when one's mind or body is weak.

<strong><em>Chan Chara Okashī</strong></em><br/><br/>To describe something too ridiculous, you can use the slang term <strong><em>chan chara okashī</em></strong> (ちゃんちゃらおかしい).<br/><br/><strong><em>Okashī</em></strong> (おかしい) means "ridiculous" or "funny," and <strong><em>chan chara</em></strong> (ちゃんちゃら) emphasizes the following <em>okashī</em>.<br/><br/>The most accepted theory about the etymologies of <em>chan chara</em> is that it comes from <strong><em>chari</em></strong> (茶利), which means comical phrases and actions in kabuki or ningyo-joruri (traditional Japanese puppet theater).<br/><br/>However, please note that <em>chan chara okashī</em> does not describe something comical or funny but is used to scoff at something ridiculous.

<strong><em>Fūfu Genka wa Inu mo Kuwanu</strong></em><br/><br/>Marital quarrels are easily triggered by trivial matters and tend to be quickly resolved.<br/><br/>Therefore, you need not worry too seriously about other couples' quarrels. <br/><br/>To express such a situation, you can use the Japanese proverb, <strong><em>fūfu genka wa inu mo kuwanu</em></strong> (夫婦喧嘩は犬も食わぬ).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>fūfu</em></strong> (夫婦) means "married couple," <strong><em>kenka</em></strong> (喧嘩) means "quarrel," <strong><em>inu</em></strong> (犬) means "dog," <strong><em>kū/kuwa</em></strong> (食う/食わ) means "to eat," and <strong><em>nu</em></strong> (ぬ) is a negative suffix, the literal meaning of this proverb is "even dogs would not eat marital quarrels."<br/><br/>In other words, dogs eat most things, but even they are not interested in marital quarrels.<br/>

<strong><em>Tsumi-gē</strong></em><br/><br/>Recently, the number of <strong><em>tsumi-gē</em></strong> (積みゲー) in my room has been increasing.<br/><br/><em>Tsumi-gē</em> is a coined word that combines <strong><em>tsumi/tsumu</em></strong> (積み/積む - meaning "to be piled") and <strong><em>gē</em></strong> (ゲー - meaning "game"), referring to games that you have bought but not played and are piled up.<br/><br/>As you become an adult, you have more money but less time and energy to play games, so the <em>tsumi-gē</em> phenomenon is more likely to occur.<br/><br/>Incidentally, books that you have bought but not read are called <strong><em>tsun-doku</em></strong> (積ん読).<br/><br/>Here, <strong><em>doku</em></strong> (読) means "reading," and <em>tsun-doku</em> is a wordplay that implies the phrase <strong><em>tsunde oku/tsundoku</em></strong> (積んでおく/積んどく - meaning "I pile up something").

<strong><em>Gaden Insui</strong></em><br/><br/>The action of trying to make things happen to one's own advantage is called <strong><em>gaden insui</em></strong> (我田引水) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>ga</em></strong> (我) means "my," <strong><em>den</em></strong> (田) means "field," <strong><em>in</em></strong> (引) means <br/>"to draw," and <strong><em>sui</em></strong> (水) means "water," the literal meaning of this four-character idiom is "to draw water to my own field."<br/><br/>Imagine the selfish act of drawing water only to your own field while ignoring other people's fields. That is <em>gaden insui</em>.<br/><br/>Such a selfishness act can also be described as <strong><em>temae gatte</em></strong> (手前勝手) or <strong><em>jibun katte</em></strong> (自分勝手).

<strong><em>Suzume Hyaku Made Odori Wasurezu</strong></em><br/><br/>It is difficult to break bad habits acquired in childhood, even as one grows older.<br/><br/>The proverb, <strong><em>suzume hyaku made odori wasurezu</em></strong> (雀百まで踊り忘れず), can describe such a situation.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>suzume</em></strong> (雀) means "sparrow," <strong><em>hyaku</em></strong> (百) means "hundred," <strong><em>made</em></strong> (まで) means "until," <strong><em>odori</em></strong> (踊り) means "dance," <strong><em>wasure/wasureru</em></strong> (忘れ/忘れる) means "to forget," and <strong><em>zu</em></strong> (ず) is a negative suffix, the literal meaning of this proverb is "sparrows never forget to dance until they are a hundred years old."<br/><br/>When sparrows move on the ground, they jump in small steps as if dancing.<br/><br/>From the fact that the sparrows' dance-like gait does not change throughout their lifetime, this proverb was born, comparing "dance-like gait" to "bad habit."

Moving to HiNative<br/><br/>For more than six years, Lang-8 has stopped accepting registrations from new users.<br/><br/>Around the same time, a similar service called HiNative was launched, and people were directed there, but I stayed here because HiNative didn't have long text posting and correction functions like on Lang-8.<br/><br/>However, a few days ago, my friend who read my entries told me it was no longer readable.<br/><br/>Lang-8 used to allow everyone to view entries by setting their publication range, but it seems that the setting no longer works.<br/><br/>Registrations from new users and updates have stopped, and the number of active users is decreasing; it seems to be getting worse and worse.<br/><br/>On the other hand, HiNative came to have long text posting and correction functions, although it seemed to require some charge.<br/><br/>I am now considering moving to HiNative and posting entries there.<br/><br/>The following is my HiNative profile page.<br/><br/><a href="https://ja.hinative.com/profiles/20278" target="_blank">https://ja.hinative.com/profiles/20278</a>

<strong><em>Ichibō Senri</strong></em><br/><br/>Today I went to an onsen and took an open-air bath offering a view of the Pacific Ocean that fills your field of vision.<br/><br/>This scenic view can be described as <strong><em>ichibō senri</em></strong> (一望千里).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>ichi</em></strong> (一) means "one" and <strong><em>bō</em></strong> (望) means "to look into the distance," <strong><em>ichibō</em></strong> (一望) means "to look out over a wide landscape with a single view."<br/><br/>In addition, <strong><em>sen</em></strong> (千) means "thousand," and <strong><em>ri</em></strong> (里) is the old Japanese unit of distance, which is about 4 km.<br/><br/>The literal meaning of <strong><em>senri</em></strong> (千里) is "four thousand kilometers," but it can also be used as a metaphor for a very long distance.<br/><br/>That is to say, <em>ichibō senri</em> means a good view of the landscape where you can see very wide and far distances with a single view.<br/><br/>It was night, but the sea breeze was pleasant, and the full moon was so beautiful that I felt happy!

It's been a very long time since my last post.<br/><br/>Today is my new <strong><em>kadode</em></strong> (門出).<br/><br/><strong><em>Kado</em></strong> (門) means "gate" and 'de'(出) means "to leave." Since <em>kadode</em> symbolizes leaving the gate of one's own house, it means a "day of departure" or "beginning of a new life."<br/><br/><em>Kadode</em> is often used for graduation, employment, or marriage, and is frequently referred to as <strong><em>atarashii kadode</em></strong> (新しい門出) or <strong><em>aratana kadode</em></strong> (新たな門出) with the adjective <strong><em>atarashii/aratana</em></strong> (新たな - meaning "new").<br/><br/>Starting this April, I am changing jobs and beginning work as an associate professor at a new university.<br/><br/>I am very excited to finally have my own research lab, which has been a long-held dream of mine.<br/><br/>I will also resume my English studies from now on.

<strong><em>Torikoshi Kurō</strong></em><br/><br/>I got the second vaccine of COVID-19 today.<br/><br/>It is said that there are strong vaccine adverse reactions, so I am very worried about that.<br/><br/>However, there may not be any adverse reactions.<br/><br/>As in this situation, concerning unnecessarily about something that no one knows what will happen is called <strong><em>torikoshi kurō</em></strong> (取り越し苦労) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>torikoshi</em></strong> (取り越し) means "bringing forward something" and <strong><em>kuro</em></strong> (苦労) means "trouble," <em>torikoshi kurō</em> literally means "bringing forward trouble."<br/><br/>This phrase can be translated into English as "worrying about nothing."

<div class="date">Sep 13, 2021 16:40</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Ishi ni Futon wa Kiserarezu</strong></em><br/><br/>There is the Japanese proverb, <strong><em>ishi ni futon wa kiserarezu</em></strong> (石に布団は着せられず).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>ishi</em></strong> (石) means "stone," <strong><em>futon</em></strong> (布団) means "comforter," and <strong><em>kakerarezu</em></strong> (かけられず) means "can't put on," the literal meaning of <em>ishi ni futon wa kiserarezu</em> means "you can't put a comforter on a stone."<br/><br/>Here, "stone" specifically means "gravestone."<br/><br/>There is no point in putting a comforter on parents' gravestones.<br/><br/>This proverb says that you should always be filial to your parents.

Poster Presentation using Virbela<br/><br/>Today, we held a poster presentation for about 100 students at our university using Virbela, a service that enables communication in VR (Virtual Reality) space.<br/> <br/>The preparation and management were very tough for me, and some minor problems occurred, but we managed to finish this event successfully.<br/><br/>I believe that compared to cases using Zoom, the communication and discussion among students became more active.<br/><br/>In the future, it is expected that the demand for similar services will increase and continue to increase and the market will develop.<br/><br/>We must continue to study every day to keep up with this rapidly changing world.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Bon Misu</strong></em><br/><br/>I made a <strong><em>bon misu</em></strong> (凡ミス) of deleting my post today.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>bon</em></strong> (凡) means "ordinary" or "common," and <strong><em>misu</em></strong> (ミス) comes from the English term "mistake," the literal meaning of <em>bon misu</em> is "common mistake."<br/><br/>However, the actual meanin of <em>bon misu</em> is closer to "careless mistake" than to "common mistake."<br/><br/>"Careless mistake" can be translated into Japanese as <strong><em>kearesu misu</em></strong> (ケアレスミス) or <strong><em>ukkari misu</em></strong> (うっかりミス) instead of <em>bon misu</em>.<br/><br/>In my opinion, <em>bon misu</em> has the most stupid nuance among the above translations.

Catalog Gift<br/><br/>Today, I received a "catalog gift" as a commemorative gift from a student who graduated from university.<br/><br/>I am very pleased about it.<br/><br/>A catalog gift is a kind of gift in which the receiver can choose his/her favorite items from a catalog listing various products.<br/><br/>That is to say, I have a catalog now.<br/><br/>When I choose one of them then post an application card, the gift will be delivered to me.<br/><br/>In Japan, there have been many troubles related to gift-giving since long ago.<br/><br/>To solve such troubles, catalog gifts have been commonly used since the 1980s.

Limited Graduation Ceremony<br/><br/>Today, my university held a graduation ceremony at Nippon Budokan with restricted admission.<br/><br/>No graduates' families were allowed to attend, and only graduates and faculty members were able to attend.<br/><br/>Participation is not mandatory, and some graduates and faculty members were absent.<br/><br/>Although it was a limited graduation ceremony, I felt that it was a big change compared to the graduation ceremony last year that was canceled due to COVID-19.<br/><br/>Of course, attendees were required to go home promptly after the graduation ceremony.<br/><br/>I hope that we will be able to hold a thank-you party or a graduation party next year.

<strong><em>Takara no Mochigusare</strong></em><br/><br/>I splashed out and bought a new car about a year ago.<br/><br/>However, COVID-19 has become pandemic since immediately after that, so I could rarely use the car.<br/><br/>I think that I have used my new car only about 10 times in the past year.<br/><br/>Such a situation can be described as <strong><em>takara no motigusare</em></strong> (宝の持ち腐れ).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>takar</em></strong> (宝) means "treasure," <strong><em>mochi</em></strong> (持ち) means "have," and <strong><em>gusare/kusare</em></strong> (腐れ) means "rot," so <em>takara no motigusare</em> means "The treasure you have is rotting."<br/><br/>It implies that if one does not use something useful or talented that the one has, it will be a waste.

First International Conference in a While<br/><br/>Today, I participated in an international conference and made a presentation in English for the first time in about two years.<br/><br/>It was an online conference using Zoom, but I was very nervous.<br/><br/>In particular, the problem was the question and answer session after my presentation.<br/><br/>I was not confident that I could answer English questions immediately and well.<br/><br/>Since the first question was simple, I managed to answer it.<br/><br/>However, I could not understand the intent of the second question.<br/><br/>Eventually, I had no idea what to say, and barely said "umm, it's a difficult question for me...," then the questioner said something like "okay" and the session was over.<br/><br/>I must study harder.

International Women's Day<br/><br/>Today, March 8 is International Women's Day.<br/><br/>The United Nations has designated March 8 as International Women's Day since 1987, and various events have been held in the world.<br/><br/>However, I heard the news that a Swedish ambassador to Japan said that he does not like this day.<br/><br/>According to the news, he said "It is strange to celebrate only this day as Women's Day," "Why can we celebrate even though we are in an unequal state," and "Every day should be a day of gender equality."<br/><br/>Indeed, I think that that is right.<br/><br/>On this day, it is perhaps better to think and discuss gender equality than to celebrate.

<strong><em>Kagishippo</strong></em><br/><br/>There are many stray cats living around my apartment.<br/><br/>Around noon today, a stray cat that crossed in front of me had <strong><em>kagisippo</em></strong> (かぎしっぽ).<br/><br/><strong><em>Kagi</em></strong> (かぎ) means "key," <strong><em>shippo</em></strong> (しっぽ) means "tail," and <strong><em>kagishippo</em></strong> (かぎしっぽ) is a term for representing a tail of a cat bent like a key.<br/><br/>A cat's tail is commonly composed of 18 to 20 coccygeal vertebrae, and it becomes <em>kagishippo</em> when a part of the coccygeal vertebrae deforms or fuses.<br/><br/>Cats with <em>kagishippo</em> have been believed to protect property in Japan and China, and they have been cherished as auspicious cats.<br/><br/>Also in European countries, it seems that such cats are treated as auspicious cats.

<strong><em>Daitai</strong></em><br/><br/>Yesterday, I was working all day and could not write a post on Lang-8.<br/><br/>My daily English learning goal on Lang-8 is to write more than 100 words.<br/><br/>In my work yesterday, I wrote over 1000 English words, so I would like to regard this task as <strong><em>daitai</em></strong> (代替) of yesterday's learning goal.<br/><br/>Since the kanji 替 is often used in the readings of <strong><em>kae</em></strong> (かえ) or <strong><em>gae</em></strong> (がえ), I feel that many Japanese people mistakenly read 代替 as <em>daigae</em>.<br/><br/>To tell you the truth, the reading <em>daigae</em> is listed in Japanese dictionaries as a special reading, but it is not a normative one.

<strong><em>Iki wo Nomu Utsukushisa</strong></em><br/><br/>Lately, I work while seeing natural landscape videos on a display installed at the back of my desk.<br/><br/>I played a Russian landscape video today.<br/><br/>The beautiful scene was played continuously, but the scenery of jewel-like ice (probably Lake Bikal) was breathtaking.<br/><br/>In the last Japanese sentence, I added <strong><em>iki wo nomu</em></strong> (息を呑む) before <strong><em>utukushisa</em></strong> (美しさ), meaning "beauty."<br/><br/><strong><em>Iki</em></strong> (息) means "breath" and <strong><em>nomu</em></strong> (呑む) means "to drink/swallow."<br/><br/>That is to say, <em>iki wo nomu</em> implies that you are so surprised that you hold your breath for a moment, and it can emphasize adjectives.<br/><br/>Today's work did not go well very much because I was fascinated by the video.

The Emperor's Birthday (2019-)<br/><br/>Today, February 23 is a Japanese national holiday called "the Emperor's Birthday."<br/><br/>The purpose of this holiday is literally to celebrate the emperor's birthday.<br/><br/>This entry implies that the current Japanese emperor Tokuhito who has reigned since May 1, 2019, born on February 23.<br/><br/>Until April 30, 2019, The Emperor's Birthday was December 23, which is the birthday of the former emperor Akihito.<br/><br/>(I wrote a post introducing the Emperor's Birthday also on December 23, 2015.)<br/><br/>On this day, various events are usually held in the emperor's court; however, last year and this year, these events were canceled in light of the current situation where COVID-19 is spreading.

Deer in Nara<br/><br/>Today I came to Nara to participate in an academic conference.<br/><br/>The conference venue was near Nara Park, which is famous for deer, so I saw a lot of deer on the way to the venue.<br/><br/>According to a survey, the number of deer living in Nara Park is about 1400.<br/><br/>Indeed, I felt that there were deer everywhere in the park.<br/><br/>Furthermore, since there were a lot of deer droppings, it was not easy to avoid them.<br/><br/>Incidentally, when I got on a bus to go to a hotel I reserved, the bus was crowded, and a child kicked my pants.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, his shoes were very dirty -- probably he stepped on a lot of deer droppings.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Gyū-tan</strong></em><br/><br/>Today I went to a barbecue restaurant and ate many grilled meat with my best friend.<br/><br/>The food what we first ate was <strong><em>gyū-tan</em></strong> (牛タン - "ox tongue").<br/><br/>I think that most Japanese people will first eat ox tongues when they go to a Japanese barbecue restaurant.<br/><br/>Since ox tongues have less fat and are not strongly seasoned, you can enjoy the taste the most when you eat it first.<br/><br/>In addition, it is often seasoned with only salt, so ox tongues do not contaminate a grill or iron plate; this is the other reason that people eat ox tongues first.

<strong><em>Shufu and Shufu</strong></em><br/><br/>A married woman who manages her family's home and caring for her children is called <strong><em>shufu</em></strong> (主婦 - "housewife") in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>shu</em></strong> (主) means "principal" and <strong><em>fu</em></strong> (婦) means "lady," the literal meaning of <strong><em>shufu</em></strong> (主婦) is "principal lady."<br/><br/>On the other hand, these days men who manage his family's home are increasing, so another term <strong><em>shufu</em></strong> (主夫 - "househusband") has come to be used.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>fu</em></strong> (夫) means "husband," the literal meaning of <strong><em>shufu</em></strong> (主夫) is "principal husband."<br/><br/>Note that both 主婦 and 主夫 have the same pronunciation.

<strong><em>Tehepero</strong></em><br/><br/>Have you ever tried to hide your embarrassment when you made a mistake?<br/><br/>In such a case, you might be able to use the slang term <strong><em>tehepero</em></strong> (てへぺろ).<br/><br/>It is said that this term was made by a Japanese voice actor, Yōko Hikasa, and now it is widely used mainly among young people.<br/><br/><strong><em>Tehe</em></strong> (てへ) represents bashfulness while laughing, and <strong><em>pero</em></strong> (ぺろ) represents an action of sticking out one's tongue.<br/><br/>That is to say, <em>tehepero</em> means to stick out your tongue while laughing and getting shy, and this adorable behavior has a purpose for hiding your mistake and being forgiven.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Omegane ni Kanau</strong></em><br/><br/>Several days ago, I introduced Japanese terms, <strong><em>megane</em></strong> (眼鏡 - "glasses"), <strong><em>mushimegane</em></strong> (虫眼鏡 - "magnifying glass"), and <strong><em>iromegane</em></strong> (色眼鏡 - "colored glasses").<br/><br/>There is a famous idiom that uses <em>megane</em> -- it is <strong><em>omegane ni kanau</em></strong> (御眼鏡に適う).<br/><br/><strong><em>O</em></strong> (御) is a polite prefix, <strong><em>megane</em></strong> (眼鏡) means "glasses," and <strong><em>kanau</em></strong> (適う) means "to suit," so the literal meaning of <em>omegane ni kanau</em> is "to suit one's glasses."<br/><br/>Here, glasses imply that someone's ability to assess things.<br/><br/>In other words, <em>omegane ni kanau</em> means to gain favor with someone.

Family Trip 2019<br/><br/>We are now in <strong><em>Enakyō</em></strong> (恵那峡 - "Ena Gorge") on a family trip.<br/><br/>First, we went to an amusement park named Enakyō Wonderland, then rode some attractions, had a barbecue and observed sheep shearing.<br/><br/>In addition, we enjoyed exploring the wonderful natural environment -- there was a beautiful river surrounded by mountains.<br/><br/>After that, we went to a hotel, went in a hot spring, had dinner, and played table tennis.<br/><br/>Playing table tennis while wearing yukata (Japanese summer kimono) at a hot spring inn is very common in Japan.<br/><br/>We will enjoy the nature of Enakyō further by riding a cruiser.

<strong><em>Suima ni Osowareru</strong></em><br/><br/>I am very sleepy now.<br/><br/>When you become very drowsy or sleepy, it can be described as <strong><em>suima ni osowareru</em></strong> (睡魔に襲われる) in Japanese.<br/><br/><strong><em>Sui</em></strong> (睡) means "sleep," <strong><em>ma</em></strong> (魔) means "devil," <strong><em>osou</em></strong> (襲う) means "to attak," and <strong><em>wareru</em></strong> (われる) is a passive expression, so the literal meaning of this phrase is "to be attacked by a devil of sleep."<br/><br/>As you can guess, this phrase compares strong sleepiness that is hard to resist to a devil of sleep.

The Toilet was Clogged<br/><br/>I have visited Washington D.C. to attend an academic conference.<br/><br/>And I have stayed at a hotel near the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, but I had big trouble this morning.<br/><br/>The toilet in my room was clogged.<br/><br/>I might have used too much toilet paper.<br/><br/>As a last resort, I called the front desk and said "Excuse me. The toilet in my room is blocked. Can someone come and fix it?"<br/><br/>The front desk clerk said "Okay," but no one came to my room for a while, so I left five dollars as a chip and headed to the conference venue.<br/><br/>I would like to be more careful in the future.

<strong><em>Mune ga Ippai ni Naru</strong></em><br/><br/>Yesterday, a farewell party for teachers who would retire or change their jobs at my university was held.<br/><br/>Since I was also one of the teachers who leave the university, my boss paid me a heartfelt compliment, then I was filled with joy.<br/><br/>When you are filled with emotions such as joy or grief, you can describe it as <strong><em>mune ga ippai ni naru</em></strong> (胸がいっぱいになる).<br/><br/><strong><em>Mune</em></strong> (胸) means "heart," <strong><em>ippai</em></strong> (いっぱい) means "full" or "many," and <strong><em>naru</em></strong> (なる) means "to be," so the literal meaning of this phrase is "one's heart is filled."<br/><br/>[Example] Kanasimi de mune ga ippai ni natta (悲しみで胸がいっぱいになった - "I overflowed with grief").

Japanese Airline<br/><br/>I have been to overseas three times by airplane so far.<br/><br/>All airlines that I used were very cheap (low-cost carrier, LCC), but in this business trip, I boarded an airplane operated by the Japanese airline, ANA (All Nippon Airways).<br/><br/>In addition to the expensive fee, it was not wide because it was an economy class, but the service was polite, and the flight was very comfortable.<br/><br/>Incidentally, when boarding an airplane using public research fundings, basically we have to choose an economy class.<br/><br/>Someday, I would like to use a business class or a first class (or a premium economy class).

<strong><em>Suri</strong></em><br/><br/>Today is the last day of my stay in Italy, and I will visit Venice.<br/><br/>In sightseeing areas where there are many people such as Venice, you have to be careful about <strong><em>suri</em></strong> (スリ).<br/><br/><em>Suri</em> means an act of stealing money or goods from someone's bag or pocket without being seen, or a person who does that.<br/><br/>There are several theories about its etymology, but one theory explains that it comes from the fact that <strong><em>karada wo kosuri tsukeru</em></strong> (体を擦り付ける - literally means "to rub one's body (against other's body)" while stealing.<br/><br/>Incidentally, according to the Internet, suris (pickpockets) in Venice pretend to tourists, so you need to pay close attention.

<strong><em>Nigashita Sakana wa Ookii</strong></em><br/><br/>Today, I knew that I missed a very big chance.<br/><br/>However, something that you were about to get but missed may looks greater than it is.<br/><br/>There is a proverb to express the fact; it is <strong><em>nigashita sakana wa ookii</em></strong> (逃がした魚は大きい).<br/><br/><strong><em>Nigashita</em></strong> (逃がした) means "missed," <strong><em>sakana</em></strong> (魚) means "fish," and <strong><em>ookii</em></strong> (大きい) means "big," so the literal meaning of this proverb is "the missed fish was big."<br/><br/>Anyway, in order not to regret, I will try to seize a chance as soon as it comes in front of me.

iPhone Xs<br/><br/>About three months ago, I bought a smartphone equipped with a physical keyboard, BlackBerry Key2.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, various problems occurred while using the smartphone; some applications often crashed, terrible noises occurred during a call, and the sound sometimes stopped ringing.<br/><br/>Therefore, I decided to buy iPhone Xs this Monday.<br/><br/>(The big price of 150,000 yen put a big dent in my wallet.)<br/><br/>It has only been a few days since purchasing, but I have been able to use it comfortably without any problems so far.<br/><br/>The only regret I have is that the usability of the BlackBerry Key2's keyboard was really comfortable.

Mountain Climbing Alone<br/><br/>Today I woke up early and tried to climb Mountain Hinode alone.<br/><br/>Since it takes about only three hours to climb up and down the mountain, it might be closer to hiking than climbing.<br/><br/>However, it was really tough for me to reach the top of the mountain, because these days I have not taken exercise.<br/><br/>When I reached the mountain's peak, I felt awful, so I needed to rest on a bench for about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>After recovering from the bad feeling, I realized that there were beautiful mountains with a nice view.<br/><br/>This is the best part of climbing.

A Family Trip during Bon Day 2<br/><br/>On the second day of the Nagano trip, we first went to the Chihiro Art Museum Azumino.<br/><br/>Chihiro IWASAKI is a famous artist painter and picture book writer in Japan, and she has affected a lot of Japanese people including my family.<br/><br/>In this art museum, in addition to her works, there were many picture books by various artists around the world.<br/><br/>After visiting there, we went to an innkeeping town called Naraijuku, which is located at an altitude of about 900 meters.<br/><br/>Since traditional Japanese houses and streets were kept, it was beautiful.

A Family Trip during Bon Day 1<br/><br/>I went to Azumino city, Nagano, with my family and relatives during the last two days of Bon holidays (that is, from August 14th to 15th).<br/><br/>First, we visited Daiō Wasabi Farm (大王わさび農場 - literally "King wasabi farm"), then saw the wasabi farm and ate dishes that use wasabi.<br/><br/>Transparent water on the farm was very beautiful, and the wasabi dishes were delicious.<br/><br/>After that, we checked in at a hotel, got into a hot spring, and went to a fireworks display.<br/><br/>We really enjoyed a grand display of 12,000 fireworks in the night sky.

Traffic Jams at Midnight<br/><br/>Today is the Japanese national holiday called <strong><em>Yama no Hi</em></strong> (山の日 - literally "Mountain Day").<br/><br/>In most Japanese companies, the long summer holidays called <strong><em>obon yasumi</em></strong> (お盆休み - literally "Bon Holidays") began today.<br/><br/>I also returned my parents' home in Aichi from Tokyo.<br/><br/>In order to avoid traffic jams accompanying the holidays, I departed by car around 1:30 am, but I underestimated this holiday.<br/><br/>Despite midnight, I got traffic jams on the expressway.<br/><br/>I tried to take rest on a rest area, but there was no space to stop.<br/><br/> Surprisingly, the length of the traffic jams grew to around 30 kilometers at aroud noon.

Thirty-Six Books<br/><br/>I have been trouble deciding on a topic for posts on Lang-8 lately.<br/><br/>Therefore, I looked for books concerning words or culture on the Kindle store, in order to use them as a reference for a topic.<br/><br/>Then, I noticed that a special sale was being held -- many books were sold for 99 yen (about 89 cents).<br/><br/>Impulsively, I clicked "Buy now with 1-Click" button many times, and finally, I bought 36 books.<br/><br/>I bought various kinds of books -- books of kanji, books of English grammar, books of history, books of religion, books of trivia, etc.<br/><br/>I will write entries using these books starting tomorrow.

Since the deadline for a manuscript of an academic conference was 9 o'clock this morning, I worked through the night.<br/>(Unfortunately, I couldn't make the deadline, and missed an opportunity to visit Italy.)<br/><br/>Doing work desperately like this is often expressed as "shimekiri ni owareru" (締め切りに追われる) in Japanese.<br/><br/><strong><em>Shimekiri</em></strong> (締め切り) means <em>deadline</em> and <strong><em>owareru</em></strong> (追われる) means <em>being chased,</em> so the literal meaning of this phrase is "being chased by a deadline."<br/><br/>As you can guess, we use the verb <strong><em>owareru</em></strong> (追われる - being chased) to imply that the deadline is approaching.<br/><br/>This phrase can be translated into English as "being under a deadline" or "facing the pressure of a deadline."

Today I would like to write my post under the theme of 'me and the foreign language.'<br/><br/>The reason that I study English is closely related to my purpose in life. <br/><br/>I am currently researching diagnostic and measurement technology at my university, and I would like to become a researcher who is active on the front lines of that field.<br/><br/>Toward this goal, two abilities are essential: one is the ability to read scientific papers written in English, and the other is the ability to disseminate study results to the world in English.<br/><br/>Because of this, I learn and write English on Lang-8 every day.<br/><br/>However, these days I have not practiced listening and speaking; undoubtedly, I need more practices towards an international conference that is held after a few months.

Sea of Blood<br/><br/>Around 4:30 am today, I woke up because of feeling uncomfortable.<br/><br/>I was sleeping on my face down, and I felt that something dropped from my nose.<br/><br/>I thought "Ah, my nose is running," but when I saw my bedding, I found that there is a sea of blood.<br/><br/>A lot of blood flowed from my nose.<br/><br/>While becoming so depressed, I wiped off the blood on my bedding by using a wet towel repeatedly.<br/><br/>After I dried my bedding, I fell asleep again with a feeling of weariness.<br/><br/>The cause might be that I ate dinner at 11:00 pm yesterday -- eating food late at night increases your blood pressure.

The maximum temperature in Tokyo yesterday was about 14 degrees Celsius.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the maximum temperature today is also about 14 degrees Celsius.<br/><br/>It is cold for May.<br/><br/>According to the records about temperature, it is the first time in recent 25 years that the maximum temperature in Tokyo in May was less than 15 degrees Celsius for the second successive day.<br/><br/>In spite of that, according to the weather forecast, the maximum temperature in the next week will be 30 degrees Celsius.<br/><br/>The number is double.<br/><br/>When there is such a severe change in temperature, you could upset your health.<br/><br/>Since I have a significant event next week, I have to be careful.

I have written and posted short English texts on a language exchange social networking website called Lang-8 every day for about 1220 days. However, today I cannot connect to the web page. I am not entirely comfortable with such the interruption though I have tried to continue the challenge. Therefore, today I would like to write and post English texts on this blog page. Perhaps native English speakers would not correct these texts, but I have almost no other choice. If Lang-8 doesn't recover or its unstable state continues, I will post English texts/essays on this page in the future.<br/><br/><a href="https://blog.kano.ac/" target="_blank">https://blog.kano.ac/</a>

I<em>ve been staying at my parents</em> house in Aichi prefecture since last Friday.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have to go back to Tokyo by tonight because I have work tomorrow.<br/><br/>Originally, I planned to drive to Tokyo yesterday in order to have leeway, but I watched the news about "U-turn rush" and stopped departing.<br/><br/>"U-turn rush" means a crowded situation that occurs when people who have come to their parents' home go back (u-turn) to Tokyo for work.<br/><br/>The highway that I planned to use seemed to have a 31 kilometers long traffic jam.<br/><br/>Since many Japanese do their work from today, not only roads but also trains were very crowded yesterday.<br/><br/>Today I will drive on unoccupied highways in comfort.

<div class="date">Dec 23, 2017 12:22</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
During this time of year, a lot of 忘年会 (bounenkai) are held in Japan.<br/><br/>A bounenkai is a drinking party that is held at the end of the year, in order to forget the past year.<br/><br/>There is no religious meaning or particular style.<br/><br/>The 忘 (bou) means "to forget," the 年 (nen) means "year," and the 会 (kai) means "party," so 忘年会 (bounenkai) literally means "forget the part year party."<br/><br/>I think that End of the Year Party is very similar to bounenkai.<br/><br/>Incidentally, today I will participate in a bounenkai - this is the third time this week.

Yesterday I became sick.<br/><br/>Since I had a sore throat and a headache, I thought that I caught a cold.<br/><br/>Therefore, I went home early, ate dinner, and went to bed.<br/><br/>However, I woke up in the middle of the night due to a severe headache and a feeling of nausea, then I vomited all food I ate for dinner.<br/><br/>It was very painful because I woke up repeatedly with the headache and the nausea.<br/><br/>After I slept for about 18 hours, these symptoms were finally lessened somewhat.<br/><br/>However, my condition is still bad -- in such a day, I will post a simple diary like this.

Since the number of my entries, 1000, is a round figure, I rewrote my self-introduction a bit as follows. Note that there are many overlapping parts.<br/><br/>------------------------------------<br/><br/>Hi, I'm a teacher at a university in Tokyo, Japan. I'm engaged in some studies related to non-destructive inspection/diagnosis in X-ray CT imaging. On this Lang-8, I've written about a Japanese idiom, Japanese culture or a trivial matter every day. I hope these posts will be useful for foreigners who learn Japanese.<br/><br/>Please feel free to send a friend request. :)<br/><br/>[ Hobby ]<br/>My hobbies are watching American dramas, solving math and programming problems and riding my road bike. I think that I've watched a lot of American dramas, for example, Friends, Dr. House, Numbers, Ugly Betty, Breaking Bad, Person of Interest, Suits, Lie to Me, FLASH, The Big Bang Theory, The Mentalist, Modern Family, and so on (sometimes UK dramas like SHERLOCK are included). If there is a drama that you can recommend, I want you to tell me.<br/><br/>[ Dream ]<br/>My dream is to study in a university in the US and to become a professor of a university.<br/>

Today the number of my posts on Lang-8 finally reached 1000.<br/><br/>Since I tend to slack off or goof off my work, it was really hard for me to continue writing articles every day.<br/><br/>Also, today I was received a letter of appointment -- it means that I officially promoted to assistant professor on September 1, 2017.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the day, September 1, 2017 was my 30th birthday.<br/><br/>Furthermore, on that day, the domain of my personal homepage expired.<br/><br/>The day was an unusual day when various events overlapped. <br/><br/>Next, I will do my best to post 2000 entries and become an associate professor.

Yesterday, I wrote about a bug that you can't see posts on Lang-8.<br/><br/>After that, I received some comments and messages about the solution to the bug.<br/><br/>According to the messages, when you post your entry, if you set the access settings to "Share with all Lang-8 users" or "Share with My Friends only" (not "Public"), such a problem will be eliminated.<br/>(The bug would also be solved if you set it to "Privat - Just Me," but there is almost no meaning to post on Lang-8 in the setting.)<br/><br/>I really appreciate the information.<br/><br/>I'd like to share it on this post as well.<br/><br/>However, since it does not a fundamental solution, I hope that this site will be modified in the near future.

Recently I can't see my posts on Lang-8.<br/><br/>I tried to see them with various web browsers, such as Chrome, FireFox, Safari, and EDGE,  and re-login several times, but the results were the same.<br/><br/>I have no idea about the cause, but other Lang-8 users seem to be unable to see my posts as well.<br/><br/>Only when I used a smartphone, I could browse them.<br/><br/>I'm very sad.<br/><br/>This post is containing a test.<br/><br/>I think that if I write sentences without my native language (Japanese), such a sad bug may be removed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have a feeling that it won't work.<br/><br/>If you have any solution, please let me know it.

Today I will return to Tokyo.<br/><br/>I decided to visit some sightseeing spots in Kumamoto city before getting on an airplane.<br/><br/>First, I went to Kumamoto Castle.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, many areas in Kumamoto Castle were restricted because of the impact of the great earthquake occurred last year.<br/><br/>When I watched some collapsed or crumbling buildings, I felt sad.<br/><br/>For lunch, I ate delicious horse meat steak and marbling horse meat sashimi.<br/><br/>After that, I went to Suizen-ji Jōju-en.<br/><br/>There were a lot of green, a beautiful pond, and beautiful scenery.<br/><br/>Now I am relaxing in a lounge in an airport while drinking alcohol.

Today I presented my study in an academic conference for the first time in six months.<br/><br/>The material for presentation was completed about one hour before my presentation.<br/><br/>Since I couldn't finish it until just before my session, I have never could practice my presentation.<br/><br/>I was very nervous, but I could speak better than I thought, it doesn't terrible too much.<br/><br/>However, in the question and answer session, I became a little panicked, said some weird things.<br/><br/>I was very embarrassed and felt miserable.<br/><br/>I'd like to devote myself further to studying so that I can answer more smartly.

Today I got lost in Kumamoto University.<br/><br/>I'm often confused about the direction I'm heading when I go to a new land.<br/><br/>In the university, I watched a map made of paper, thought like "okay, I understand the route," and started walking.<br/><br/>However, the destination was in the completely opposite direction.<br/><br/>Recently I may depend on Google Map too much.<br/><br/>There are many places where Google Map doesn't work, such as premises of universities or underground, I think that I have to do practice to be able read paper maps.<br/><br/>Anyway, I will be careful not to get lost in my life.

Today, I came to Kumamoto city, Kumamoto Prefecture, in order to participate in an academic conference that will be held tomorrow.<br/><br/>The distance from Tokyo to Kumamoto is around 1000 km, but I arrived within two hours by using an airplane.<br/><br/>Then, when I was about to ride a bus to Kumamoto city, I accidentally encountered my mentor -- he came from Nagano Prefecture for the same reason as me.<br/><br/>We talked a lot in the bus and ate dinner.<br/><br/>I was very lucky.<br/><br/>However, when I was doing my work at my hotel after dinner, I found a huge cockroach crawling around my feet.<br/><br/>Since I rarely see cockroaches, it was so terrifying.<br/><br/>I told it to a hotel worker, then my room was changed.

Day before yesterday, I stayed at a resort hotel called "Hotel Urashima" (ホテル浦島).<br/><br/>The name of this hotel comes from the famous Japanese fairy tale, "Urashima Tarō."<br/><br/>The outline of "Urashima Tarō" is something like the following.<br/><br/>A fisherman called Urashima Tarō, found a turtle that is being tormented by children, and rescued it.<br/><br/>In order to express gratitude, the turtle put Tarō on the back, and invited him to Ryūgū-jō  (竜宮城 - Dragon Palace) in the sea.<br/><br/>In Ryūgū-jō, Tarō was welcomed by the beautiful princess, Otohime (乙姫), and he enjoyed fish dancing and gorgeous food.<br/><br/>To be continued later.

Recently I have come to drink a lot of carbonated water.<br/><br/>Carbonated water, which you might call it sparkling water, is water containing carbon dioxide gas.<br/><br/>The reason why I drink carbonated water is because I want to feel something like coolness.<br/><br/>According to the Internet, there are several advantages and disadvantages about carbonated water.<br/><br/>As the advantages, it can promote blood flow and recover fatigue.<br/><br/>As disadvantages, if you drink it too much, you may feel tired and your body may become swollen.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether these information is true or false, but indeed I've felt tired recently.

Last week, I bought Microsoft HoloLens by using my research expense.<br/><br/>HoloLens is a head mounted display for MR (Mixed Reality).<br/><br/>Here, MR is a technology to show a new real world in which digital contents are embedded in real time.<br/><br/>You can also say that MR is a technology made by evolving AR (Argmented Reality), which is used in applications such as "Pokémon GO."<br/><br/>For example, since MR considers distances to real objects, virtual objects placed behind obstacles such as a desk would not be displayed on the HoloLens.<br/><br/>It is a very interesting technology, but I feel that it takes some time to get used to use it.

Today, a mid-term graduation research presentation (poster presentation) of senior students was held in my university.<br/><br/>I was very busy because I had to prepare and manage the venue, collect and arrange Fast Forward (1 minute presentations for posters), and go out for giving a class several times.<br/><br/>Yesterday, I was working until midnight, and finally stayed at my university.<br/><br/>It was a very difficult day, but the presentation went very well, so I'm satisfied.<br/><br/>However, although there were many interesting posters, I could check only some of them because of my class.<br/><br/>I have a regret only about that.

Yesterday, I bought Splatoon 2 and played it.<br/><br/>Since I have watched playing videos of the previous title several times, I understand some strategies, but I couldn't move the character as I thought.<br/><br/>Especially in match battles with other players, I was badly defeated.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I became a 3D sickness by using the gyro operation, so I felt very bad.<br/><br/>It was fun, but it may not suitable for my body.<br/><br/>I hope that I get used to the three dimensional movement in the near future...<br/><br/>From now on, I will play this game for one hour or less a day.

Today was a holiday, so I went to Nagano Prefecture with my friends.<br/>(We really love Nagano.)<br/><br/>Originally, we planned to climb a mountain, but we changed to go to Narai-juku because of the bad weather.<br/><br/>Narai-juku is an inn town that has flourished with a lot of travelers, and traditional Japanese buildings and houses still remain there as Groups of Traditional Buildings.<br/><br/>Since there are many shops that sell traditional things, such as woodworks, lacquerware and local foods, we could enjoy a lot.<br/><br/>After that, we went to "Tateshina Amusement Suizokukan," which is a aquarium located in the highest attitude in the world.<br/><br/>It was relatively small aquarium with only freshwater fish, but it was interesting because there were a lot of unusual fish.<br/><br/>It was a fulfilling day, however I got caught in a terrible traffic jam on my way home, I was really exhausted.

Today I finally finished watching the TV drama, Friends, from season one to ten.<br/><br/>Since all characters has grown nicely through the ten years, I feel nostalgic when I think back on the first season.<br/><br/>I watched all episodes with Japanese subtitles, but from now on, I will watch them again from the first episode with English subtitles.<br/><br/>Incidentally, one episode of this drama is about 22 minutes, and there were totally 238 episodes, so it means that I watched them for a total of about 87 hours.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is said that you need about 500 hours listening if you want to an acquire English ability that is enough to travel abroad.<br/><br/>The milestone will be attained if I watch all episodes six times, but it looks like a tough road.

Yesterday, I participated in a wedding party of my college friend.<br/><br/>It was really nice and I enjoyed meeting and talking with my friends from college for the first time in a long time.<br/><br/>In my yesterday's post, I wrote that about 30% of couples who didn't hold a wedding ceremony divorced, but this was wrong.<br/><br/>I'm sorry.<br/><br/>The fact is that about 30% of all Japanese couples divorce.<br/><br/>Also, according to a survey, about 80% of the divorced couples didn't hold a wedding ceremony.<br/><br/>Since about half of Japanese couples don't hold a wedding ceremony, this survey suggests that people who don't hold a wedding ceremony tend to divorce.<br/><br/>On the other hand, according to the study at Emory University, people who spend a lot of money on their wedding seem to tend to divorce.

Today I will go to my friend's party associated with his marriage.<br/><br/>(I will be careful not to drink too much.)<br/><br/>Recently in Japan, about half of married couples don't hold a wedding ceremony.<br/><br/>The main reason is because it costs too much money or it's difficult to prepare for it.<br/><br/>Also, from the same reasons, couples that hold a small wedding ceremony with only their relatives have increased.<br/><br/>My friend and his partner belong to such a couple -- today's party is just a party with their friends to celebrate their marriage, which is not a wedding ceremony.<br/><br/>Maybe you should consider a wedding ceremony, because I found several interesting information: about 90% of couples who held a wedding ceremony were satisfied it; about 30% of couples who didn't held a wedding ceremony divorced; almost all women have a longing for a wedding ceremony.

Today is Haha no Hi (Mother's Day) to express appreciation to the mother.<br/><br/>In many countries such as the US, Australia, Germany, Brazil, China and Japan, the second Sunday in May is Mother's Day.<br/><br/>However, the origin and the date of Mother's Day are different in many countries.<br/><br/>For example, Mother's Day is: the first Sunday in May in Spain and South Africa, the last Sunday in May in France, Sweden and Morocco, the third Sunday in October in Argentina, and the last Sunday in November in Russia.<br/><br/>In Japan, Mother's Day was March 6, but it didn't spread.<br/><br/>After that, an event to honor the mother was held on May 8, which became a trigger, and finally the second Sunday in May became Mother's Day after the fashion of the US.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I completely forgot the Mother's Day this year.<br/><br/>I ordered flowers just few hours ago, but it may not reach today.

Now it is a golden week (a cluster of holidays) in Japan.<br/><br/>Today, I climbed at Takao-san in Hachioji city.<br/><br/>The mountain is only 599 meters high, but it is located not far from the center of Tokyo, a lot of people visit there.<br/><br/>There are about five climbing routes, and almost all of them take one and half to two hours.<br/><br/>Since there are also cable cars and lifts, you can arrive at near the mountain's summit easily if you use them.<br/><br/>Although it was the first time for me to climb at this mountain, I chose a relatively hard route.<br/><br/>However, I was really terribly tired because I haven't do exercise recently.

Yesterday, I was feeling nauseous all day since I woke up in the morning.<br/><br/>Although I felt like hell, a convivial gathering between teachers and  freshmen was planned, so I managed to go to my university.<br/><br/>However, the symptom gradually worsened, and I vomited all things that I ate and drank.<br/><br/>Even when I was sitting or lying down, it was very painful.<br/><br/>With great disappointment, I decided to give up to participate in the party and go home quietly because I was afraid to transfer my disease or virus to someone.<br/><br/>In this day, I couldn't post my entry on Lang-8.<br/><br/>Fortunately, as a result of not eating anything a day, I am feeling better now.

Yesterday, adoption results of kakenhi were published.<br/><br/>"Kakenhi" is one of the most famous competitive research funds in Japan.<br/><br/>Although my previous application was rejected, I brushed up the it and applied almost the same theme again.<br/><br/>If this application were also rejected, I would receive the fact that my theme has no value, and consider changing the theme.<br/><br/>Therefore, I was pretty nervous.<br/><br/>However, my application was adopted and research funding will be paid, so I am very happy now.<br/><br/>I have been spent poor research life so far, but I will somewhat be better financially in the future.

Today a graduation ceremony took place at my university.<br/><br/>Students who would graduate were wearing hakama (Japanese skirts or culottes) or suits, and they looked excited.<br/><br/>The graduation ceremony ended in the morning, and the conferment of degree was conducted at each laboratory from the afternoon.<br/><br/>After that we took pictures with everybody, and each of us made some comments, then my boss and I presented memorabilia to the students. <br/><br/>I was about to cry due to the reaction of the students, but I bit the inside of my cheeks.<br/><br/>The day when students that I taught for one year as a teacher graduated and got out into the world was deeply emotional for me.

Today I participated in an academic conference.<br/><br/>Several students that I taught planned to do their poster presentations, and I planned to go the venue as an accompanying person of them.<br/><br/>However, two of them were absent, so I had to do poster presentations on behalf of them.<br/><br/>Since one poster session took one and a half hours, I explained their studies patiently for a total of three hours.<br/><br/>Now I am a state of "heto heto."<br/><br/>"Heto heto" is a term that means an exhausted condition,  but the etymology isn't clear.<br/><br/>A theory insists that "heto heto" comes from the last two characters of "i ro ha ni ho he to," which is a traditional Japanese poem called "Iroha Uta."

I bought a wrist watch at an outlet mall yesterday.<br/><br/>It was a little expensive, but I'm quite satisfied because I could bought my favorite design on sale.<br/><br/>According to the British institution YouGov, more than half of people between 16 to 34 use mobile phones as a way of knowing the time.<br/><br/>Also, according to a questionnaire survey by a Japanese company, about one third business people between 20s to 30s go work without wearing watches.<br/><br/>It is thought that the number of young people who don't wear watches has rapidly increased due to the spread of mobile phones.<br/><br/>In fact, I normally didn't wear a watch very much.<br/><br/>However, recently somehow I came to have an urge of wearing good watches.<br/><br/>Someday I would like to buy a more classy watch.

Today I went to the University of Tokyo to give a seminar.<br/><br/>As it happens, today was a day for the announcement of those who passed the university, so there were many students.<br/><br/>I thought that youth and vigorous energy were nice with a feeling of "shinmiri."<br/><br/>"Shinmiri" is a word that represents a deep feeling or a loneliness feeling.<br/><br/>In the seminar, I presented the results of my study to university teachers and companies.<br/><br/>Since I could get various questions and opinions to my study, it was a very nice opportunity for me.<br/><br/>I will do my study more from now on.

Today's morning I went to Begijnhof in Leuven, which is a world heritage.<br/><br/>It was very beautiful cityscape, and I felt happy.<br/><br/>After the sightseeing, I did some shopping for chocolates in Leuven, then took a train toward to the airport.<br/><br/>However, I accidentally took a wrong train, so it took an extra one hour to get to the airport.<br/><br/>Since I acted early just to be safe, I was able to arrive in time.<br/><br/>In duty free shops in Brussels National Airport, I bought more chocolates.<br/><br/>After the shopping, I departed for Dubai.<br/><br/>In Dubai International Airport, which is an airline hub, I bought more chocolates.

In the early morning, I left from Dubai International Airport to Narita Airport.<br/><br/>I rode the airplane for about eight hours, then arrived at Narita at just 17 o'clock.<br/><br/>Since I sat for a long time, I was really tired.<br/><br/>After riding the airplane, I rode a bus to back to my apartment.<br/><br/>At last, at around 21 o'clock, I came back.<br/><br/>In the moment when I opened the door of my apartment, I was filled with a sense of accomplishment.<br/><br/>However, my first thought after entering my room is "Oh, my feet are very stinky."<br/><br/>I immediately took a bus.<br/><br/>Then I put my shoes in ziplock and put them in a freezer.

Today I prepared my luggage from the morning and departed for Narita Airport by limousine bus around noon.<br/><br/>After I arrived at Narita Airport around the evening,  changed some Japanese yen to euro, then ate seafood rice bowl.<br/><br/>Although here is Japan, it is an airport, so I hear foreign languages from various places.<br/><br/>When I heard a fluent English conversation, I thought that it is impossible for me, then I felt uneasy.<br/><br/>I am nervous whether or not my clumsy English would convey the meaning in Belgium.<br/><br/>By the way, I am now making my presentation material at the airport lounge because there was a lot of time till check-in time of my flight.

Today the first graduation research presentations since I became a teacher at a university were held.<br/><br/>The seniors presented their graduation research with all their strength.<br/><br/>It was a very fulfilling day.<br/><br/>At that time, I was feeling a bit happy and a bit sad -- it was complicated.<br/><br/>After the research presentation, we had a job-well-done party.<br/><br/>Actually, I will leave Japan tomorrow in order to participate in an international conference that will held in Belgium.<br/><br/>However, since I haven't finished making my presentation material yet, maybe I shouldn't have joined the party.<br/><br/>The airplane will be a battlefield for me.

At the university where I work, today was a deadline for graduation thesis.<br/><br/>Students have been writing their theses all over creation for the last couple of days.<br/><br/>Yesterday, I had to help students' studies until late at night.<br/><br/>It was hell in many ways and I was exhausted.<br/><br/>Since the entrance gate closes during the midnight, I could not go home and I had to stay the night at my university.<br/><br/>Next, students will prepare for the graduation research presentation, which will be held in two weeks.<br/><br/>I sincerely want students to prepare for the presentation as early as possible.

The National Center Test for University Admissions has been held since yesterday in Japan.<br/><br/>This test is something like a common preliminary exam, which is necessary for entering Japanese national universities.<br/><br/>Lately, the number of private universities that evaluates the results of this test has been increased.<br/><br/>This test has several characteristics -- all problems are tested using computer-scored answer sheets, and IC players are used in the listening exam.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, since the test is held in winter every day, several students can't arrive at the venue due to snow.<br/><br/>I hope that this day will cause a good result for many students.

<div class="date">Dec 29, 2016 11:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday I wrote about "mochitsuki" (rice cake pounding).<br/><br/>Today I will talk about the proverb "e ni kaita mochi", which includes the word "mochi".<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "e ni kaita mochi" is "a rice cake drawn in a picture", and it means that something is totally useless or there is no possibility to realize something, even if it looks/sounds good.<br/><br/>This proverb comes from the fact that even if you can draw mochi (rice cake) in a picture very well, you can't eat it, and it is not useful.<br/><br/>The etymology is the Chinese word "gabei", ("ga" means "picture" and "bei" means "mochi") which can be found in Sangokushi.

Today I went to a professor's house and did mochitsuki.<br/><br/>The literal meaning of mochitsuki is "rice cake pounding", and it is a traditional Japanese event that is held around the new year.<br/><br/>In the mochituki, we pound boiled rice using a mortar and a pestle, and make mochi (sticky rice cake). <br/><br/>Unfortunately, since I had less stamina, physical strength, and experience, I couldn't pound mochi well.<br/><br/>On the other hand, professors and associate professors were getting used to the action, and they pounded mochi skillfully.<br/><br/>I could not contribute much to making mochi, but I ate very delicious mochi after the mochitsuki.

Today is Christmas Eve.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there remains a work of proofreading students' graduation theses.<br/><br/>At first I was correcting PDF files by using Adobe Acrobat, but it was hard because there were many points that have to be modified.<br/><br/>Therefore, I decided to purchase iPad Pro and Apple Pencil, and use them to correct theses.<br/><br/>Immediately I'm working with these devices.<br/><br/>The hard works became easy and fun.<br/><br/>Actually, I thought a MacBook Pro was a Christmas gift to myself, but it has keyboard trouble and I decided to return it, so the iPad Pro became a true Christmas gift of this year.

<div class="date">Nov 24, 2016 17:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
It snowed today in the Kanto region in Japan.<br/><br/>It is the first time in 54 years that the first snow falls in November in Tokyo, so this weather is really rare.<br/><br/>Since I didn't change my car tires to snow tires, I had to go to work by train.<br/><br/>As expected, the train was very crowded, and it made me tired.<br/><br/>Also, it's still the autumn color season, so we can see the scenery that snows are piled up on autumn leaves.<br/><br/>I'm feeling a little strange.<br/><br/>It might become more beautiful as more snows are piled up, but I hope that they will melt quickly so that I can commute to work smoothly.

Yesterday I took a big mistake.<br/><br/>Although I continued posting English sentences on Lang-8 every day more than 700 days, it ended yesterday.<br/><br/>I wrote an article as always, and I believed that I pushed the "Publish" button.<br/><br/>However, the action didn't work.<br/><br/>I don't understand whether the reason was network failure or my mistake.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm very sad.<br/><br/>A blank day was created on the calendar of Lang-8.<br/><br/>In fact, however, there is the fact that I have continued learning English every day.<br/><br/>I'm feeling regret for my blunder, but I will keep doing my study from now on also.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the phrase "yubi wo kuwaeru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of this phrase is "to put one's finger in one's mouth," and it expresses a state that someone envies other people/things but can't get them.<br/><br/>Actually I searched for the etymology, but it was not exist on the Internet.<br/><br/>Note that the following sentences are just my thought.<br/><br/>It is said that one of the reasons why babies and young children put their fingers in their mouths is to disguise their hunger.<br/><br/>It looks like they envy dishes but can't get them, so eat their fingers instead.<br/><br/>From such a scene, I think that this phrase has come to express the above meaning.

This is my 700th post.<br/><br/>When I was thinking "hmm, what should I write about today," I found that the number of my entries written is 699.<br/><br/>I am a little relieved because I don't need to search for today's topic.<br/><br/>I have managed to continue posting on Lang-8 every day, but recently, it has come to take a long time to choose a topic.<br/><br/>I think that I already wrote about most trivia, Japanese cultures and phrases that I know.<br/><br/>It's a difficult problem to search for topics.<br/><br/>Since I will go to Belgium to perform my presentation on a conference next February, maybe I should improve my speaking and listening skills instead of writing.

The day before yesterday was my mother's birthday.<br/><br/>Since I remembered that my mother said that she wanted to go traveling, I decided to give her a travel ticket.<br/><br/>By using this ticket, you can visit various locations of home and abroad.<br/>(It's difficult to travel abroad in terms of the value of the ticket which I bought, though.)<br/><br/>However, I wasn't able to prepare it well in advance, so the shipping date became three days ago (the day before her birthday).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the day when my mother received my gift was yesterday night (the day after her birthday).<br/><br/>It was a little bit disappointing, but I was pleased because she looked delighted.

Today, my laboratory members and I held imoni kai, the literal meaning of which is "stewed potato party."<br/><br/>Imoni kai is a traditional Japanese party that people make a nabe (pot) dish using taro and eat it in a river bed, and this party is mainly held in the Tohoku region in Japan.<br/><br/>Since the harvest season of taro is around October, imoni kai is normally held in autumn.<br/><br/>There are various seasoning ways, and we made two types of them: "Tonjiru-style"(which is seasoned like miso soup) and "Sukiyaki-style" (which is seasoned with soy source and sugar).<br/><br/>It was a hard work because we had to make furnaces by assembling stones.<br/><br/>However, both styles were really delicious and I was satisfied.

<div class="date">Aug 29, 2016 20:29</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, a really sad thing happened to me.<br/><br/>Hence I will talk about two Japanese expressions of sadness.<br/><br/>"Ten o aogu" ･･･ The literal meaning is "to look up to the sky."<br/><br/>This phrase expresses a person who trying to call for something on the God due to despair or grief.<br/><br/>"Unadareru" ･･･ The literal meaning is "to bow one's nape of the neck."<br/><br/>This phrase expresses a person dropping his/her head due to despair, sadness, or embarrassment.<br/><br/>Both of these expressions mean a kind of sadness, but the direction of the face is opposite to each other.

<div class="date">Aug 28, 2016 16:14</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I tried to solve exam problems of Japanese language on the Internet.<br/><br/>However, I made one mistake among five problems in the second grades.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe that foreign people trying to take N2 solve such difficult problems, but it was not "Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT)," but "The Japanese Language Examination" for native Japanese people.<br/><br/>To be honest, I'm relieved.<br/><br/>By the way, the problem that I made a mistake is related to "閑話休題 (kanwa kyudai)."<br/><br/>"閑話" means "digression," "休題" means "to stop the topic," and "閑話休題" means "to return to the main topic from the digression," which is translated as "but I digress" in English.<br/><br/>However, I thought that "閑話休題" means "to stray from the main topic and make a digression," which is something like "by the way" or "as an aside."<br/><br/>I heard that many Japanese people have misunderstood as I did, but I'd like to be more careful.

<div class="date">Aug 21, 2016 10:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese phrase "pin kara kiri made," which means "from the first to the last" / "whole gamut."<br/><br/>The "pin" comes from the Portuguese "pinta," which means "point."<br/><br/>This became to express "one" of a dice, then became to mean "the first" or "the best."<br/><br/>The "kiri" means "the last" or "the worst."<br/><br/>There are two theories about the etymology: one is that it comes from the Portuguese "cruz," which means "cross," and the other is that it comes from the Japanese "kagiri," which means "limit."<br/><br/>Recently, Japanese people often say just "pin kiri" for short.

For many Japanese people, Bon holidays will end today.<br/><br/>Therefore, people who returned home will come back to areas where they currently work.<br/><br/>Of course, this will cause major traffic jams all over Japan.<br/><br/>By the way, it is said that most traffic jams on Japanese highways occur in sag sections, where the slope is changed from a decline to a uprise.<br/><br/>Actually, I also had to come back to Tokyo today.<br/><br/>However, since I really don't like traffic jams, I set off at around 2:30 A.M., and arrived at around 6:30 A.M.<br/><br/>I will go to bed from now until noon.

Today, I'd like to write the remaining part of yesterday's post.<br/><br/>The second sightseeing spot where I visited was "Unagi Pie Factory."<br/><br/>Unagi means eels, and unagi pie is confectionery created by kneading eel powders into pie dough, which is popular as a souvenir in Shizuoka Prefecture.<br/>(It doesn't have a taste of eels at all.)<br/><br/>At the Unagi Pie Factory, you can see and learn the manufacturing process of unagi pie.<br/><br/>Although it was a short factory tour, I was fun.<br/><br/>I bought a lot of unagi pie as a souvenir.<br/><br/>After that, I returned home, then played with my nephew and niece.<br/><br/>Since I also played with them, I'm exhausted.

Since there is a McDonald in my university, I sometimes go there and buy McShake.<br/><br/>McShake is known that it's hard to drink, but there is a reason.<br/><br/>According to the McDonald's study, the most delicious speed that you feel when you drink something is same as the speed of drinking breast milk.<br/><br/>The diameter of the McShake's straw is adjusted to achieve the breast milk speed.<br/><br/>When you drink McShake, you might recall the days when you were babies unconsciously.<br/><br/>Furthermore, you might demand it instinctively.<br/><br/>McShake could be a kind of drug.

Yesterday, I bought an iPad mini 4.<br/><br/>The storage size is 64 GB, the color is gold, and it's a cellular model.<br/><br/>Although there were rumors about iPad Pro mini and iPad mini 5, I couldn't wait for the next version to be available.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed manipulating this device yesterday.<br/><br/>Also, I played a game (Kingdom Rush Origins) for the first time in a long time, and kept late hours.<br/><br/>I'm sleepy now.

It was when I was leaving a fast food restaurant after I ate dinner, I found a cockroach in the outside.<br/><br/>It was very shocking to me.<br/><br/>I've never found cockroaches while living in Nagano Prefecture, and I met a cockroach for the first time in nine years.<br/><br/>For now, I've never found cockroach in my apartment, but my room doesn't clean very much.<br/><br/>I think that my kitchen is very clean (because I don't cook very much), but there are many cardboard boxes in my room.<br/><br/>Also, I heard that cockroaches like cardboard, and they often deposit their eggs in cardboard boxes.<br/><br/>In order to avoid cockroaches, I will do something with those cardboard boxes.

Yesterday, I went to an outlet mall, and bought some clothes after I finished my work.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I chose and bought a cloth for myself.<br/><br/>I think it's the first in 2 years.<br/><br/>I bought a thin jacket and, some shirts and pants.<br/><br/>Recently, I've worn a few clothes in rotation, so such new clothes will be a good refreshing change for me.<br/><br/>My colleagues might have thought something like "you always wear the same cloth," haha.

Today, I walked a very long distance.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, since I wore unfamiliar shoes, I got a blister.<br/><br/>My skin was barked, and it hurts.<br/><br/>If you ignore your shoe sore, your foot may become arteriosclerosis obliterans.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if you ignore the symptom, there is a risk that causes a myocardial infarction and a stroke.<br/><br/>Therefore, you should wear shoes that fits your feet, and walk with a correct posture.<br/><br/>By the way, since your feet become slightly swollen in the evening, it's better to choose your shoes based on your evening feet.

Today, I tried to assemble a desk, but I missed eight screws.<br/><br/>Therefore, I went to a hardware store to buy screws.<br/><br/>However, I forgot to measure the exact diameter of the missing screws, and I struggled to buy which size.<br/><br/>Sensuously, I thought the size was 4 to 5 mm, and I bought eight screws of M4 and M5, respectively.<br/><br/>Since the hardware store was far from my apartment, I didn't want to go there again.<br/><br/>So just in case, I also bought some other screws that have different length.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the diameter of the screw hole was 6 mm.<br/><br/>Begrudgingly, I went to the hardware store again.<br/><br/>I will measure with a caliper in advance.

Today, a graduate research seminar was held with my boss and students.<br/><br/>There were fifteen students, and it was difficult for me to remember all of their names.<br/><br/>However, I could remember easily some individualistic students' names.<br/><br/>Also, we held a drinking party at night.<br/><br/>Since I was able to talk with various nice people, I think it was a profitable time.<br/><br/>One disappointing point was that I couldn't finish the party smoothly because of my bad closing speech.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd like to support their graduation researches earnestly from now on.

Today, I bought the latest model washing machine, and tried to install it in my apartment.<br/><br/>It is a drum-type washing machine, which can perform the laundry process from washing and drying automatically.<br/><br/>Since I wanted to stick to washing machines, I chose a high performance and expensive one among those that have been sold to public.<br/><br/>I couldn't pay for the machine in one payment, so I bought it on an installment plan.<br/><br/>I was so excited.<br/><br/>However, the door width to the washing room was too narrow to carry the washing machine.<br/><br/>I got depressed.<br/><br/>Today, I couldn't install it, but fortunately I found that the door is removable, so I will try to install it again at a later date.

<div class="date">Mar 7, 2016 17:49</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I held a Java workshop at my university.<br/><br/>Fourteen people participated in the workshop, and it took about three hours.<br/><br/>The purpose of the workshop was to make a drawing software using Java.<br/><br/>However, it was difficult to progress while checking the progress of everyone, so I couldn't achieve my plan.<br/><br/>The second workshop will be held on this Friday.<br/><br/>I'd like to reconsider how I should progress the workshop by next time.

Today, I conducted the accomplishment report of my venture activity at the year-end meeting.<br/><br/>Since this presentation was the compilation of my student life, I was a little nervous, but it went smoothly.<br/><br/>In the social gathering, I presented commemorative gifts to teachers and staffs who supported me, and conveyed to them my sincere appreciation.<br/><br/>When I saw one of them had tearful eyes, I almost cried too.<br/><br/>Also, many of them gave me words of encouragement, so I was impressed.<br/><br/>I'd like to push forward confidently toward my new goal.

Today, February 29th is a leap year.<br/><br/>I can write this sentence only once every four years.<br/><br/>I'll do my best so that I write "today is a leap year" on Lang-8 again.<br/><br/>The leap year has been established to correct deviations of the calendar, because one year is not 365 days, but about 365.2422 days.<br/><br/>In addition, in the Gregorian calendar, there are two other rules to correct subtle deviations due to leap years; if the year is divided by 100 then it's regarded as a common year, but if the year is divided by 400 then it's regarded as a leap year.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in the modified Julian calendar, if the year is divided by 100 then it's regarded as a common year, but if the remainder of the year when divided by 900 is 200 or 600 then the year is regarded as a leap year.<br/><br/>Both of them are very accurate calculation methods of the calendar, but the modified Julian calendar is more accurate.

Today, I searched for Sakha Republic, which is one of 85 federal subjects of the Russian Federation.<br/><br/>Since Sakha Republic has recorded minus 71.2 Celsius degrees, which is the world's lowest temperature except for Antarctica, it is thought of as the cold pole in the Northern Hemisphere.<br/><br/>Also, when the temperature goes below minus 50 degrees, schools seem to be closed.<br/><br/>I think there are little people who are sick, because disease-causing bacteria can't inhabit such cold regions.<br/><br/>However, the temperature seems to goes up to almost 30 degrees in summer.<br/><br/>By the way, Sakha Republic is famous for diamonds, and one fourth of diamonds in the worlds is mined in Sakha.<br/><br/>The number of countries where I want to go increased today.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I took a TOEIC exam.<br/><br/>Since it was the last TOEIC which I took as a university student, I hope that I can get a good score.<br/><br/>Also, I will graduate from my university after about two months, so no matter what I do, it might be the last action as a student.<br/><br/>I'd like to enjoy my last schooltime, so as not to leave regrets.<br/><br/>However, putting that aside, I have to overcome the dissertation presentation and the final examination of my doctoral program tomorrow.<br/><br/>If I cannot pass the exam, I must be a student for another half a year, haha.

Yesterday, I went home and was going to go to the toilet, but the water in the toilet had frozen.<br/><br/>Unless something is done, the water won't flow.<br/><br/>However, I noticed that the frozen area was only near the surface.<br/><br/>Therefore, I tried to pour boiled water into the frozen area several times, and after a while, finally the frozen water melted and flowed.<br/><br/>Somehow it worked.<br/><br/>If it was water-pipes in the kitchen or the bathroom, we could prevent them from freezing by continue to run slight water constantly, but it not valid for the toilet.<br/><br/>I have to consider solutions.

Under the influence of the cold wave, it seems to snow heavily and very cold in the northern hemisphere.<br/><br/>The region where I live is also cold especially today: the highest temperature is 1 Celsius degree, and the lowest temperature is -11 Celsius degrees.<br/><br/>However, fortunately, there are little snow in this region.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in western Japan, since the temperature usually doesn't become too cold, troubles of water pipes freezing and rupturing seem to be occurred in a row.<br/><br/>I found a person who dived into snows in the nude on Twitter.<br/><br/>He tried to take a shower with warm water, but he couldn't because the water pipe froze.<br/><br/>Please be careful.

It was sunny yesterday, but today it snowed heavily again.<br/><br/>For sake of safety, I shoveled the snow in various places.<br/><br/>Actually, I wear sandals through a year, but a lot of snow got through my sandals and it was cold.<br/><br/>I think I was idiot.<br/><br/>Also, I got tired from shoveling.<br/><br/>I searched for shoveling later, and it was found that the knack is to use whole your body, and not to twist your torso.

Mario (proper name: Mario Mario) is the most famous game character in the world, which is created by Mr. Miyamoto.<br/><br/>According to Mr. Miyamoto, Mario is around 26 years old.<br/><br/>I had played various Mario games when I was a child, but I exceeded the age of Mario insidiously.<br/><br/>The age of Dr. Mario hasn't been revealed, but it seems to be thought that he is a little more elder, because he is a doctor.<br/><br/>The age of Princess Peach also hasn't been revealed, but her age seems to be similar to Mario's age, because when Mario is a baby in Mario &amp; Ruigi RPG 2, Peach is also a baby.

First Dream of the Year is called Hatsuyume in Japan.<br/><br/>Japanese people often forecast the year's fortune from the contents of Hatsuyume.<br/><br/>There is the saying "Ichi fuji ni taka san nasu," which represents highly auspicious tokens in Hatsuyume.<br/><br/>This means that the most auspicious one is Mount Fuji, the second one is a hawk, and the third one is an eggplant.<br/><br/>Also, dreams of death, disaster, excrement and blood also seem to auspicious.<br/><br/>On the other hand, dreams to be encouraged by oneself and to be chased seem to be bad.<br/><br/>In my Hatsuyume, I was riding my road bike with old friends.

Today, I finally bought a MacBook Air.<br/><br/>I ordered the MacBook last week, but it arrived today, because I added the memory and changed the keyboard layout, and the product had to be imported from Shanghai.<br/><br/>From now on, I can make presentation slides even if I'm staying at home.<br/><br/>At presentation venues, no longer need to use iPhone.<br/><br/>It's an early New Year's gift for myself.<br/><br/>I'm sorry this topic is unrelated to New Year's Eve.<br/><br/>Best wishes throughout the coming year (良いお年をお迎えください).

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to ask you a question about the word <em>sundry,</em> which I learned a little while ago.<br/><br/>According to my English word book, the meaning of <em>sundry</em> is almost the same as the one of  'various.'<br/><br/>Also, the Internet says that <em>sundry</em> means <em>various</em> in modern English.<br/><br/>Is it natural that using <em>sundry</em> instead of 'various'?<br/><br/>For example, I often write sentences like "various methods have been proposed," but can I rewrite this like "sundry methods have been proposed?"<br/><br/>I would really appreciate it if you could let me know about the nuances.

Have you ever eaten insects?<br/><br/>My hometown of Aichi Prefecture don't have a culture of insect food, while those living in Nagano Prefecture where now I live sometimes eat locusts and hachinoko(which means bee larvae).<br/><br/>In fact, cooked locusts and bee larvae are sold in grocery stores.<br/><br/>I have an experience of eating such insects, but the taste wasn't too bad.<br/><br/>However, only the taste of silkworms was hideous for me, so I will never eat them again.<br/><br/>In the former Nagano Prefecture, since these insects were valuable protein sources, eating them was very important.

Lately, I have learned 40-60 English words everyday using an online learning site of my university.<br/><br/>And yesterday, the number of words that I learned finally reached 10000.<br/><br/>There remains only other 2000 words.<br/><br/>However, as the number increases, the difficulty also increases, so now the learning takes a lot of time and is a little painful to me.<br/><br/>Today, I try to make a sentence using some words that I learned a little while ago so as not to forget them.<br/><br/>"The dingy and abominable bureaucrat spat out hackneyed epithets in a circumspect way."<br/><br/>

Today, my associate and I bought a Dolce Gusto that readily makes coffee manufactured by Nescafe.<br/><br/>By setting a capsule and touching a button, we can brew a variety of drinks such as coffee, cafe au lait, or cappuccino.<br/><br/>After buying the Dolce Gusto, we immediately placed it in our laboratory, and I tried drinking coffee and cappuccino.<br/><br/>Although I don't have a thorough knowledge of coffee, I felt they were mild and delicious.<br/><br/>In the days ahead, I will be looking forward to drinking a cup of coffee after lunch.

I had set alarm on my phone for early this morning.<br/><br/>And this morning, as soon as the alarm rang, I stopped the sound by pressing the power button.<br/><br/>However, after the sound stopped, I thought "hmm? Was the sound the ring alert?," and I got into a flurry.<br/><br/>Then, I immediately called someone back from the list of received calls, but the person at the other end of the line seemed to be confused..<br/><br/>I was still only half awake, and dreaming.<br/><br/>The ring alert and the alarm sound were just the same, and there was no calling.<br/><br/>I was a little embarrassed.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I bought a gadget "Boogie Board Sync" created by KINGJIM.<br/><br/>This is a simple electronic notebook, and you can save what you wrote with one touch of a button.<br/><br/>Immediately I used it, then I found that it was a little difficult to read what I wrote on account of the contrast, but it was not a big problem.<br/><br/>However, after a short time, I noticed that the drawing color changed to dark blue on regions far from the center (especially on the upper part).<br/><br/>Since the background color of the board is black, the dark blue color is really hard to read.<br/><br/>Now, I'm making an inquiry to the company to see whether this is a specification or not.

I often go back to sleep after waking up.<br/><br/>It is thought that since going back to sleep become light sleep, and stimuli from outsides become mild, it feels good.<br/><br/>However, I actually want to get up early, so I searched for methods to prevent from it.<br/><br/>According to the Internet, it seems good to move your body forcibly and drink a glass of water.<br/><br/><br/>I will try to do this from tomorrow.

Today I found "Japan KARAAGE Association" on the internet.<br/><br/>In the association, members have exchanged karaage information, and held karaage events (karaage is a popular fried food in Japan).<br/><br/>Actually, I love karaage, so I applied for the association by taking the karaage certificate exam.<br/><br/>Then, an acceptance letter arrived in my mailbox immediately, and I became a member of the association (called a karaagenist).<br/><br/>If given the chance, I'd like to participate in karaage events, and eat a lot of karaage.

Yesterday, I reached 300th post.<br/><br/>I had written about the number of my posts every 100 posts, but I completely forgot it yesterday.<br/><br/>Therefore, sadly this is the 301st post.<br/><br/>So far, I have somehow kept the ratio of the number of my posts to the number of my corrections.<br/><br/>From now on also, I would like to keep my itsy-bitsy work.

It has proven scientifically that writing a diary is good for you.<br/><br/>In particular, it can restore your mental balance.<br/><br/>If it was a bad day, I would write the detail on my diary, and recover myself.<br/><br/>However, it's difficult to keep a diary for many people.<br/><br/>In such cases, please try to keep a diary for three weeks (it's also okay if the diary is only one line) .<br/><br/>In the field of brain science, it's said that if you continue to do something for three weeks, it will be your habit.

Today, I went to a photo studio, and had my photograph for my resume taken.<br/><br/>Actually, I previously used a photo taken with an iPhone by my friend.<br/><br/>However, my teacher said "since your photo will be checked finely, it should be taken in the appropriate place," so I decided to go to the photo studio.<br/><br/>In the photo studio, the owner checked many things, such as my posture, direction of my eyes, my tie, and wrinkle in my shirt.<br/><br/>It took a little money, but a very nice photographs was printed.<br/><br/>This makes me feel as if I can do well at my job hunting.

The following sentences will be posted on my homepage. I would like to create English version page, so I would appreciate it if you could correct my sentences.<br/><br/>These days, I write some sentences in English every day on a language exchange social networking website called Lang-8.  At first, I had mainly wrote my diary, but gradually what I write about was rolling away, and I began to write trivial things in English. Since the trivia has been piled up, I have a mind to post it in two languages (Japanese/English) for myself in my study. Although these sentences were corrected by native speakers, there might be some parts that the nuances are different or some minor mistakes. If you noticed these points, it is much appreciated if you could advise me.

This month, two friends stayed over at my apartment.<br/><br/>However, both of them said that their throats feel sore when they woke up.<br/><br/>Apparently, there seemed to be a lot of house dust in my room, and the room seemed to be too dry.<br/><br/>So yesterday, I bought an air cleaner with humidification function.<br/><br/>This includes a duct sensor, and I can see the amount of dust in my room.<br/><br/>At first, it said that the amount of dust is less in my room, but the sensor reacted when I started to clean my room, and the air cleaning function was boosted automatically.<br/><br/>I will clean up my room frequently to prevent visitors from damaging their throats.

In Japan, we often say "ドンマイ(don-mai)," when we encourage people who made a mistake.<br/><br/>"ドンマイ" is the word derived from "( I ) don't mind" in English, but I learned that the nuance is different for Japanese and English.<br/><br/>English speakers seem to say "I don't mind" instead of "don't mind," but this doesn't mean to encourage someone.<br/><br/>"ドンマイ" in Japan is similar to "Never mind" and "Don't worry about it" in English.<br/><br/>Since there are several phrases whose nuances have changed by taking root in Japan, we have to be careful when we use them.

Today, I took the TOEIC test.<br/><br/>Since it was the first challenge in 8 months, I was a little excited.<br/><br/>However, unfortunately a person just behind me frequently coughed and sniffled loudly during the test.<br/><br/>I couldn't concentrate on the problems, because the loud noise was being emitted from close behind when I was listening and reading English.<br/><br/>Eventually, I wasn't able to answer around twenty problems, so the result could get worse than before.<br/><br/>I want to enhance my concentration against noises.

Today, I performed my presentation at the conference in the afternoon.<br/><br/>The presentation ended in peace, but I failed in the question-and-answer session.<br/><br/>Since I couldn't answer the question well, I was embarrassed.<br/><br/>After the conference, I had a drink with my teacher and friends in the city of Kyoto.<br/><br/>I met the friends after a long time, so it was fun.<br/>.<br/>Anyway, I am tired today.

Today, I participated in the academic conference from this morning.<br/><br/>There were many technical presentations, and I couldn't understand well some of them.<br/><br/>However, there were also many interesting presentations, which elevated my motivation.<br/><br/>Also, people in Osaka were very friendly and kind.<br/><br/>In addition, I felt their Kansai accent were cool and cute.<br/><br/>I'd like to come to this city again someday.<br/><br/>Before thinking such a thing, I have to prepare for tomorrow's my presentation right now.

Today, I got on a highway bus to Kyoto for seven hours, and got on a train to Osaka for one and half hours.<br/><br/>Since I get carsick easily, I was sleeping most of the time I was on the bus.<br/><br/>However, somehow I was very tired, so I slept again on arrival at a hotel.<br/><br/>I wonder how many time I can sleep.<br/><br/>I might not sleep tonight because of sleeping too much.

I use an snooze button of an alarm clock.<br/><br/>However, I found out that the snooze button derange your sleep cycle and biological clock, so it's not good for your health.<br/><br/>By using the snooze button, you will be "sleep inertia," which is something like spaced-out state.<br/><br/>Also, this will affect your work deeply over a day.<br/><br/>From now on, I will stop using the snooze button.

I have had a sore throat since yesterday, so I could have caught a cold.<br/><br/>At time like this, I found the information that a Coke is good for a cold.<br/><br/>According to the Internet, this information is common in the West (especially France), but I think most Japanese people don't know this.<br/><br/>Originally, the Coke had been released as a cold medicine.<br/><br/>Medical evidence has not been proven, but it seems to have effects, such as relaxation of headache and throat inflammation, and improvement of indigestion.<br/><br/>Today, I will buy and drink a Coke.<br/><br/>By the way, in Canada, a cold sufferer seems to drink Ginger Ale.

In this morning, I went to cycling with my friends.<br/><br/>The distance to the destination was about 40 km.<br/><br/>We ate brunch along the way, and came back around noon.<br/><br/>I ate Kamameshi, which is the famous menu in the land.<br/><br/>There were many variety of ingredients, such as an egg, mushrooms, bamboo shoots and chicken, on the rice.<br/><br/>However, I don't know why an apricot was also put on the rice.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I ate soba and ice cream for storing energy.<br/><br/>I am somewhat tired, but it was fun.

Today was bulky trash day for our university, and I enjoyed it because we could get the trash.<br/><br/>There were many nice bulky trash in the dumping ground, for example, Power Mac G4, G5, laptops of ASUS, and PCs of Dell.<br/><br/>Eventually, I got about ten PCs.<br/><br/>All the PCs were very old ones, but I like to fiddle around with old PCs, so I'm happy.<br/><br/>Also, my boss got a vacuum cleaner of Dyson.<br/><br/>He looks so happy.

Today, I found an interesting open/closed signs board.<br/><br/>The video is shown below.<br/><br/><object height="315" width="560">

<embed height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/OKWyqc0aWoQ" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560"/>
</object>
<br/><br/>As you can see, the word "close" changed into the word "open" by rotating the gears.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the character <em>d</em> changed to the eighth note, and the star changed to the sun.<br/><br/>It was so impressive to me, and I liked this gimmick.

In Japan, even if you lost your wallet, camera, or iPhone, there would be a very good chance that they will be found.<br/><br/>I think many Japanese people are willing to deliver such lost properties.<br/><br/>When I was young, I lost my wallet.<br/><br/>I felt sorrow, and cried, but immediately got a phone call from a police box.<br/><br/>"Did you lost your wallet?"<br/><br/>I was so happy, and at that moment, I vowed that I deliver lost properties when I find them.

Since it was fine morning, I rode my bicycle to a foot of a nearby mountain.<br/><br/>Although the cycling was a very short trip, I was able to refresh because I recently had had a lack of exercise .<br/><br/>The following picture is a spot in the neighborhood of my apartment.<br/><br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/ueda.jpg" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/ueda.jpg</a><br/><br/>It might be too rural, but I really like such sceneries surrounded by green.<br/><br/>By the way, this spot is close to the region, which was used as the setting of the Japanese animated movie "Summer Wars."

Today, I played "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword" after a long interval, and eventually finished it. <br/><br/>The game was difficult for me, especially the battle scene by shaking the Wii remote controller.<br/><br/>However, it was also exciting, challenging, funny, and filling.<br/><br/>Having now completed it, I feel great satisfaction.<br/><br/>Whew.<br/><br/>To tell the truth, this is not the time to play games anymore.<br/><br/>I have to progress my study for my future.<br/><br/>From now on, I seal off all games until the end of my job hunting.

Today, I finished making works on 3D printer.<br/><br/>I had wanted to create something like a shelf, but I failed.<br/><br/>Instead, I created cell phone stands like the following.<br/><br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/stand1.jpg" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/stand1.jpg</a><br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/stand2.jpg" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/stand2.jpg</a><br/><br/>Actually, I failed to complete works three or four times, so these are my first finished works!<br/><br/>I'm immature, but now I'm satisfied.<br/><br/>After this, I have to burr and rough these works.

Today, I set up and started a 3D printer.<br/><br/>It took about an hour to set it up.<br/><br/>And now, 3D printing is being executed.<br/><br/>I chose a shelf of key and wallet as my first 3D printing.<br/><br/>I'm excited.<br/><br/>However, it seems take about twenty four hours to complete.<br/><br/>Also, since it consumes electric power, I can't use an air conditioner.<br/><br/>It's hot, I'm melting.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it's noisy.<br/><br/>Ahh.

Yesterday, a super discount sale was held on Amazon.<br/><br/>My target was a MacBook Pro, and it was sold at 50% off in limited 100 units.<br/><br/>However, I couldn't buy it.<br/><br/>Instead, somehow I could buy a 3D printer called "Da Vinci Jr." at 90% off.<br/><br/>While the catalog price was 49,800 yen, the discount price was 4,980 yen.<br/><br/>I was thrilled, but after a while, I thought.<br/><br/>"I wonder if I wanted this?"<br/><br/>Tentatively, I will try to use a 3D CAD software, and create some objects by the 3D printer.

Today, I learned about etymologies of Greenland and Iceland.<br/><br/>Both of them were named by Erik the Red in the 10th century.<br/><br/>Firstly, he gave an island the name Iceland, and tried to marshal residents.<br/><br/>However, he couldn't gather a lot of people because of the island's name.<br/><br/>Next, he gave an island the name of Greenland from his failure, though there were almost no green in the island.<br/><br/>In other words, he lied.<br/><br/>Resultingly, he couldn't gather a lot of people to the island as well.<br/><br/>Iceland has a lot of green, and Greenland has a lot of ice.<br/><br/>These are so beautiful, so I want to go there someday.

Today, I learned a slang phrase 'jk (just kidding).'<br/><br/>In Japan, <em>jk</em> is also used as slang, and it has two meanings.<br/><br/>One is "high school girls (joshi kousei)," and the other is "by thinking it in common sense (joushikitekini kangaete)." <br/><br/>Therefore, I think I can say something like "JK! She's JK, JK. "<br/><br/>(Just kidding! She's a high school girl by thinking it in common sense.)<br/><br/>By the way, if we search <em>JK</em> on Google Images of the US, we can see a lot of pictures of J.K. Rowling.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if we search <em>JK</em> on Google Images of Japan, we can see a lot of high school girls.

Today, I had my friend take a photo for my resume.<br/><br/>We firstly used a single lens reflex camera, but it was not so great.<br/><br/>Next, we used iPhone 6's camera, and the result was somehow better.<br/><br/>So I decided to use the photo by iPhone.<br/><br/>However, since it was a little dark, I slightly adjusted the brightness.<br/><br/>I believe such a brightness adjustment is OK. Maybe.

Yesterday, I bought an Apple wireless keyboard (US) on the net auction.<br/><br/>The reason why I bought the US version keyboard is that just it looks cool.<br/><br/>In most of the Japanese keyboard, hiragana are printed, though we rarely use hiragana input system.<br/><br/>We mainly use romaji input system, so there is no need to be printed hiragana on keyboards.<br/><br/>Above all, keyboards that hiragana are printed don't look cool.<br/><br/>Now, I'm satisfied.

Today, I woke up early and went for a bike ride.<br/><br/>It was about 50 km each way.<br/><br/>On the way back home, I made a stop at a hot spring in the mountaintop.<br/><br/>I enjoyed a relaxing soak in the open-air bath.<br/><br/>This cycling took about 5 hours, and my feet are very sore now.

Today, I wrote a program source of Collatz Conjecture.<br/><br/>Although this is one of the unsolved problems in number theory, it's very simple.<br/><br/>For all natural number n, think that you do the following.<br/><br/>・If n is even number, divide n by two.<br/><br/>・If n is odd number, multiply n by three and add one to the result.<br/><br/>It has been expected that n will always reach one in a finite trial.<br/><br/>This problem has not been solved from about 80 years ago.<br/><br/>By using computer, it was confirmed that this conjecture is correct until about 10^18, but it does not much make sense.<br/><br/>I hope it will be solved during my life.

Today, an earthquake occurred around noon.<br/><br/>It was measured level two on the Japanese intensity scale.<br/><br/>In our laboratory, some said "it's shaking" or "oh, earthquake?" but most of us didn't mind it.<br/><br/>We are accustomed to such a little tremors.<br/><br/>However, I think we can move quickly and appropriately to big tremors, because we have trained for earthquakes since we were in elementary school.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I contracted with MVNO called IIJmio.<br/><br/>I can communicate 3GB data per month, by paying about 1000 yen.<br/><br/>The reason for this contract is to watch dramas at a sports gym.<br/><br/>I soon went to the gym, and watched TBBT season 5 on Hulu while riding a static bike.<br/><br/>One episode of the drama required about 40MB data communication, so I can watch about 75 episodes.<br/><br/>Also, the fee of one episode is corresponding to about 13 yen.

I uninstalled Windows 10 Technical Preview from my PC and reinstalled Windows 8.<br/><br/>I liked the design of Windows 10, but I couldn't do my work well because the OS  frequently froze.<br/><br/>It took about 5 hours to reinstall the OS and softwares.<br/><br/>From this time, I'd like to refrain from jumping at anything new.

<div class="date">May 11, 2015 20:00</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I had itchy throat.<br/><br/>I thought I caught a cold, but I also had a itchy eyes, so this was probably cedar pollen allergy.<br/><br/>A cedar pollen allergy is the most common pollen allergy in Japan, and it is said that there are about 25 million people (almost 20% of the population) who suffer from it.<br/><br/>The reason why there are so many cedar pollen allergy sufferer in Japan is that we have planted a large amount of cedars since the WW2 for the restoration.<br/><br/>Cedars are have a high growth rate and possess high value as building materials.<br/><br/>However, since they also have shedded their pollens too much, most Japanese people became cedar pollen allergy sufferers.<br/><br/>Sometimes, the pollens reach the 300 km away from the planted place.<br/><br/>Therefore, the cedar pollen count becomes part of the daily weather report during this time of year.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Japan is planning to cut down the cedars, and replant the other trees that have less pollens from this year.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the next year.

Today is the last day of Japanese long-term holidays, but I was writing my graduation thesis in English as well as yesterday.<br/><br/>Since there are so many technical terms in the thesis, I'm concerned about whether my sentences make sense.<br/><br/>Therefore, when I finish writing the thesis, I will ask native experts to correct.<br/><br/>It costs 12 yen per one word, so one page that was written about 500 words cost about 6,000 yen.<br/><br/>It seems my doctoral thesis be more than 100 pages (because my master's thesis was about 100 pages), when I ask to correct all the pages, it will cost more than 600,000 yen.<br/><br/>I don't know whether this price is expensive or not, but maybe I should invest such money for writing a good doctoral thesis.

Today, I woke up at 5:00 a.m., and I climbed a hill riding my road bike.<br/><br/>I patiently climbed 30 km, and took a little rest when I arrived to the top of the mountain, and descended 30 km. <br/><br/>Although roads that lead to the top were concreted, it was really hard to climb because the roads had some steep slopes.<br/><br/>However, there was not a single cloud in the blue sky, so I felt so good.

Yesterday, Apple Watch was launched and an Japanese TV show was introducing it.<br/><br/>In order to try voice recognition function, an announcer said 「ここのところ押しますよ、『今どこにいるんですか』」（"I will push this point, 『where are you right now?』"） while pushing Apple Watch's button.<br/><br/>He wanted to display 「今どこにいるんですか」(where are you right now?) on the Apple Watch, but the watch also caught 「ころ押しますよ」, and the sentence「殺しますよ、今どこにいるんですか」("I will kill you, where are you right now?") was displayed.<br/><br/>This is a horrible sentence.

Today, I was asked to take CT scan of a bathynomus doederleini from a teacher.<br/><br/>The teacher is studying at woodlice and bathynomus doederleini, and he wanted to observe the inner of them.<br/><br/>I could obtain the 3D outer shape of the bathynomus doederleini by CT imaging, however, the inner structure was not clear.<br/><br/>Bathynomus doederleini and bathynomus giganteus are sorts of benthic feeder, and since they eat carcasses such as a dead fish, they are described as cleaners in the sea.<br/><br/>They have resistance to starvation, for example, a bathynomus giganteus in a Japanese aquarium had lived more than five years without any foods.<br/><br/>(Somehow, the bathynomus giganteus didn't try to eat something.)<br/><br/>He died during the sixth year, but the cause of death is sickness.<br/><br/>It remains a mystery that the reason why they can live without foods.

Today, it was temporarily downpour.<br/><br/>In English, there are some phrases that means rain hard:<br/><br/>・It's raining cats and dogs.<br/>・It's coming down in buckets.<br/>・It's really coming down.<br/>・It's pouring.<br/>・It is the heavens open.<br/><br/>There are various hypotheses about why "cats and dogs" means hard rain, but one of the most widely-accepted theory come from Scandinavian myth.<br/><br/>In Scandinavian myth, it is said that cats have a power to cause rains, and dogs have a power to cause winds.<br/><br/>In fact in many European countries, the bad weather was referred to as "dog(wolf) weather."<br/><br/>Also, while "cats and dogs" means bad relationship in English, "dogs and monkeys relationship" means bad relationship in Japan.

Subarachnoid Hemorrhage<br/>くも膜下出血<br/><br/>Yesterday, I was informed that my customer, who is a dentist, had been hospitalized with subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured intracranial aneurysms.<br/>昨日、私の顧客である歯医者の先生が、脳動脈瘤破裂によるくも膜下出血で入院していたことを知りました。<br/><br/>The subarachnoid hemorrhage refers to the state in which the blood was mixed in the cerebrospinal fluid, caused by bleeding in a subarachnoid space in a brain.<br/>くも膜下出血とは、脳内のくも膜下腔に出血が生じ、脳髄液中に血液が混入した状態を指します。<br/><br/>This is a horrible disease, it is said that about one-third will die at the same time as the bleeding, and only one-third can return to society.<br/>これは恐ろしい病気で、約1/3は出血と同時に死んでしまい、社会復帰できるのもまた約1/3だと言われています。<br/><br/>I was really relieved, because the dentist got back into society a few days ago.<br/>その先生は、最近社会復帰できたようで、本当に安心しました。

Salt Content in a Ramen<br/>ラーメンの塩分<br/><br/>Today, I went to a ramen shop to eat Szechuan spicy noodles with my friends.<br/>今日は友人と、ラーメン屋に担々麺を食べに行きました。<br/><br/>The ramens, especially the Szechuan spicy noodles have a high salt content, and it's not good for our health.<br/>ラーメン、特に担々麺は塩分含有量が高く、あまり健康には良くありません。<br/><br/>In fact, the salt content of the Szechuan spicy noodles is about 6.3 grams.<br/>実際、担々麺の塩分含有量は約 6.3 g です。<br/><br/>According to the WHO, it is recommended that people limit their salt intake no more than 5 grams per day.<br/>WHOでは一日の塩分摂取量が 5 g 以下になることを推奨しています。<br/><br/>Also, the US government recommends that Americans limit their salt intake no more than about 6 grams per day to prevent a cardiovascular disease.<br/>また、米国では心臓血管病の予防のため、一日の塩分摂取量が約 6 g 以下になるよう呼びかけています。<br/><br/>That is, if you ate the Szechuan spicy noodles, your health would be exposed to risk.<br/>つまり、担々麺を食べた時点でアウトです。<br/><br/>However, Japanese people get salt average 10 g per day.<br/>しかし、日本人は一日に平均 10 g の塩分を摂取しています。<br/><br/>Therefore, most Japanese people have the problem of high-blood pressure.<br/>このため、日本人は高血圧の人が非常に多いです。<br/><br/>I'd like to be careful not to become HBP.<br/>私も高血圧にならないよう気を付けたいです。

I bought a kindle paperwhite because it was sold at 3000 yen off for people who are members of Amazon Student.<br/><br/>Recently, I think I became a person who spend money lavishly.<br/><br/>Maybe because I can't progress my paper on wheels, I am losing my marbles.<br/><br/>Today, I learned that the phrase "lose one's marbles," which means like "go out of one's mind," is derived from the phrase "let his marbles go with the monkey."

Recently, I often perform presentations using the software "Keynote."<br/><br/>I bring only iPhone 5 to a conference room, and perform a presentation by connecting the iPhone to a projector.<br/><br/>It's very easy to prepare, but when I was creating a presentation for next week, a problem was found.<br/><br/>When I have played a heavy movie file on the iPhone 5, the movement of the phone became very slow.<br/><br/>In order to solve this problem, I decided to buy an iPhone 6.<br/><br/>By using the iPhone 6, the slow phenomenon got really better.<br/><br/>From now, I will connect the iPhone 6 to a projector, and will use the iPhone 5 as a remote controller of presentation slides.

Today is the beginning day of the new semester in Japan, and new members were joined our laboratory.<br/><br/>Today is also April Fools day that we can say lying, but in around me, there were no people who were lying.<br/><br/>By the way, do you know an April Fool's rule?<br/><br/>There is a rule that we can say lying only in the forenoon in April 1.<br/><br/>It is a lie that is popular in Japan in recent years, haha.<br/><br/>However, this rule is not a complete lie.<br/><br/>I heard this forenoon rule is a general thing in Britain, Australia, and South Africa (Maybe this is true).<br/><br/>In the UK, there is an anniversary of the Restoration called "Oak Apple Day," and there is a traditional custom to wear oak apples up to noon.<br/><br/>It is said that this custom influenced April Fools Day.<br/><br/>For now, we can say lying all day in April Fools day in the US, Russia, France, Japan and many other countries, but in the future, there is a possibility that the forenoon rule become used in general.

Today, we could not access the internet at our university.<br/><br/>The cause was unclear, and we could not use internet almost all day, so it was really inconvenient.<br/><br/>Someone might attack server of our university.<br/><br/>We (this may be applied only to Japanese people) often refer to a person who attack network system et cetera as a hacker, but this is not correct.<br/><br/>Hackers have a deep technical knowledge that is related to computers or network, and they use the knowledge for system improvement or problem solving.<br/><br/>In other words, hackers are good people.<br/><br/>Although hackers also refer to people who look at inside of computers, when accompanied by illegal acts such as unauthorized access, destruction or falsification, they are called crackers.<br/><br/>However, since hackers and crackers are often confusing, we sometimes refer to a benevolent hackers as a white hat hacker, and refer to a cracker as a black hat hacker.<br/><br/>Also, an especially good hacker is called "wizard" or "guru."<br/><br/>I sometimes hack Java, but I'm not villain.

Today, I ate a slice of Baumkuchen that is my junior's souvenir.<br/><br/>Baumkuchen is a cake that originated in Germany, balm means a tree, and kuchen means a cake.<br/><br/>Also, Baumkuchen has two etymologies.<br/><br/>One is that it had been baked while entwining soft doughs and a stick of oak trees.<br/><br/>The other is that a cross-section of this cake looks like tree rings.<br/><br/>Baumkuchen is very famous as a German cake in Japan, and we often use Baumkuchen as a gift of wedding etc.<br/><br/>However, I heard Baumkuchen is not very famous in Germany.<br/><br/>Someday, I'd like to eat Baumkuchen that are sold in  Dusseldorf, Germany.

Today, I bought cactuses as graduation gifts for my juniors in next week's graduation ceremony.<br/><br/>I usually buy bouquet flowers as a graduation gift, but my juniors said like they want succulent plants like cactuses in advance, so I chose pots which several cactuses were planted.<br/><br/>It is easy to grow cactuses, and it will not wither easily.<br/><br/>Cactuses have thorns, but actually, they are leaves of the cactuses.<br/><br/>It is said that by the leaves shaped like thorns, the surface area would reduce, and it would prevent the evaporation of moisture.<br/><br/>In addition, the thorns have a role of cooling their bodies by scattering strong sunlight.<br/><br/>If you pulled out all the thorns,  the surface temperature of the cactus would rise 10 degrees.

<div class="date">Mar 13, 2015 22:43</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned how many times we should knock a door.<br/><br/>In Japan, most people think that we should knock a door 2 times anytime.<br/><br/>Essentially, Japanese rooms had been separated by a sliding door made of paper, so we didn't have a custom of knocking.<br/><br/>For this reason, we don't know what the number of knocking means very much.<br/><br/>I also didn't know that until recently.<br/><br/>Generally in the United States and Europe, knocking 2 times means toilet knock, knocking 3 times means close relationship with a person in the room, knocking 4 times means international standard protocol.<br/><br/>Although knocking 3 times is becoming mainstream in the Japanese business scene, nearly 90% of Japanese people knock 2 times yet.<br/><br/>Therefore, if you knocked 3 or more times in Japan, you might seem to be "cool."<br/><br/>But conversely, there is a possibility that you seem to be annoying to knock a door many times.<br/><br/>By the way, the reason for knocking 4 times is derived from Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 "fate."<br/><br/>I heard the beginning of this song represents that the devil is knocking the fate door.<br/>

　Today is an entrance examination day of all national universities in Japan. Since I couldn't go to my laboratory, I was working at my apartment almost all day. Today, I wrote an annual report of my study in English, however, it was really difficult for me. I wanted to use a lot of conjunctive words such as "therefore", but it is unsuitable for academic texts. So I want to distinguish the word "therefore," "hence" and "thus" well. I read some blogs that explain differences between them, but I haven't understood it yet. Actually, I had commissioned an institution to correct my short English paper last year, and many conjunctive words, especially "thus" and "hence" were modified. In the near future, I will post an article about these conjunctive words for my understanding.

　Yahoo! Japan is conducting a charity event that the company will donate 10 yen per every person who search for "3.11" on Yahoo! search today. The donation will be used for recovery of Tohoku region where was hit by a huge earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crisis. Yahoo! Japan conducted this charity event also last year, and the company had set an upper limit to 5 million yen corresponding to 50 thousand searchers. However, over 250 thousand people had searched for "3.11" in that day, and finally Yahoo! Japan ignored the upper limit, then over 25 million yen was donated. I didn't know this charity event last year, but I participated to it this year. I wonder how many people search for "3.11" on Yahoo! search today.

<div class="date">Mar 10, 2015 22:14</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Today was bulky trash day for our university. Actually, my boss and I describe this day as "treasure day" because we can pick up useful trash which was abandoned by other researchers. This time, I could obtain PC monitor, PC rack, many PC components, many kind of cables, and furniture. I think it's possible to assemble a PC by using only parts that I picked up. I also picked up two projectors, but they were completely broken. Incidentally, my boss picked up a printer that is almost new, and picked up a life-size dolls for research. Anyway, I had a lot of fun today. (As a matter of fact, about 20% of equipments in our laboratory are composed of trash that my boss and I picked up.)

　Today, I and my juniors rearranged our laboratory so that we can accept new faces. We printed out a sketch of our laboratory, and discussed new arrangement. We had had a lots of opinions, for example, "I want to move a desk out of the sun to prevent skin irritation," "I need more space," "I'd like to avoid a desk near the entrance," "I want to use two desks," and "I want to isolated."<br/><br/>Of course, It is not possible to reflect all these demands, but we tried to think that we are as fully satisfied as possible. About 3 hours later, rearrangement was completed. I thought we'd solved almost all of our problems, however -- some juniors expressed their dissatisfaction soon. Some said "Oops, I'm worried about other people's eyes," and some said "Jesus! my space is too narrow."<br/><br/>Haha, it was difficult. However, I think we have to put on our considering caps about our eyes. According to the Northern Europe research, if we are working without partitions, our productivity, motivation, and concentration would decrease, and chances of getting sick would increase. Although there is nothing surprising about this, most Japanese companies don't use partitions in their offices. In order to improve our productivity, we have to create our spaces that we can concentrate. In fact, since there are four PC displays on my desk and they are serving as a surrogate for partitions, I'm comfortable.

　About a year ago, I registered myself as a Android developer to sign up for the Play store. And few months ago, I registered my first app with the Play store. This app was a countermeasure tool for qualification tests that is related to information technology. The target of this app was very niche, however, I created this for myself. Also, since there are almost no advertisement on this app, it's really difficult to earn money. I today visited to the AdMob page which shows advertising revenue after a long interval. Then, I found that I had earned 2 yen by advertisements of my app. That's one small step for many people, one giant leap for me.

　Yesterday, I met my friend from university. He came my university as a recruiter of a company and introduced his company to students. And today, I ate lunch with him, then later we talked about various things each other. It was so fun to talk with a classmate after a long time. This is why almost all my classmates got into companies when we graduated our university, and there is no classmate in my research building. I sometimes feel lonely, however, I also sometime feel as if I were a boss of students since all students in my research building are younger than me. He-he.

　Today, I created a web page that summarizes my previous posts. Actually, I had created a similar web page, but it was inconvenient because I used accordion representation. The accordion representation means that posts are folded and it would be open when we click the post title. This movement was rather cool, but I couldn't read my post unless I click it. I wanted to search corrected posts using some keywords, and to do this, there's a need all post are opened. So I created new one which is simple, light and open. Now I can search my posts effectively. Hehehe I'm so tired to create this. In the near future, I will re-create the css file and re-design this page.<br/><br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/lang8/" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/lang8/</a>

<div class="date">Mar 5, 2015 20:52</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Today, I learned that there are a lot of "therefore" in sentences which Japanese wrote and it should not be in heavy usage. Also I learned that we must not use "therefore" with comma at the beginning of sentences. Hehehe, I have made great use of the word ever. Similarly, I think we use far too many connective words such as "so, however, as a result."  If we write sentences using many connective words, the sentences would give us the illusion that it's logical despite non-logical. This is really dangerous. In some English-speaking school, students train to enhance their mental capacity and prevent a logical leap by limiting the use of  "so."  I also want to be able to write logical sentences heartily, so I'd like to be careful to avoid "so."  Oops, it's very difficult.

　Today, I went to a ramen shop with my juniors. Surprisingly, foie gras bowl was sold at the ramen shop. The shop offers only 5 little foie gras bowls per day, and 4 bowls were already sold at that time. Therefore, I ordered the foie gras bowl and ate foie gras for the first time in forever. The name of the menu was "foie gras bowl," but in fact, there were only one small slice of foie gras and some slices of beef on a rice bowl. The foie gras is maybe very delicious, but it's difficult for me to describe the taste. I thought cheap meats are more suit me than expensive meats because I want to eat a lot of meat.

　Early in the morning, a massive power outage was occurred in my prefecture. This power outage cut electricity to about 380 thousand homes and stopped about 2700 traffic lights. Furthermore, 15 bullet trains stopped and this influenced about 6600 people. It was reported that the reason of the power outage was that transmission lines had been damaged, and it lasted from 5:30 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. However, actually I couldn't be aware of this power outage, because I woke up around 8:30 a.m. and I didn't use electricity for a while. I just noticed the power outage when I went to my university and watched my PC. Although I put my PC in sleep mode, it was shut down.<br/><br/>　Anyway, this accident was lucky it wasn't worse. I mean, despite the massive power outage, there were no large-scale traffic accidents or injuries.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Today, it was raining, later snowing, and I had a headache almost all day. When it rains, I usually get a headache. It is thought that one of the most important factors of migraine is the change of the weather. When the updraft occurs, the weather becomes bad, and the atmosphere pressure drops. By the atmosphere pressure is dropping sharply, the pressure that is holding the blood vessels in the brain also drops, then the blood vessels are more likely to spread. By the blood vessels in the brain is spread, the nerves surrounding the blood vessels will stimulated and as a result, migraine will be induced. This is one of the hypotheses, but according to my experience, it's true.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Today, I cooked curry again and had a big mistake. In a typical recipe, we will simmer curry for about 20 minutes, but I simmered curry too much. I was going to watch Dr. House during simmering curry, resulting, I infatuated with the drama and forgot my cooking. Curry got burnt and my pot became charred. I barely could eat curry near on the top of the pot, but unfortunately, I left the other portion. Although I washed the pot by scraping strongly, I couldn't take off the burnt deposit which stacks to the bottom of the pot. I was really sad because the pot was my birthday present.

　Today, a birthday party was held in our laboratory. We laboratory member are sometimes hold birthday parties when some members' birthdays are approaching. This time, we celebrated birthdays of two members. We cooked grilled beefs and ate them heartily. After we finished eating the meats, we brought a birthday cake and began to eat again. Then, we sent birthday presents to laboratory members whose birthday is approaching. Since one of them likes cherry blossom, we sent shampoo and rinse and lip balm which have good aroma of cherry to him. Also, since the other will graduate soon and begin a new life, we sent a valuable ballpoint pen to him. We had an ace time at the birthday party.<br/>

　When I was watching an American drama, I was noticed that I could understand some phrases or words without Japanese subtitles. <br/><br/>For example, "you're insane" and "creepy" in "The Big Bang Theory," "you're an idiot" and "you idiot" in "Dr. House," "damn it" and "put your hands on your head" in "24."<br/><br/>I might have a dirty mouse if I keep watching these dramas repeatedly.<br/><br/>However, it is interesting for me to know various characters' trademark phrases.

　Yesterday, I cooked hot curry for my dinner. Since I used an expensive Japanese Black Wagyu, it became delicious. However, I cooked the curry too much (I made 6 servings), so today's my breakfast and lunch and dinner were also the curry. I think a few percent of now my body is composed of the curry. I'm worried whether my body is giving off a curry smell.

　Today, the graduation research poster presentation of bachelors was held. There were many interesting studies, and I was satisfied to hear various stories. Also, some studies were focused on SNS like twitter or line. Although these studies were still immature, it was very fascinating. I heard a foreign study result implies that trends of tweets and diseases are correlated. I mean, people who tweet negative words are prone to get diseases. That is to say, by analyzing big data like tweets in twitter, an early detection of diseases will might be possible. <br/>

<div class="date">Feb 16, 2015 23:43</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Today, I learned the origin of the symbol '$' called dollar or pesos. One of the most widely prevalent hypotheses is derived from pesos. That is, it is thought '$' is the combination of P and S from pesos. Also, in the 16th Century, 1 peso is equivalent to 8 Real. Therefore, it is also thought '$' is the combination of 8 and R from pesos. Furthermore, other hypotheses is shown as follows:<br/><br/>･ It was derived from HS of sestertius which is Roman currency.<br/>･ It was derived from S which is Shilling currency symbol.<br/>･ It was derived from US which represents unit of silver (or United States).<br/>･ It was derived from the figure that ribbons are winding around Pillars of Hercules which is a symbol of Spain.<br/><br/>[Extra information (This is just my brief note)]<br/>　It is thought that the symbol '@' called at-sign was derived from "ad" in Latin which means "at" in English. But many other hypotheses exist.<br/>　The symbol '&amp;' called ampersand was derived from "et" in Latin which means "and" in English. That is because "etc." (et cetra = and so forth) is sometimes abbreviated like "&amp;c."

　　Today, I cooked a nabe dishes. A nabe means a pot, and also means a Japanese cuisine similar to stew. This dish is really simple to cook, because all we have to do is putting various foods in a pot and boiling them. Today, I put Chinese cabbage, Welsh onion, bean curd, velvet shank, chicken and pork in an earthen pot and boiled them using a chicken based soup. It was really simple taste and delicious, also it made me warmed. Furthermore, it is good for health. In Japanese winter, we can't spend comfortably without nabe dishes.

I searched an English phrase which means "ゲロを吐く (puke or vomit)," as a result, some phrases like as follows were founded:<br/><br/>"bark at ants"<br/>"feed the fish"<br/>"sing to the sink"<br/>"woof one's cookies"<br/><br/>I didn't know why these phrases mean "puke," so I thought the reason.<br/><br/>"bark at ants"<br/>Since ants are worming on the ground, the puking pose looks like barking at ants. Maybe that's why.<br/><br/>"feed the fish"<br/>I thought this phrase liken vomited foods to fish food.<br/><br/>"sing to the sink"<br/>A scene that a human is puking to the sink is as if who are singing to the sink. Maybe.<br/><br/>"woof one's cookies"<br/>The word woof is similar to the word puke, but I didn't know why cookies. This phrase might liken vomited foods to cookies.<br/><br/> I'm so sorry for posting a dirty content.<br/><br/>Also, according to the following webpage, there were so many puke words. I gave up to think where all of these words come from.<br/><a href="http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/puke-words/" target="_blank">http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/puke-words/</a>

<div class="date">Feb 13, 2015 22:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned some English phrases used by programmers, and I think they were interesting. So I'd like to introduce some of them.<br/><br/>"I'm teenager in hex." or "I'm 20's in hex."<br/>10 to 1F in hex means 16 to 31 in decimal, and 20 to 2F in hex means 32 to 47 in decimal. So I can say "I'm teenager in hex," hehe. If you say your age in hex, it's possible to pretend as if you're young.<br/><br/>"I took a core dump."<br/>This means I drank too much or I puked. Core dump is an original memory file and it is spat up when a fatal error occurs. Anyway, this phrase This phrase represent like I'm really out of shape.<br/><br/>"She is Haskell."<br/>This means she is really pure, but it's difficult to approach.<br/><br/>"He created a Lisp implementation in PostScript."<br/>This means he is a freak.<br/>

<div class="date">Feb 12, 2015 23:26</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　I heard that one of the most difficult English phrases for Japanese to understand is "one of the most <em>adjective</em> + <em>plural</em>." I think this is true because I also confused this phrase. We learn that "the most" means "もっとも(mottomo)," and that the intended thing by "mottomo" should be only one. That is, "mottomo" is including the meaning of "only one." However, the words "one of + 'plural'" is attached to "the most." In view of Japanese, this is inconsistent because "one of" intends multiple things while "the most" intends only one thing. For example, when we read the sentence like "One of the highest mountains is...", we might wonder the highest mountain is not only one. Therefore, we learn something like "the most" intends things which belong to a superior group in this case. I was already accustomed to the phrase, but some Japanese are not persuaded because the Japanese words corresponding to "one of the most" is unnatural.<br/><br/>　Also, I heard a professor in a US university said that we should use "one of the more" instead of "one of the most." I don't know whether this point is correct or not, but I think it's interesting.

Today, we held the sixth anniversary of my grandfather's death (and sixteenth anniversary of my grandmother's death).<br/><br/>Many relatives came to my home, and we chanted a Buddhist sutra.<br/><br/>While we are chanting a Buddhist chant, we usually kneel on our knees on a cushion.<br/><br/>However, I have a little bit of trouble with this posture, and as expected, my legs go to sleep.<br/><br/>I couldn't stand up for a while, but anyway, this event passed in peace.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, actually my mother is a Christian while my father is a Buddhist.<br/><br/>So sometimes I have no idea who I am.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I bought a ergonomic keyboard designed by Microsoft because Amazon had had a time sale. The keys of this keyboard is divided into right and left, and the center is swelling. This curved keyboard layout is based on ergonomics in order to let us rest our hand and wrist, and let us reach keys easily. However, it is difficult for me to type letters using this keyboard for now. That is because I usually type <em>B</em> by my right hand while <em>B</em> key is left side on this keyboard. As a result of measuring my typing using this keyboard, mistyped rate increased 30% and typing speed decreased 40%. I need many practice to master it.

　Today, my boss and I checked master thesis presentations of my two juniors. Each presentation was 15 minutes, however, our comments and discussion took around 3 hours. Although we all got exhausted, my juniors had to make a thorough review of the points put forth by us after that. I want them to be rewarded eventually because they have been working hard.

<div class="date">Feb 6, 2015 23:12</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Today, I went to a valedictory lecture of my boss' boss. The boss, who is a professor of my university, finally reached the retirement age of 65. In the past few years, I had attended classes of the professor several times. When I realized that this is the really last lecture of him, I felt real grief.<br/><br/>　The lecture was about the professor's researches and history. He told us his researches as if he were children. It was very impressive. He also said something like "It's doubtful that I am adult." Perhaps he's right, because he looked very young while he was talking.<br/><br/>　During the lecture, he gave us an advice for developing our originality as machinery researchers. He referred to the way as 4H; Horizontal, Hard, Humor, Humanity. That is, we need horizontal thinking that is not biased, opportunity to touch hard stuff, humor for enjoying our research, humanity to pursue happiness.<br/><br/>　At the end of the lecture, he introduced a poem "A Psalm of Life" written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. He said he especially was impressed the following passage;<br/><br/>In the world’s broad field of battle,<br/>   In the bivouac of Life,<br/>Be not like dumb, driven cattle!<br/>   Be a hero in the strife!<br/><br/>His lecture brought a lump to my throat. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to him.

Today, I found some interesting English sites, for example, The Oatmeal, FML, Engrish.com, and so on.<br/><br/>The Oatmeal is a comic website created by Matthew Inman. All comics on this site were drawn by him, and a huge variety of comics are published. These comics look like really interesting, but unfortunately, I couldn't understand almost all these comic jokes without dictionaries. I think If I can read these comics smoothly, they will become more interesting.<br/><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/" target="_blank">http://theoatmeal.com/</a><br/><br/>On the other hand, I could understand some jokes of FML without dictionaries. Every day, many people post interesting events that happened to them as their diary on FML. Almost all posts are really short and simple. <br/><a href="http://www.fmylife.com/" target="_blank">http://www.fmylife.com/</a><br/><br/>I think I can take a breathing spell and learn English by reading these sites' jokes. I will sometimes try to read these jokes for my relief and studying.

<div class="date">Feb 1, 2015 23:05</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　In Japan, the graduation season is approaching. As is often the case, graduate research presentations are held in Mid-February, the deadline for graduation thesis is February as well.<br/>　Today, I read and corrected my junior's master theses carefully almost all day. It stands to reason that every sentence he wrote is perfect, but the connections of sentences were sometimes unnatural. Also, his story was sometimes logically incoherent. I was patiently looking for his mistakes and wrote correction comments. I was a little tired, but I'm happy to feel my junior's growth.

<div class="date">Jan 31, 2015 23:32</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　I often solve some problems in the intervals between my study. Today, I chose a problem with Pascal's triangle from Project Euler. Pascal's triangle is a triangle that is created by the simple rules, such as following:<br/><br/>    1<br/>   1 1<br/>  1 2 1<br/> 1 3 3 1<br/>1 4 6 4 1<br/><br/>　And the problem demanded the number of entries which are not divisible by 7 in the first one billion rows of Pascal's triangle. The number of elements that I have to check is about 500 quadrillion (5 times 10 to the 17th power).<br/><br/>　I wrote a simple program code which calculates Pascal's triangle made of residue of 7 (modularized by 7?). However, this program took about 30 seconds to check 5 billion elements in my computer. This means it will take 95 years to solve this problem. I think there is a smart analytical solution because there are too many elements to solve using dynamic programming. I couldn't solve this problem today, but I like such a problem that remind me of the splendor of algorithms.

　2 days ago, I watched gameplay video of "FEZ," which was developed by Polytron Corporation in Canada. I felt the concept of the game is really interesting. In the game, characters are living in a 2D world, but actually, the world is 3D. One day, a central character, Gomez got a power interfering the three-dimensional space, and decided to save the world using the power.<br/><br/>　According to the play movie, there are many funny gimmick composed of 2D and 3D. I really like such a mystery solving game. So I decided to purchase on Steam, even though I wouldn't play the game for a while. Then, I created a Steam account and just purchase it at 980 yen. However, when I watched the Steam site today, I noticed "FEZ" is sold at 75% OFF. It's only 245 yen. I became a little sad.

   In Japan, there is a word <em>Ameotoko,</em> which means a man whose presence bring on rain in events such as a travel. The word is often used as a joke, but I think it might denigrate someone. In my considered opinion, raining on a trip is not rare case at least in Japan. Actually, the number of precipitation days is 123 days a year in Japan, it's almost one-third probability. There is no wonder that it rains during travels for several times in a row. <br/><br/>   However, if it rains for 15 consecutive times, the probability becomes less than being hit with a thunderbolt probability (or the lottery winning probability). Also, if it rains for 20 consecutive times, the probability becomes as probable as being hit by a meteorite. If there is such a person, he should be respected, I think.<br/>

(katatsumuri means snail.)<br/><br/>Every winter, the lazy people were mass-produced by kotatsu, so I want to deal it very carefully.<br/><br/>Ahhh, I must be in heaven...<br/><br/>By the way, the man whose car was bumped by my one contacted me.<br/><br/>As repair costs, He requested ten thousand yen (almost 85 dollars) to me.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the repair place was his car's license plate only.<br/><br/>I'm grateful for surviving.

<div class="date">Jan 23, 2015 22:13</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned laws of how to pronounce abbreviations.<br/><br/>Firstly, if the abbreviation is composed of 2 characters, it should be pronounced in unabbreviated form.<br/><br/>For example, "i.e." is pronounced "that is," and "e.g." is pronounced "for example."<br/><br/>Secondly, if the abbreviation is composed of 3 characters, it should be pronounced each characters.<br/><br/>For example, "WHO," "TPP," "ODA," and "FBI."<br/><br/>Thirdly, if the abbreviation is composed of 4 or more characters, it should be pronounced literally.<br/><br/>For example, "NATO," "AIDS," "NASA," and "UNESCO."<br/><br/>However, there are many exceptions.<br/><br/>For example, "UCLA" is pronounced "yuu-see-el-ei," "MIT" is sometimes pronounced "mit."<br/><br/>I think the way of pronounce depends on its readability, understandability, and degree of coolness.

I watched a few episodes of "White Color" on Hulu.<br/><br/>It was interesting, so I'll continue to watch it.<br/><br/>However, I noticed that the drama will have the plug pulled in season 6.<br/><br/>I think American dramas are really interesting, but I also think they are too long.<br/><br/>Please don't extend story just because it became a popular, please don't become strange final episode.<br/><br/>I don't know what will happen in future episodes of "White Color", I desperately think so.

I've done my statistics homework since fer hours.<br/><br/>It's about t test, and I have to make some sort of null hypothesis which would be rejected.<br/><br/>So now, I'm collecting X-ray CT simulation data as changing parameters of incident X-ray intensity distribution.<br/><br/>I thought there is a significant difference between standard deviation of incident X-ray intensity and quality of reconstruction images (CT images).<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to get results.<br/><br/>It's thrilling. :)

Today, I finished creating an X-ray CT simulation software for my client of the dentist, and delivered it.<br/><br/>It took me about 3 weeks.<br/><br/>Because I had to create it alone, it was really hard to debug it.<br/><br/>However, in spite of my exertions, some bugs might remained.<br/><br/>I think the client will report some bugs or request additional function to me within a week, and I will reply to his request.<br/><br/>The software development process is(maybe) referred to as the spiral model which was proposed by Barry Boehm in 1988.<br/><br/>Actually, I just wanted to use the words "spiral model" because I felt the sound was cool.<br/><br/>And after that, I've learned English words patiently.

This morning, I tried to sneak into a class of master's course, and was exposed immediately because there were few students.<br/><br/>However, the teacher welcomed me with good cheer. Yes!<br/><br/>The teacher teach statistics using Python, and I wanted to learn how to use Python for statistics analysis.<br/><br/>In the class, the teacher spoke only English, so sometimes I could not understand his words.<br/><br/>However, I could get a sense of Python programming, and it was so exciting.<br/><br/>And now, I have a homework until next week.<br/><br/>Homework...it's been a really long time.<br/><br/>I'm excited!

Two months ago, I forgot to prepare my mother's birthday present.<br/><br/>And after one month from now, I will go back to my hometown for some reason.<br/><br/>Since I want to give my mother a present at that time, I bought a SSD today.<br/><br/>Of course, my mother doesn't want such a SSD, but she previously said "I wish I could have had my laptop.."<br/><br/>Therefore, I decided to compose a laptop using my old PC components and the SSD.<br/><br/>I'm sure she likes this laptop! :D

<div class="date">Jan 13, 2015 23:00</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I considered whether or not to break away from Swing-based development.<br/><br/>Swing is a famous GUI widget toolkit for Java language.<br/><br/>Actually, I've used Swing to develop software for 5 years, and we've gone together like bacon and eggs, and I love her.<br/><br/>But development resources for Swing decreased significantly, and Oracle said "JavaFX will supersede Swing.".<br/><br/>So I learned JavaFX a little, but there were so many different points between JavaFX and Swing.<br/><br/>I was really sad.<br/><br/>It was not possible for me to determine parting with her today.

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I suddenly remembered my embarrassing event in the last year.<br/><br/>Today, I want to write the bare truth.<br/><br/>I participated the international conference in Singapore, and after it was finished, I went to the airport lounge to go back to Japan.<br/><br/>And I was eating light meal alone at 3 seater table, and one couple came next to my table.<br/><br/>They put their luggage in the chair and trying to sit down, but they're short by one chair.<br/><br/>At that moment, I intuitively thought they would come my table and say something like "Can we use this chair?" to me.<br/><br/>Therefore, I braced myself for saying "Of course!", and then they came.<br/><br/>They said "Is this seat occupied?", and I said "Of course!" with the gesture meaning "Please use this.".<br/><br/>They were confused and I was confused too, and I didn't know what to say.<br/><br/>Since I just finished eating foods then, I gave them a little smile and went off hastily.<br/><br/>I was embarrassed.

Although I rarely get annoyed, I was different today.<br/><br/>A student told me something like "You might be criticized by your boss because you're wasting time in such a trashy programming.".<br/><br/>What?!  I never thought it's a waste of time and never ignored my study!!!!!!<br/><br/>If he were a professional programmer, I might barely understand his remark, but he's a complete beginner.<br/><br/>Furthermore, He spends five days a week not studying at all.<br/><br/>I really didn't want to be said such a thing from such him.<br/><br/>Humph, humph!<br/><br/>I'm so sorry to sing the blues.

Today, I had an one-on-one meeting with a professor of engineering about his paper's figure.<br/><br/>The professor's study is related to the earthquake, and he is planning to insert many figures in his paper.<br/><br/>So, he hired me as an exclusive illustrator.<br/><br/>Wait, why did I say "so"?<br/><br/>I'm a software engineer, but not totally an illustrator.<br/><br/>It didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>But I accepted willingly the project because he said he will buy Adobe Creative Suite 6 for me.<br/><br/>Actually, I really wanted Adobe products, but I couldn't purchase it due to its high price.<br/><br/>So it was a perfect opportunity for me, hehehe.<br/><br/>Okay, I will start learning how to use Illustrator and Photoshop.

I finally finished dictating all dialogues of the "Frozen".<br/><br/>As expected, it took me 2 hours to complete last 20%.<br/><br/>Eventually, it took me 10 hours to dictate the 100 minutes movie.<br/><br/>Namely, I can watch a movie 10 seconds and dictate around 13 words in 1 minute.<br/><br/>The efficiency was not good, but I thought the dictation is very educational.<br/><br/>Also, I'm feeling a sense of intriguing accomplishment for the first time in forever.<br/><br/>I will henceforth continue to dictate English, but  I will probably choose more short story such as TED talks.<br/><br/>(After watching this movie, I began to think I'd like to say "My Lady" someday. )

<div class="date">Jan 4, 2015 23:54</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I watch the movie "Frozen" dictating.<br/><br/>The reason why I chose that title is its serifs might be easy to understand and listen.<br/><br/>After 5 hours when I started, about 3000 words were typed.<br/><br/>The movie progressed just half.<br/><br/>It was more difficult to listen serifs than I thought.<br/><br/>In particular, song parts and Oaken's serifs are difficult for me.<br/><br/>Oaken is a shop owner who speaks with a Scandinavian accent.<br/><br/>Because I was not used to hear it, he's serifs confused me.<br/><br/>Also, interjections are difficult for me to dictate, such as "Whoo", "Yeesh", "Whoa", "Yoo-hoo", etc.<br/><br/>But I never give up, and will keep doing the best that I can.

Finally, I finished creating a dictation software program for improving my English.<br/><br/>At first, I tried to make the software using Java.<br/><br/>However, it was revealed that creating browser-like software using Java (without SWT) is not easy.<br/><br/>So, I began to learn the C# programming language from this morning.<br/><br/>I knew C# can create browser-like software easily and there are many common points between C# and Java.<br/><br/>To learn new programming language is exciting, but frustrating when I couldn't code as intended.<br/><br/>Result of the lengthy fight, the simple dictation software as follows was completed anyway.<br/><br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/dictation.jpg" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/dictation.jpg</a><br/><br/>I'm going to improve my English using this software while improving this software gradually.<br/><br/>And today, the TopCoder contest was canceled (server error occurred) during the round. <br/><br/>I got really sad. <br/><br/>It was heartbreaking, ahh.

Have your made your New Year's resolutions?<br/><br/>This year, I'm going to improve my English in earnest.<br/><br/>So today,  I began to create a software to help my studying.<br/><br/>The only one software specification is to support the dictation of foreign dramas.<br/><br/>Once I prepare the subtitles of foreign dramas, It will become possible to train my hearing ability by typing dictation practice.<br/><br/>The development hasn't finished yet, but it's expected to be completed tomorrow.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to using the software and watching foreign dramas. :)<br/>

Basically, I have no day off.<br/><br/>As always, I went to my university and did my work.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, I just like studying and don't want to get rest, rather than there are no day off.<br/><br/>Some juniors also came our laboratory. <br/><br/>That's because the deadline of their master thesis is approaching.<br/><br/>They look desperate, and maybe I might be like them next year due to my doctoral thesis deadline.<br/><br/>However, the new year's eve of this year, I came home early leaving juniors.<br/><br/>And now, I spend my time slowly while watching TV shows and eating oranges.<br/><br/>Best wishes throughout the coming year.

Today, I read a bool titled "Gupta in Wonderland (Fushigi no kuni no Gupta)".<br/><br/>In this book, Indian named Gupta living in the world of TOEIC test realize various things gradually.<br/><br/>I had took TOEIC tests several times, so when I read the book, I thought "It could happen!!" frequently and I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>For example, in the world of TOEIC, there are many laws as following;<br/><br/>1. A Flight will always delayed definitely.<br/><br/>2. A Photocopier will be broken or paper will run out always.<br/><br/>3. A reservation of dentist will be made change always.<br/><br/>4. Indian names of the world are Gupta or Singh always.<br/><br/>Besides, the other various laws are exist in this world.<br/><br/>I realized the world of TOEIC test is strange certainly.<br/><br/>Since now I know these laws, I think taking a TOEIC test become a little fun.

It was snowing a lot this morning.<br/><br/>After I shoveled the snow that was piled around my car, I was trying to back the car from the parking area.<br/><br/>I couldn't see behind securely due to the snow, and there is a parked car on my car's behind.<br/><br/>"Bump!" The sound made my face pale, and my heart was in my mouth.<br/><br/>The car's license plate and my car's left-side rear were dented.<br/><br/>However, there was nobody in the car and the owner was close by, so we could talk to each other immediately.<br/><br/>(I think these things were a blessing in disguise.)<br/><br/>First, I tried to call the police, but he said "You need not to do that."<br/><br/>As a result of our talking, it was decided only that I will pay a fee for repairing his car.<br/><br/>Definitely, I was relieved because there were no injured, and the car's owner was a good man.<br/><br/>I'll be careful from now on.<br/>

Since a TOEIC test is just a month away, today I practiced solve problems assuming an actual exam.<br/><br/>It took 2 hours to solve the 200 problems, and it took about 3 hours to score them and to understand their commentary, then I was very tired.<br/><br/>My score was 650 points... it's awful.<br/><br/>I have to acquire 730 points at least on the TOEIC test in order to satisfy graduation requirements.<br/><br/>But I think 730 points isn't enough because I have to write doctoral thesis in English next year.<br/><br/>From today, I will try to solve TOEIC problems every day.<br/><br/>And today, after I finished the practice, I played "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword" that I bought six months ago.<br/><br/>It's really funny, so I'm afraid I can't stop playing it.<br/><br/>However, I decided the game play up to maximum an hour a day.

Today, I bought an Xperia Z3 which is a smartphone made by Sony in an electronics store.<br/><br/>I could purchase it at 0 yen because I used MNP(Mobile Number Portability system) and then discount campaign of MNP was applied.<br/><br/>However, since the monthly fee is 1,000 yen during 2 years, so practically I bought it 24,000 yen.<br/><br/>It was a little bit late, but as a christmas present, I gave the Xperia Z3 for myself.<br/><br/>Hehehe.

<div class="date">Dec 26, 2014 23:14</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I wrote new year's greeting cards.<br/><br/>In Japan, there are twelve types of zodiac(animal symbol) for each year, and we often draw the animal in the new year's card.<br/><br/>The zodiac of next year is sheep, but I thought it's boring to draw sheep merely.<br/><br/>So, I searched sheep in the mandelbrot set which is represented as follows: <br/><br/>z_n=(z_n)^2+C,<br/><br/>where C is a complex number, and interestingly, this complex sequence represents fractal(fractal means the shape has many various self-similar patterns).<br/><br/>And after a while, I found sheep-likes shape in the square of the diameter 4.57321575822222e-8 which was centered at the coordinate (-1.74972831529409, -3.35584316649456e-10) .<br/><br/>[ Colorful image ]<br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/mandel0.jpg" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/mandel0.jpg</a><br/><br/>[ Tone curve corrected image ]<br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/mandel.jpg" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/mandel.jpg</a><br/><br/>I decided to use the sheep hidden in the mandelbrot set, and then, I drew sheep's eyes additionally and printed it.<br/><br/>[ Result of trimming and rotating and adding an eye. ]<br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/sheep.jpg" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/sheep.jpg</a><br/><br/>Beautiful sheep shaped mathematical was completed!<br/>

Today, we performed a large cleaning of the end of the year.<br/><br/>I was so tired because we cleaned every nook and corner.<br/><br/>However, our room became clean and its environment is really comfortable. <br/><br/>After that, we held a year end party again.<br/><br/>It's the fourth time we had held the party this year.<br/><br/>We ate a hot pot cooking while watching a movie of Doraemon.<br/>（Draemon is a Japanese animation character famous in Japan.）<br/><br/>When I watched the Draemon animation, I relived my childhood and sentimentalized.<br/><br/>Ah, I'm already an adult ....

<div class="date">Dec 24, 2014 23:16</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
This year, I have nothing to do with Xmas.<br/><br/>I went to school, researched, worked, came back to home and participated a programming contest.<br/>And misery as well, I was crushing defeat in the contest.<br/><br/>The first problem of the contest demanded the result of A+B.<br/>It looks like really simple and easy, however, it was forbidden to use addition/subtraction operator, and we could use multiplication/division operator and "if" sentence only (comparison operators are not included).<br/>Furthermore, the code was limited to 1000 lines and the number of available variables was limited to 26. <br/><br/>I tried to solve this problem, and about 4 hour later, the contest finished while the problem is not solved.<br/>(Accordingly, just one participant could solve it completely.)<br/><br/>Finally, the answer will be published, but I don't see it and keep trying to solve it by myself for a while.<br/>Because I want to taste the sense of accomplishment and bliss.<br/><br/>Hehehe!
