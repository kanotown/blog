# I bought a kindle paperwhite
<div class="date">Apr 6, 2015 22:49</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I bought a kindle paperwhite because it was sold at 3000 yen off for people who are members of Amazon Student.<br/><br/>Recently, I think I became a person who spend money lavishly.<br/><br/>Maybe because I can't progress my paper on wheels, I am losing my marbles.<br/><br/>Today, I learned that the phrase "lose one's marbles," which means like "go out of one's mind," is derived from the phrase "let his marbles go with the monkey."

Amazon Studentの会員向けに3000円オフのセールをやっていたので、kindle paperwhite を買いました。<br/><br/>最近、お金遣いが荒くなった気がします。<br/><br/>論文がなかなか進まなくて、頭が少しおかしくなってきたのかもしれません。<br/><br/>頭がおかしくなるという表現の "lose one's marbles" は、猿にビー玉をとられる、という表現から来ているそうです。
