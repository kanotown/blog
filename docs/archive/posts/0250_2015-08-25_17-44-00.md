# 【No. 0250】Bulky Trash Day
<div class="date">Aug 25, 2015 17:44</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today was bulky trash day for our university, and I enjoyed it because we could get the trash.<br/><br/>There were many nice bulky trash in the dumping ground, for example, Power Mac G4, G5, laptops of ASUS, and PCs of Dell.<br/><br/>Eventually, I got about ten PCs.<br/><br/>All the PCs were very old ones, but I like to fiddle around with old PCs, so I'm happy.<br/><br/>Also, my boss got a vacuum cleaner of Dyson.<br/><br/>He looks so happy.

今日は大学の粗大ごみの日で、捨てられたものは貰うことができるため、楽しかったです。<br/><br/>ゴミ捨て場には、Power Mac の G4 や G5、ASUS のノートパソコンや DELL のパソコンなど、素敵なものが沢山捨てられていました。<br/><br/>最終的に、私は10台程のパソコンを手に入れました。<br/><br/>全て古いパソコンですが、私は古いパソコンを触るのが好きなので、幸せです。<br/><br/>また、私の先生はダイソンの掃除機を手に入れていました。<br/><br/>とても嬉しそうでした。

Thank you very much for correcting me! :)<br/>It's not comfortable to use old electronics, but we can learn a lot from them! So I love them.
