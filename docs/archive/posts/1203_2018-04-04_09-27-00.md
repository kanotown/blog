日本の幼稚園児<br/><br/>今日は仕事のため、久しぶりに満員電車に乗りました。<br/><br/>相変わらずの混み具合で、ものすごく疲れました。<br/><br/>そんな中、電車の中に4〜5歳位の幼稚園の制服を着た女の子が立っていることに気が付きました。<br/><br/>すぐ後ろにはスーツの女性が立っていたので、親子なのかなと思いましたが、違いました。<br/><br/>ある駅に到着すると、その女の子は走って電車を降り、改札に向かっていったのです。<br/><br/>すなわちこの子は、幼稚園児であるにも関わらず、一人で電車通園しているということです。<br/><br/>いくら治安が良いと言っても、私は娘にはそのようなことはさせたくありません（独身ですが）。

 I've lost track of how many times I've seen children 5 years old commuting in Tokyo.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sometimes in pairs, but other times alone.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At the beginning I found it impressive, but then I just got used to it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile in the USA, if a 10 year old is playing across the street from his home, the neighbours call the cops.

Thank you for your comment. :)<br/><br/>Since I haven't seen such children in the area where I'm living, I was surprised, but that is not a special thing, isn't it? I'm a little scared. Also, the difference between countries is interesting as always.
