"Pocari Sweat" is one of the most popular sport drink in Japan.<br/><br/>Many of us drink it during sport, and it is sold in most of the shops and vending machines.<br/><br/>I think it's something like "Gatorade" in foreign countries, but it has also a little sour taste in addition to sweet tastes.<br/><br/>However, the sour taste never imply that Pocari's sweat is contained.<br/><br/>"Sweat" in "Pocari Sweat" means that the drink can replenish water lost by sweating.<br/><br/>Also, I heard that "Pocari" has no meaning.<br/><br/>I really like this drink "Pocari Sweat," but I think that it will be shunned by the name in English-speaking countries.

「ポカリスウェット」は、日本で有名なスポーツドリンクです。<br/><br/>我々の多くはスポーツ中にそれを飲み、またそれはほとんどの店や自動販売機で売られています。<br/><br/>海外で言うところの「ゲータレード」のようなものだと思いますが、甘味の他に少し酸味もあります。<br/><br/>けど、決してポカリの汗が入っているわけではありません。<br/><br/>「スウェット」は、発汗によって失われた水分を効率的に補給する飲み物という意味のようです。<br/><br/>「ポカリ」に意味は無いそうです。<br/><br/>私はポカリスウェットがとても好きなのですが、海外では名前で敬遠されると思います。

 I heard non-Japanese are curious about Calpis because it sounds like "Cow Piss" lol

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>I never thought Calpis sounds like that, haha. Thank you for letting me know. :)<br/><br/>海外では Calpico という名前なんですね。知らずに見たら偽物だと思っていたかもしれません。笑

You're welcome. Recently, I watched the TV show called "You は何しに日本へ".<br/><br/>The interviewer talked three British men at the airport. He asked them what they wanted to do the first. They said they want to try Calpis. I guessed they'd been curious about the taste.
