# <strong><em>Tarafuku</strong></em> (たらふく - Having Enough)
<div class="date">Sep 6, 2017 12:52</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
These days, since I eat meals until I become a state called "tarafuku" (たらふく), I am getting a little bit fat.<br/><br/>"Tarafuku" is a word that represents a state that you can't eat any more due to a feeling of fullness, or an act of eating or drinking a lot.<br/><br/>"Tarafuku" is written as "鱈腹" in Kanji, where the "鱈" (tara) means "cod/codfish," and the "腹" (fuku) means "stomach."<br/><br/>In fact, the stomach of cod is swollen, but this kanji is a kind of phonetic equivalents, and the etymology of "tarafuku" isn't related to cod.<br/><br/>The actual etymology is more simple -- the adverbial suffix "ku" (く) has been added to the verb "tarafu" (足らふ), which means that something is enough.<br/><br/>In Japan, it's generally said that eating moderately is better than eating until "tarafuku."

たらふく<br/><br/>私は最近、「たらふく」になるまでご飯を食べるせいで、少し太ってきました。<br/><br/>「たらふく」とは、満腹でもうこれ以上食べられないことや、たくさん飲み食いすることを表す言葉です。<br/><br/>「たらふく」は漢字で「鱈腹」と書き、確かに鱈のお腹は膨れていますが、これは当て字であり、語源ではありません。<br/><br/>実際の「たらふく」の語源は、十分であることを意味する動詞「足らふ」に、副詞語尾の「く」がついたものと考えられています。<br/><br/>日本では一般的に、たらふく食べるよりも、腹八分目のほうが良いとされています。
