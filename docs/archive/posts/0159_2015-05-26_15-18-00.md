# Compatibility Between Browsers
<div class="date">May 26, 2015 15:18</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A few days ago, I built a web page and released it.<br/><br/>I was feeling relieved, but then, I got a message from a customer.<br/><br/>"My associate can't browse this page well. He use Internet Explorer 8."<br/><br/>I created the page using CSS3 and JavaScript, but the IE8 couldn't deal with them.<br/><br/>I immediately started to modify the page.<br/><br/>The next thing I knew, it had become morning.

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>I also wonder it, but sadly, I heard many governments and organizations in Japan are using old IE yet.

 Here in Australia, we had to make things compatible for IE6 not too long ago :(.

Thank you very much for correcting my post!<br/>Oh, it sounds scary. I hope someday every web programmer is freed from a spell of compatibility.
