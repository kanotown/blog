<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Tsutsu Uraura</strong></em> (津津浦浦 - All Over the Country)</h1>
<div class="date">Feb 5, 2019 15:49</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Tsutsu Uraura</strong></em><br/><br/>To describe "all over the country" or "throughout the land," you can use the four-character idiom <strong><em>tsutsu uraura</em></strong> (津津浦浦).<br/><br/><strong><em>Tsu</em></strong> (津) means a dock or a harbor, and <strong><em>ura</em></strong> (浦) means a cove or a coast, so the literal meaning of this idiom is "harbors and coasts."<br/><br/>Japan is an island country and is surrounded by the sea.<br/><br/>Because of this, marine traffic using ships in Japan has been developed for a long time ago, and there are many docks throughout this country.<br/><br/>The idiom <em>tsutsu uraura</em> was borne from this fact.<br/><br/>You can also write it as 津々浦々 by using 々, which means repetition.

津津浦浦<br/><br/>全国のいたるところや、全国のすみずみを意味する四字熟語に、「津津浦浦」があります。<br/><br/>「津」は船着場や港、「浦」は入江や海岸のことを意味します。<br/><br/>島国である日本は、海に囲まれています。<br/><br/>このため、日本では古くから船を用いた海上交通が発展し、全国のいたるところに船着場があります。<br/><br/>この事実から、「津津浦浦」は上述の意味を持つようになったというわけです。<br/><br/>繰り返しを意味する「々」を用いて、「津々浦々」と書くこともできます。

To describe <span class="f_gray">the concept of</span> "all over the country" or "throughout the land," you can use the four-character idiom 'tsutsu uraura' (津津浦浦).
<p class="correction_comment">This is just an optional suggestion. I think adding the word "concept" tells the listener that you are about to describe an idea and give it a definition.</p>

Because of this, <span class="sline"><span class="f_gray">marine traffic using ships</span></span> <span class="f_blue">naval technology</span> in Japan has been developed for a long time <span class="sline"><span class="f_red">ago</span></span>, and there are many docks throughout this country.
<p class="correction_comment">"For a long time ago" doesn't really make sense. I think you are trying to combine two expressions.<br/><br/>"For a long time."<br/>"A long time ago."<br/><br/>"Marine traffic using ships" is okay to use but is a little redundant. This is kind of like saying "road traffic using cars." I suggest saying "naval technology."<br/><br/>Another way to say this would be "...naval technology in Japan has long been developed, and there are many docks throughout this country."</p>

You can also write it as 津々浦々 by using 々, which means repetition.
<p class="correction_comment">Another suggestion:<br/>"...by using 々, which means to repeat the previous character."</p>

<p class="comment_small">
 You write very well! My suggestions today are not to fix mistakes. They are only ideas that I think sound a little nicer.
