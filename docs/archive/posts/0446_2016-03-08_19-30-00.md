<h1 id="subject_show">A Terrible Failure</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Mar 8, 2016 19:30</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today's my plan was to ride a bus at 5:40 AM and to go to Tokyo from Nagano.<br/><br/>However, I woke up at 5:39 AM.<br/><br/>I turned white as a sheet.<br/><br/>I definitely miss the bus.<br/><br/>The bus reservation ticket went to waste.<br/><br/>Furthermore, since I had to arrive at Tokyo by noon, it was necessary to use a bullet train, which requires more than three times the fare of the bus.<br/><br/>It was a stab in my wallet.<br/><br/>I'll be careful hereafter.

ひどい失敗<br/><br/>今日は朝5時半のバスに乗り、長野から東京に行く予定でした。<br/><br/>しかし、朝5時半に目が覚めました。<br/><br/>血の気が引きました。<br/><br/>絶対に間に合いません。<br/><br/>バスの予約料金が、完全に無駄になってしまいました。<br/><br/>更に、昼までに東京に着かないといけなかったので、バスの3倍以上の値段がする新幹線を使わざるを得なくなりました。<br/><br/>痛い出費です。<br/><br/>以後気をつけたいです。
