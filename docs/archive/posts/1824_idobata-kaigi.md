井戸端会議<br/><br/>街を歩いているとたまに「井戸端会議」を見かけます。<br/><br/>「井戸端会議」とは、主婦同士などによる世間話やうわさ話のことです。<br/><br/>「井戸」は "well"、「端」は "side"、「会議」は "meeting" を意味するので、「井戸端会議」の文字どおりの意味は "a meeting at the well" となります。<br/><br/>かつて、水道がなく共同の井戸が使われていた頃、井戸は主婦が水くみや洗濯に集まる場となっていました。<br/><br/>井戸端では、よく近所の主婦たちが世間話やうわさ話に興じていたことから、そのようなおしゃべりを「井戸端会議」と呼ぶようになったというわけです。

<p class="correction_comment">1) If you mean "many people in many places used them often" (=it was common), then "wells were commonly used"<br/>2) If you mean "the same well was used by many people" (=in common), then "wells were used in common".<br/><br/>"Commonly" is OK for meaning #2, but could be confused for #1.</p>

 This is interesting, thank you! Similar to "water cooler talk" in English-language workplaces. :)

Thank you for correcting my post and letting me know the phrase!<br/>I learned something new. :)<br/><br/>&gt; "Commonly" is OK for meaning #2, but could be confused for #1.<br/>My Japanese post meant #2. But confusingly, it's not actually wrong what #1 means either. To make sense of both #1 and #2, how about the following sentence?<br/>"public wells were commonly used"

That's an excellent edit! Sometimes the hardest part is to find the right level of ambiguity, and I think that's a good choice.
