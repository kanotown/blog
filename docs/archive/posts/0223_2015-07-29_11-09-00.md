# The Japanese Tongue Twister "Sumomomomomomomomonouchi"
<div class="date">Jul 29, 2015 11:09</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will introduce two Japanese tongue twisters.<br/><br/>The first one is "sumomo mo momo mo momo nouchi."<br/><br/>In Japan, "momo" means "peach," and "sumomo" means "prune."<br/><br/>So the tongue twister means "prunes and peaches are included in a kind of peach."<br/><br/>Since we don't use spaces between words (like すももももももももものうち), it's difficult to read it in Japanese.<br/><br/>The second one is "haha wa hahaha, haha no haha wa hahahaha to warau."<br/><br/>This means "mother laugh with saying "haha," and mother's mother laugh with saying "hahaha.""<br/><br/>If we write it only in Katakana, it will be "ハハハハハハハノハハハハハハとワラウ."<br/><br/>This may look like a cipher.
