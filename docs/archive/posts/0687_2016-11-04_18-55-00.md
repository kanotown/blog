# <strong><em>Nuka ni Kugi</strong></em> (Nail Rice-bran Paste)
<div class="date">Nov 4, 2016 18:55</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese proverb "nuka ni kugi."<br/><br/>"Nuka" means "rice-bran paste," "kugi" means "nails", and "nuka ni kugi" is used to express that there is no effect.<br/><br/>For example: Giving a caution to him is nuka ni kugi (meaningless).<br/><br/>This proverb comes from the fact that even if you nail soft rice-bran paste, you can't obtain any effect.<br/><br/>Also, there is another proverb "noren ni udeoshi," which has the same meaning  as "nuka ni kugi."<br/><br/>"Noren" means a curtain-like cloth hanging down over an entrance of Japanese stores, and "udeoshi" means an arm wrestling.<br/><br/>Of course, to arm-wrestle with noren is meaningless like nuka ni kugi.

糠に釘<br/><br/>今日は、「糠に釘」ということわざを紹介します。<br/><br/>糠に釘は、手応えがなく、効き目がないことのたとえとして用いられます。<br/><br/>例「彼にはいくら注意しても糠に釘だ」<br/><br/>やわらかい糠に釘を打っても手応えがないことから来ています。<br/><br/>また、同じ意味を持つことわざとして「暖簾に腕押し」があります。<br/><br/>暖簾とは、建物の入口に仕切りとして垂らす布を、腕押しは腕相撲を意味します。<br/><br/>垂れている布に対して腕相撲をしても、何の手応えもありません。

 I think grammatically every sentence was perfect. I wrote in blue suggestions to make the text sound a little more natural.

 Wow! Japanese has a phrase like this? English has a phrase that is almost exactly the same! It's "that's like trying to nail Jell-o to the wall." Just like 糠に釘, it means that something is pointless.

 Here is a video where someone managed to do it, though!

Thank you very much for correcting my post again!<br/>Oh, I didn't know the phrase "that's like trying to nail Jell-o the wall." It's indeed quite similar to "nuka ni kugi!" I learned something new (^^)<br/><br/>This video is funny, haha :)
