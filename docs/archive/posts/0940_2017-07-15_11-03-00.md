# 【No. 0940】<strong><em>Kaminari and Inazuma</strong></em> (雷と稲妻 - Thunder and Lightning)
<div class="date">Jul 15, 2017 11:03</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
"Kaminari" (雷) is a natural phenomenon that generates light and sound due to discharge in the air, and is often translated as "thunder."<br/><br/>The etymology of "kaminari" is simple -- it comes from "kami no narasu oto" (神の鳴らす音), the literal meaning of which is "the sound rung by God."<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is another word "inazuma" (稲妻), which has the same meaning of "kaminari," though "inazuma" is often translated into "lightning." <br/><br/>The "ina" (稲) of "inazuma" means "rice," and "zuma/tsuma" (妻) means "husband" here. <br/>(Note that "tsuma" means "wife" now, but once it could mean both "wife" and "husband.")<br/><br/>Thunder/lightning often occurs from summer to autumn, which is when rice grows.<br/><br/>Because of this, it was thought that lightning is a husband of rice (ine/ina no tsuma/zuma), and we have come to call lightning "inazuma."

雷と稲妻<br/><br/>「雷」は、空気中の放電によって光と音を発生する自然現象です。<br/><br/>この言葉の語源はシンプルで、「神が鳴らす音」から来ています。<br/><br/>一方、同じ自然現象を指す言葉に「稲妻」があります。<br/><br/>「稲」は「稲穂」を意味し、「妻」は現在の意味とは異なりここでは「夫」を意味します。<br/><br/>雷は稲穂が実る夏から秋にかけて多く発生します。<br/><br/>このため、雷は稲を実らせることができる「稲の夫（つま）」であると考えられ、稲妻とも呼ばれるようになりました。
