クロワッサン<br/><br/>私はクロワッサンが好きですが、その意味を知りませんでした。<br/><br/>クロワッサンはフランス語で、三日月を意味するようです。<br/><br/>しかし、日本のパン屋で売られているクロワッサンの多くは、三角形の形をしています。<br/><br/>見た目はロールパンに近く、三日月の形ではありません。<br/><br/>三日月型はバターを使用するのに対し、三角形型はマーガリンを使用しているようです。<br/><br/>三角形のクロワッサンをクロワッサンと呼んでいいのか、よくわかりません。

 They are called CUSTARD TRIANGLE.
 <br/>
 Actually there is a huge variety of croussants in Switzerland. But a leading country for producing pastries for sure is France. A classical croissant is with nothing inside. However it can have a different size. In Switzerland you can meet them with chocolate or batter inside as well. And each of these pastrie has a different name.

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/>I didn't know the custard triangle, but it looks yummy :P<br/>Triangle shape croissants that I said are something like the following:<br/><a href="http://thesepeasarehollow.blogspot.jp/2011/02/ode-to-croissant-homemade-croissant.html" target="_blank">http://thesepeasarehollow.blogspot.jp/2011/02/ode-to-croissant-homemade-croissant.html</a><br/><br/>&gt; Actually there is a huge variety of croissants in Switzerland.<br/>Sounds fantastic. In Japan, sometimes croissants with chocolate inside are sold, but I have never met and eaten other types. Someday I really want to Switzerland and eat a huge variety of croissants (๑´﹃`๑)

Ok, this looks more like a croissant. :)<br/>If you are a big fun of pasties, I would recommend you to go to France. But be ready to make 1-2 month of intensive sport after :) <br/>I still cannot get how do French women do this because they look well built even in old age. :)

'Croissant' is the word borrowed from French, and means crescent moon.

I'm sorry, I made a mistake.<br/>According to the Internet, in France, triangle shape croissants are called "croissant au beurre," and "beurre" means butter, while crescent shape are called "croissant ordinaire," and margarine seems to be used because margarin is ordinary. Japanese like to follow original style, so I think they make them with butter.
