<strong><em>Nigashita Sakana wa Ookii</strong></em><br/><br/>Today, I knew that I missed a very big chance.<br/><br/>However, something that you were about to get but missed may looks greater than it is.<br/><br/>There is a proverb to express the fact; it is <strong><em>nigashita sakana wa ookii</em></strong> (逃がした魚は大きい).<br/><br/><strong><em>Nigashita</em></strong> (逃がした) means "missed," <strong><em>sakana</em></strong> (魚) means "fish," and <strong><em>ookii</em></strong> (大きい) means "big," so the literal meaning of this proverb is "the missed fish was big."<br/><br/>Anyway, in order not to regret, I will try to seize a chance as soon as it comes in front of me.

逃した魚は大きい<br/><br/>私は今日、とても大きなチャンスを逃していたことを知りました。<br/><br/>しかし、手に入りそうで逃したものは、大きく見えるのかもしれません。<br/><br/>そのようなことを表すことわざに「逃した魚は大きい」があります。<br/><br/>「逃した」は "missed"、「魚」は "fish"、「大きい」は "big" を意味するので、このことわざの文字どおりの意味は "the missed fish was big" となります。<br/><br/>どちらにしても、後悔をしないために、次にチャンスが目の前に来たらすぐに手を伸ばそうと思います。
