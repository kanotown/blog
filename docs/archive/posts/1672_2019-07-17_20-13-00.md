生意気<br/><br/>私は以前、"impudent" や "isolent" を意味する「しゃらくさい」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>「しゃらくさい」は現在ではあまり使われず、"impudent" や "insolent" に相当する最も一般的な日本語は「生意気」です。<br/><br/>「生」は何かが中途半端なこと、「意気」は積極的な心構えのことを意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち「生意気」は、「中途半端な心構えで出すぎた言動をとること」を意味するというわけです。<br/><br/>「生意気」は、「人」や「発言」、「態度」などの前につくことが多いです。

Thank you for the correction! :)<br/>&gt; Impudent isn't a common word. Where did you learn it?<br/>I found this word when looking up the English translation of 生意気 in my dictionary.

Oh okay. I recommend just using 'insolent'.
