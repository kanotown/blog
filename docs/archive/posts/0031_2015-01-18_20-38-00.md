<h1 id="subject_show">Got a New Nintendo 3DS</h1>
<div class="date">Jan 18, 2015 20:38</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I studied English for 6 hours on the internet learning site of my university.<br/><br/>I was happy to earn high score on that site, and I bought a New Nintendo 3DS as a reward for myself.<br/><br/>Now, Nintendo is doing New Nintendo 3DS campaign which allow a 40 percent discount off several downloadable titles.<br/><br/>So I bought "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D", and played it.<br/><br/>I was impressed with 3D viewing, however, it was really tiring to keep playing.<br/><br/>About after 30 minutes, headache occurred and I closed the 3DS gently.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, 3D viewing seems not suitable to my eyes...
