<h1 id="subject_show">Sundry and Various</h1>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to ask you a question about the word <em>sundry,</em> which I learned a little while ago.<br/><br/>According to my English word book, the meaning of <em>sundry</em> is almost the same as the one of  'various.'<br/><br/>Also, the Internet says that <em>sundry</em> means <em>various</em> in modern English.<br/><br/>Is it natural that using <em>sundry</em> instead of 'various'?<br/><br/>For example, I often write sentences like "various methods have been proposed," but can I rewrite this like "sundry methods have been proposed?"<br/><br/>I would really appreciate it if you could let me know about the nuances.

今日は、新しく学んだ単語「sundry」について質問があります。<br/><br/>私の英単語帳によると、「sundry」の意味は「various」とほとんど同じです。<br/><br/>また、インターネットによると、「sundry」は「various」の近代英語表現と書かれていました。<br/><br/>「Sundry」を「various」の代わりに使っても不自然ではないでしょうか？<br/><br/>例えば、私はよく「various methods have been proposed」のような表現を書くのですが、「sundry methods have been proposed」のように書き換えが可能でしょうか。<br/><br/>ニュアンスの違いなどを教えて頂けましたら幸いです。

For example, I often write sentences like "various methods have been proposed"; can I rewrite this as "sundry methods have been proposed?"
<p class="correction_comment">I would say not, because when used as an adjective sundry carries a nuance of random, which various does not. A proposal being a considered suggestion would not be appropriately described as sundry I think. If the sentence read as "Sundry methods had been tried" then that seems to me to be fine.</p>

 A sundry is also a miscellaneous item available in a store, as I'm sure you probably know.

Thank you very much for the corrections and your comments!<br/>I understand the nuances well. :)<br/><br/>&gt; as I'm sure you probably know.<br/>I'm ashamed to say, I didn't know that (though my dictionary showed "sundry goods" as the meaning of "miscellaneous items"). Thank you for letting me know. :)

 Sundry is uncommon. I think it's a cool word, but it sounds a little old-fashioned. Various is very commonly used.

 I checked a dictionary online and it said that "sundries" (plural) refers to various objects that are not worth naming.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For example: If I said, "the box was full of sundries," I would mean that the box was full of random objects and that the names of those objects are not important.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It seems that the word "sundry" is used mainly to refer to a small thing.

Thank you very much for your corrections and the kind explanation! :D<br/>Now I understand the nuance of 'sundry.'<br/>It seems to be better to use 'various' innocuously in my scientific papers. :)
