<div class="date">Oct 1, 2017 16:35</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I think that recently the Japanese word "sushi" has come to be used in various countries.<br/><br/>Among various kind of sushi, do you know "inari zushi" (稲荷寿司)?<br/><br/>"Inari zushi" is a sushi made by stuffing with vinegared rice in a deep-fried tofu (bean curd).<br/><br/>In some Japanese shrines, the Shinto god Inari (稲荷) is enshrined.<br/><br/>Also, we have served fried tofu to these shrines, because shinshi (神使 - divine servant) of the god is fox, and it has been believed that the favorite food of foxes is the fried tofu.<br/>(Since foxes are actually carnivorous, this theory is wrong.)<br/><br/>Because of this, dishes that contain fried food has been called "inari," then "inari zushi" was born.

稲荷寿司<br/><br/>近年、さまざまな国で「寿司」という言葉が使われるようになってきたと思います。<br/><br/>その中の、「稲荷司」という種類の寿司をご存知でしょうか？<br/><br/>「稲荷寿司」は、甘辛く煮た油揚げの中に酢飯を詰めた寿司のことを表します。<br/><br/>日本の幾つかの神社では、穀物・農業（現在では産業も含む）神である稲荷神が祀られています。<br/><br/>そして稲荷神の神使は狐であり、狐の好物は豆腐の油揚げであると信じら、供えられてきました。<br/>（狐は実際には肉食なので、油揚げが好物というわけではありません。）<br/><br/>このことから、油揚げを使う料理を「稲荷」と呼ぶようになり、「稲荷寿司」が生まれました。
