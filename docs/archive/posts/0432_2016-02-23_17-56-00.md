# 【No. 0432】<strong><em>Fujisan</strong></em> (Mount Fuji) Day
<div class="date">Feb 23, 2016 17:56</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, February 23 is the Fujisan Day.<br/><br/>The reason is because we can read "2" as "fu(tatsu)" and "ji," and "3" as "san."<br/><br/>This day was established by Shizuoka Prefecture and Yamanashi Prefecture, where the Mount Fuji is located.<br/><br/>In many public schools in Shizuoka Prefecture, today seems to be a holiday.<br/><br/>Also, there are a lot of events related to Mount Fuji in various places.<br/><br/>It sounds fun, but there is almost no event in other prefecture.<br/><br/>Actually, I just found out the day today.

富士山の日<br/><br/>今日2月23日は、富士山の日です。<br/><br/>日本語で「2」は「ふたつ」や「じ」と読むことができ、「3」は「さん」と読むことができるからです。<br/><br/>これは富士山が位置する静岡県と山梨県が制定した日で、静岡県の多くの学校は休みだそうです。<br/><br/>そして色々な場所で、富士山に関するイベントが行われているようです。<br/><br/>楽しそうですが、他の県ではあまり関係がありません。<br/><br/>私も今日、知りました。

Thank you very much always for correcting my post! :)<br/>I think this day will never be a national holiday, because the national holiday called "山の日 (Mountain Day)" is overlapping "Fujisan Day," haha.
