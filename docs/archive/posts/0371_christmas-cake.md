クリスマスケーキ<br/><br/>今日は知人からクリスマスケーキをもらいました。<br/><br/>イチゴやキャラメル、チョコ、抹茶、みかん、モンブランなど、様々な種類のケーキが入っていました。<br/><br/>お昼ごはんの後、研究室の皆で食べました。<br/><br/>美味しかったです。<br/><br/>しかし悲しいことに、今年のクリスマスイブとクリスマスには、他に何も予定がありません。

<p class="correction_comment">If you want to keep "a shortcake, a..." you have to change the beginning of the sentence. Something like, "There was a....". Then you could list them all. The correction sounds more natural and complex, however.</p>

Thank you so much for the corrections and helpful comments! :D<br/>Actually, I ate just one of them, but other people also said "it's delicious," so I should have written "they were delicious!"
