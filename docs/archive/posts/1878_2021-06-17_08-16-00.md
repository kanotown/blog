# 【No. 1878】<strong><em>Kuchi ga Karui</strong></em> (口が軽い - Having a Big Mouth)
<div class="date">Jun 17, 2021 08:16</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kuchi ga Karui</strong></em><br/><br/>People who have a big mouth can be described as <strong><em>kuchi ga karui</em></strong> (口が軽い) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>kuchi</em></strong> (口) means "mouth" and <strong><em>karui</em></strong> (軽い) means "light," the literal meaning of <em>kuchi ga karui</em> is "one's mouth is light."<br/><br/>Here, the Chinese character 軽 is used in terms such as <strong><em>karuhazumi</em></strong> (軽はずみ) and <strong><em>keisotsu</em></strong> (軽率), both of which means "rash" or "thoughtless". <br/><br/>From this, it is thought that <em>kuchi ga karui</em> came to mean "people who talk a lot rashly."

口が軽い<br/><br/>おしゃべりで、言ってはいけないことまですぐに言ってしまう人は、日本語で「口が軽い」と形容されます。<br/><br/>「口」は "mouth"、「軽い」は "light" を意味するので、「口が軽い」の文字どおりの意味は "one's mouth is light" です。<br/><br/>「軽」という漢字は、「軽はずみ」や「軽率」など、「深く考えない行動」を表す際に使われます。<br/><br/>このことから、「口が軽い」は「よく考えずにいろいろなことを話す」という意味を持つようになったものと考えられます。

<p class="correction_comment">no comma needed<br/>'to speak rashly' is not very natural in English, this expression could be translated as 'having a loose tongue; being talkative; speaking without thinking; being unable to keep a secret'</p>

 Idioms are very interesting things in a language. Sometimes the origin of some is completely unknown, but somehow they are still around us~
