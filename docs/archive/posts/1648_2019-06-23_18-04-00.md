<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Kenage</strong></em> (健気 - Admirable)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Jun 23, 2019 18:04</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kenage</strong></em><br/><br/>I like people who have a character described as <strong><em>kenage</em></strong> (健気).<br/><br/><em>Kenage</em> means that someone has a good/solid attitude, or a vulnerable person (especially a child/woman) strives with difficulties.<br/><br/><em>Kenage</em> is short for <strong><em>kenarige</em></strong> (けなり気), which is combining <strong><em>kenari</em></strong> (けなり) and <strong><em>ge/ke</em></strong> (気); here <em>kenari</em> is an old Japanese word meaning "different," and <em>ge/ke</em> means "feeling."<br/><br/>Because of this, <em>kenage</em> originally used to describe different or excellent people.<br/><br/>It came to have the above meanings deriving from that, and now it often means that a person strives with difficulties.

健気<br/><br/>私は「健気」な性格の人が好きです。<br/><br/>「健気」とは、心がけがよくしっかりしているさまや、力の弱いもの（子どもや女性）が困難に立ち向かうさまを表す言葉です。<br/><br/>「健気」はほかと異なることを意味する古語「けなり」に、"feeling" を意味する「気」がついた「けなり気」を省略したものです。<br/><br/>このため、もともと「健気」は人が優れているさまを表す言葉でした。<br/><br/>そこから派生して前述のような意味が生じ、現在では「力の弱いものが困難に立ち向かうさま」を意味することが多いです。
