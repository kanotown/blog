<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Recently, I often hear that Pokemon GO is becoming popular in the world.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether or not it made an effect, but a lyrics of  Pikachu's theme song "Pikachu no uta" (Pikachu's song) was published yesterday.<br/><br/>The stock price of Nintendo reached more than double for the price of before Pokemon GO was released.<br/><br/>It was composed of only Pikachu's call, there were a lot of "pika" and "pikachu."<br/><br/>A part of the lyrics is something like the following:<br/><br/>Pikkachu pikkachu pika pika pikachu pika pika<br/><br/>I can't understand what the song means at all.<br/><br/>However, somehow I'd like to listen to this song at least once.

ピカチュウのうた<br/><br/>最近、ポケモンGOが世界で流行っているとよく耳にします。<br/><br/>任天堂の株価は、ポケモンGOのリリース前の2倍を超えました。<br/><br/>その影響かどうかはわかりませんが、ピカチュウのテーマソング「ピカチュウうた」の歌詞が昨日発表されました。<br/><br/>ピカチュウの鳴き声だけなので、ひたすら「ピカ」や「ピカチュウ」の文字が並んでいます。<br/><br/>歌詞の一部は以下のとおりです。<br/><br/>ピッカチュピッカチュピカピカピカチュウピカピカ<br/><br/>どんな歌なのか、全くわかりません。<br/><br/>しかし、なぜだか少し聴いてみたいです。

 I've been playing Pokemon GO a bit everyday, and I see a ton of people walking around playing it. I hear the game is going to be releasing in Japan in a few hours. Are you going to play it when it comes out?
