高尾山<br/><br/>今、日本ではゴールデンウィークです。<br/><br/>今日は、八王子市にある高尾山を登りました。<br/><br/>標高599mの比較的小さな山ですが、都心から近いこともあり、多くの観光客が訪れます。<br/><br/>ルートは5つほどあり、総じて1時間半〜2時間程で山頂に到達します。<br/><br/>ケーブルカーやリフトなどもあり、気軽に山頂付近まで行くこともできます。<br/><br/>私は初めてでしたが、少しだけ険しいルートを選んでみました。<br/><br/>しかし、運動不足ということもあり、ものすごくきつかったです。

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/>&gt; mountain name has san???<br/>Yes, "san" (or "zan" or "yama") means "mountain."<br/>"San" of "Fujisan (Mt. Fuji)" also means mountain. :)
