食べた後すぐ寝ると牛になる<br/><br/>日本には、次のような有名な迷信があります。<br/><br/>「食べた後すぐ寝ると牛になる」<br/><br/>実際、私もそのように教わりました。<br/><br/>何故「牛」かはよくわかりませんが、「牛のように太るぞ」ということを言っているのだと思われます。<br/><br/>食べてすぐ寝るのは行儀が悪いとされているため、そのような行為を戒めるためにこの迷信が作られました。<br/><br/>しかし、医学的な観点からすると、食後は30分ほど横になって寝たほうが、消化に良いそうです。

 Regarding superstitions we have one that you shouldn't bathe/shower/shave soon after having a meal, it's supposedly very dangerous.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The time varies from 1 to 3 hours.
