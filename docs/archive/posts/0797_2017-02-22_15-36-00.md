図に乗る<br/><br/>今日は「図に乗る」という日本の慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>「図に乗る」は、調子に乗ることや、つけあがることを意味します。<br/><br/>ここで「図」は、仏教で僧が唱える声楽「声明」での転調を表します。<br/><br/>もともとは、吟唱中にうまく転調することを「図に乗る」と呼んでいました。<br/><br/>この転調は難しかったため、「図に乗る」は「事がうまく運ぶ」ということを表すようになり、上述した現在のような意味に変化しました。<br/><br/>「図に乗る」と「調子に乗る」はどちらも似た意味を表しますが、「調子に乗る」は良い意味でも悪い意味でも使われる一方、「図に乗る」は主に悪い意味で用いられます。
