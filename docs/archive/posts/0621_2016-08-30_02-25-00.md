# 【No. 0621】<strong><em>Shikii ga Takai</strong></em> (The Threshold is High)
<div class="date">Aug 30, 2016 02:25</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "shikii ga takai," which seems to be misunderstood by more than half of Japanese people.<br/><br/>"Shikii" means a threshold that is located in an entrance or gate, and you have to cross the shikii to enter the house.<br/><br/>If you feel the threshold is high (shikii ga takai), it implies that you don't want to enter the house.<br/><br/>That is to say, "shikii ga takai" means "it's difficult to enter the house BECAUSE I made trouble there in the past."<br/><br/>However, many Japanese people use this phrase to mean "it's difficult," "it's too high level," or "it's out of my league."<br/><br/>In such cases, it's correct to use "ハードルが高い" (the hudedle is high) or "分不相応" (it's out of my league).<br/><br/>If you find someone improperly using "shikii ga takai," please point it out.

敷居が高い<br/><br/>今日は、日本人の半数以上が勘違いをしていると言われる「敷居が高い」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「敷居」とは、玄関の扉や門の開口部にある溝で、家に入る際にまたぐ必要があります。<br/><br/>敷居が高く感じるならば、その家に入りたくないという気持ちの現れです。<br/><br/>すなわち、「敷居が高い」とは「その家に迷惑をかけたことがあって入りにくい」という意味です。<br/><br/>しかし、単に「難しい」や、「自分にとってはレベルが高い」「自分には相応しくない」という意味で使う日本人がとても多いです。<br/><br/>このような場合は、「ハードルが高い」や「分不相応」といった言葉を使うのが正解です。<br/><br/>間違って使っている日本人がいたら、教えてあげて下さい。
