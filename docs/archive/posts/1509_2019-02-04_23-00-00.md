旧正月<br/><br/>今日は旧正月の大晦日です。<br/><br/>旧正月は、中国や台湾、韓国、シンガポール、マレーシア、ベトナムなどで祝います。<br/><br/>特に中国では、大晦日から7日間の連休となっており、盛大に祝います。<br/><br/>私の研究室には中国人の留学生がいるため、今日は研究室で水餃子パーティが行われました。<br/><br/>大量の水餃子を食べて、とてもお腹が膨れました。<br/><br/>日本に住んでいる彼らは7日間も休めないので、少しかわいそうです。

<p class="comment_small">
 In Chinese, fried dumplings are called “鍋貼” (pot-stickers) because they stick to the frying pan. People want them to stick to the pan so that the skin will be crisp. But if boiled dumplings stick to the pot they are ruined, so 水餃 (boiled dumplings) are not called pot stickers (鍋貼) in China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Are 水餃子 called 鍋貼 in Japan?

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/><br/>I understand. I should have not used "pot stickers" because they don't stick to the pan.<br/>In Japan, pot stickers (鍋貼) are called yaki-gyoza (焼餃子), and boiled dumplings are called sui-gyoza (水餃子). What we ate were just boiled dumplings.
