<div class="date">Apr 13, 2017 09:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I talked about the etymology of the Japanese word, "narikin," which means "new rich."<br/><br/>According to an ancient Greek philosopher called Aristotle, narikin (new riches) have the following characteristics.<br/><br/>They have a characteristic of a foolish person who has a good luck.<br/><br/>They act big and look down others because they think that they have all good things.<br/><br/>They show off their money.<br/><br/>They think of money as the standard of all evaluation.<br/><br/>Incidentally, originally in Japan, "narikin" (new rich) was used in a good sense.<br/><br/>However, now it is often used to express feelings of mockery or hatred.

成金の特徴<br/><br/>昨日は「成金」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>古代ギリシャの哲学者であるアリストテレスは、成金は以下のような性質を持っていると評しています。<br/><br/>一言で言えば、幸運に恵まれた愚か者の性格。<br/><br/>良いものをすべて持っている気になっているため、いばって他人を見下す。<br/><br/>贅沢を見せびらかす。<br/><br/>金がすべての評価の基準になっている。<br/><br/>ちなみに、もともと日本では「成金」という言葉は、良い意味で使われていました。<br/><br/>しかし現在では、嘲りや憎みを込めて使われることが多いです。

<p class="correction_comment">The reason I lined-out "mockery" is because it isn't an emotion, so it can't be felt from within.</p>

 Thank you again for sharing more about the word narikin and its connotations. I'm acquainted with some people who could be called narikin, even though they don't flaunt their wealth. They're actually quite frugal, but I think they have questionable political views.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you so much for correcting my post again! :)<br/>Yes, these characteristics are just a tendency, so there are many good people who could be called narikin. However, if they don't flaunt their wealth, it may be difficult to find that they are narikin, haha.
