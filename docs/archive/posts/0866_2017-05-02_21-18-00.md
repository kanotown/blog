<h1 id="subject_show">Chiya-hoya</h1>
<div class="date">May 2, 2017 21:18</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese term "chiya-hoya."<br/><br/>"Chiya-hoya" means that someone is payed attention or is treated indulgently.<br/><br/>This term is derived from the idiom "choyo hanayo," the literal meaning of which is "as with a butterfly or a flower," and it means that someone is pampered and spoiled.<br/><br/>The reason why "choyo hanayo" expresses the meaning is because both butterflies and flowers are beautiful and are nurtured carefully.<br/><br/>Originally, it was "hanaya choya," and it changed to "choya hanaya," finally "choyo hanayo."<br/><br/>As you can image, "choya hanaya" in the process of the change became "chiya hoya" for short.

ちやほや<br/><br/>今日は「ちやほや」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ちやほや」は、相手の機嫌をとったり、甘やかしたりするさまを表します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、親が子どもを大切に育てることを表す「蝶よ花よ」という慣用句に由来します。<br/><br/>「蝶よ花よ」は、「蝶」も「花」も可憐で美しく、大事に育てられることに由来します。<br/><br/>もともとは「花や蝶や」だったのが「蝶や花や」、「蝶よ花よ」と変化し、この過程の「蝶や花や」が短縮されたものが「ちやほや」だとされています。
