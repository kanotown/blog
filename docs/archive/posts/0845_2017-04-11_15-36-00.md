# 【No. 0845】Chu Chu Tako Kaina
<div class="date">Apr 11, 2017 15:36</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "chu chu tako kaina."<br/><br/>This term is a kind of counting rhymes, which is used when counting the number of something in two units (it's something like "two, four, six, eight...").<br/><br/>There are several theories about this term, but the most widely accepted one is something like the following.<br/><br/>The word "chu" comes from the sugoroku (Japanese backgammon) term "juji," which means double two, that is four.<br/><br/>When you say "chu chu," it means eight, and this number represents the number of octopus' legs.<br/><br/>Therefore, we came to say "tako kaina," which means "is it an octopus?," after "chu chu."

ちゅうちゅうたこかいな<br/><br/>今日は「ちゅうちゅうたこかいな」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、2個単位でものの数を数える際に利用される、数え歌の一種です。<br/><br/>語源には幾つかの説がありますが、最も有力な説は以下のようなものです。<br/><br/>「ちゅう」という言葉は、平安時代に流行っていた双六で用いられた「重二」に由来します。<br/><br/>「重二」は2が重なること、つまり2のゾロ目を意味し、数字を足すと4になります。<br/><br/>「ちゅうちゅう」と2回続けて言うことで数字は8となり、タコの足の本数とかけて「たこかいな」と続けるようなったそうです。

 Very well explained! I would have thought 'chu chu' is 16 (4 x 4).
