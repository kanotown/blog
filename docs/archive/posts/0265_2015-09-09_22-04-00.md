# 【No. 0265】Bus Trip
<div class="date">Sep 9, 2015 22:04</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I got on a highway bus to Kyoto for seven hours, and got on a train to Osaka for one and half hours.<br/><br/>Since I get carsick easily, I was sleeping most of the time I was on the bus.<br/><br/>However, somehow I was very tired, so I slept again on arrival at a hotel.<br/><br/>I wonder how many time I can sleep.<br/><br/>I might not sleep tonight because of sleeping too much.

バスでの旅行<br/><br/>今日は、7時間バスに乗って京都へ行き、1時間半電車に乗って大阪に行きました。<br/><br/>私はバス酔いするので、バスに乗っている間はほとんど寝ていました。<br/><br/>しかし、ホテルに着いたらすごく疲れていて、また寝てしまいました。<br/><br/>一体どれだけの時間寝られるのだろうと疑問に感じています。<br/><br/>寝過ぎたせいで、今夜は眠れないかもしれません。

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>Yes, I think I should have used the Shinkansen(though it's expensive).

 Did you take any medicine? Sometimes motion-sickness medicine can make you very sleepy. Take care and good post.

Thank you very much for correcting me! :D<br/>Actually, I took a medicine for headache a few hours before I got on the bus. This could be the reason, thank you for the advice!
