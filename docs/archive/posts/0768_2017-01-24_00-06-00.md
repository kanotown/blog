<div class="date">Jan 24, 2017 00:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "obenchara."<br/><br/>"Obenchara" means to say empty flattery for buttering up to someone, or means such a person.<br/><br/>Usage example: "Don't say obenchara (empty flattery)." "You are an obenchara (polisher)."<br/><br/>The "o" in "obenchara" is a prefix word, "ben" means "speech" and "chara" means "joke" or "gibberish."<br/><br/>I like the sound of "obenchara," but I don't like "obenchara" very much.<br/><br/>There is another word called "obekka," which means almost the same meaning of "obenchara."<br/><br/>It is said that "obekka" comes from the word "obenko," which means that someone is good at flattery.

おべんちゃら<br/><br/>今日は「おべんちゃら」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「おべんちゃら」は、相手の機嫌をとろうと口先だけのお世辞を言うことや、そのような人を表す言葉です。<br/><br/>例：「おべんちゃらを言うのはやめてくれ。」「君はおべんちゃらなところがあるね。」<br/><br/>「おべんちゃら」の「お」は接頭語で、「べん」は「話しぶり」、「ちゃら」は「冗談」「でたらめ」を意味します。<br/><br/>私は「おべんちゃら」という言葉の響きは好きですが、「おべんちゃら」はあまり好きではありません。<br/><br/>「おべんちゃら」とほとんど同じ意味を表す言葉に、「おべっか」があります。<br/><br/>「おべっか」は、口がうまいことを意味する「お弁口」から来ていると言われています。
