<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday my physical condition was bad, so I slept after I went shopping and ate lunch.<br/><br/>Then the intercom rang, and the door opened while I was going to the entrance.<br/><br/>No doubt I forgot to lock the door.<br/><br/>I was very surprised because a stranger tried to enter my room.<br/><br/>The man also looked surprised, and he said "sorry, I made a mistake," then he left.<br/><br/>I was a little scared.

不審者<br/><br/>私は昨日体調が悪かったので、買い物に出かけてお昼ご飯を食べた後寝ていました。<br/><br/>するとインターホンが鳴り、なんだろうと玄関に向かうと、扉が開きました。<br/><br/>買い物の後、鍵を閉めるのを忘れていたようです。<br/><br/>扉からは見知らぬ男が入ってこようとして、驚きました。<br/><br/>男も驚いている様子で、「すみません、間違えました」と言って去って行きました。<br/><br/>ちょっと怖かったです。

Yesterday <span class="f_blue">I didn't feel so well</span> so I slept after I went shopping and ate lunch.
<p class="correction_comment">"my physical condition was bad" sounds very clinical, or stiff. "I didn't feel so well" sounds much more natural in this context.</p>
