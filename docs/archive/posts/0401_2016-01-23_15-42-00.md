Today, I learned about colors that symbolize "death" for each country.<br/><br/>In many countries, such as the US, Europe, China, and Japan, people think the symbol color of death is "black."<br/><br/>The reason seems to be derived from that black is associated with darkness and people wear black costumes in funerals.<br/><br/>However, it is "green" in South America.<br/><br/>The reason seems to be due to the thought that the dead are equal to nature.<br/><br/>By the way, the symbol color of death is "white" for Hindus, and "silver" for Muslims.

死の色<br/><br/>今日は、国ごとの「死」を象徴する色について調べました。<br/><br/>欧米、中国、日本など、多くの国では「死」は「黒」というイメージを持っています。<br/><br/>恐らく、黒は闇を連想させることや、葬式が黒装束であることから来ていると思われます。<br/><br/>しかし、南アメリカでは「緑」でした。<br/><br/>これは、死者と自然は一体という思想から来ているものと考えられます。<br/><br/>また、ヒンドゥー教徒は「白」、イスラム教徒は「銀」でした。

 Interesting post as always!
 <br/>
 In my opinion, it is black, and it is certainly true that I associate it with the darkness. Moreover, I am Chinese so I guess that's why I think that way!

Thank you very much for the corrections and comments!<br/>I also associate black with the darkness and death. I think it may be natural sense :)

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; Is it really green in all countries of South America, and in all of the different cultures in those countries?<br/>I'm sorry, I think it's not true in a precise sense. There seems to be a strong religious tradition based on animism or polytheism in many countries in South America. And the color symbolizing death is "green" for them. Actually, there remains a tradition of planting trees around graves also in (parts of) Japan.
