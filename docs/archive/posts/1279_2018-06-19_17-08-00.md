嘘つきは泥棒の始まり<br/><br/>ほとんどの人は、嘘をついたことがあると思います。<br/><br/>日本には嘘にまつわることわざ、「嘘つきは泥棒の始まり」があります。<br/><br/>「嘘つき」は 'lying' や 'liar,' 「泥棒」は 'thief' や 'stealing' 「始まり」は 'beginning' を意味するので、このことわざの文字通りの意味は "lying is the beginning of stealing" となります。<br/><br/>平気で人に嘘をつく用になってしまうと、良心が亡くなり、盗みのような悪事も平気ではたらくようになってしまうということです。<br/><br/>調べてみたら、英語にも "He that will lie will steal" や "Lying and stealing are next door neighbors" といった似た表現がありました。
