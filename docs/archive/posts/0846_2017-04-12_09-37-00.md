Today I will talk about the word "narikin."<br/><br/>"Narikin" means a person who became rich in a short period, and it corresponds to the term "new rich" in English.<br/><br/>This word comes from a kind of board games, "shogi," which is similar to chess.<br/><br/>In shogi, when pieces except the king (ohsho) and gold generals (kinsho) enter the enemy territory, they can change their characters (this act is called "naru" in Japanese).<br/><br/>In particular, if the ranks of these pieces are lower than gold generals, they can change to new pieces that are equivalent to the gold general (kinsho).<br/><br/>From this rule, a person who suddenly became rich came to be called "narikin" (change to a gold general).

成金<br/><br/>今日は「成金」という単語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「成金」とは、短期間でお金持ちになった人のことを意味し、英語の "new rich" という言葉に相当します。<br/><br/>「成金」という言葉は、ボードゲームの一つである将棋に由来します。<br/><br/>将棋では、王将・金将以外の駒が敵陣に入ったとき、成ることができます。<br/><br/>特に、金将よりもランクの低い駒が成ると、金将と同じ動きになります。<br/><br/>これが転じて、急に裕福になった人のことを「成金」と呼ぶようになりました。

 That's really interesting, thank you for sharing! Is "narikin" ever used as an insult? Apparently "nouveau riche," which is the English equivalent, is a derogatory term.

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/>Yes, in most cases, "narikin" is used as an insult in Japan. <br/>However, I heard that actually it was used as a word of praise until around WW2.
