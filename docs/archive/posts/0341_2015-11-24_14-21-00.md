パジャマの危険性<br/><br/>マットレスメーカー Ergoflex 社の調査によると、男性は平均13日、女性は平均17日間、同じパジャマを洗わずに使っているそうです。<br/><br/>私も一週間くらいは洗わないことが多いです。<br/><br/>しかし、たとえパジャマが臭わなかったとしても、大量の皮膚細胞や微生物が付着しているようです。<br/><br/>そして、それらは皮膚や腸にいる場合は大抵無害ですが、切り傷などから感染症を起こしたり、膀胱炎になったりする恐れがあるそうです。<br/><br/>さらに、二週間以上洗っていないパジャマを洗濯すると、他の衣類に菌が移る可能性もあります。<br/><br/>専門家によると、寝る前にシャワーを浴びる人は少なくとも1周間に1回、朝にシャワーを浴びる人は3日に1回洗うのがよいそうです。
