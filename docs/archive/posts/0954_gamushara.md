# 【No. 0954】<strong><em>Gamushara</strong></em> (がむしゃら - Headlong)
<div class="date">Jul 29, 2017 14:50</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Have you ever taken an adventurous action towards a purpose?<br/><br/>Such an action is called "gamushara" (がむしゃら) in Japan.<br/><br/>This term is composed of "gamusha" (がむしゃ) and the suffix "ra" (ら).<br/><br/>"Gamusha" is written as "我武者" in kanji, and its literal meaning is "self-assertive samurai," so this is often thought as the etymology of "gamushara."<br/><br/>Besides, there are several theories about the etymology of "gamushara," for example, it comes from "gamusho," which means to feel an irresistible desire to do something, or "musha kusha," which is a onomatopoeia that refers to something uncomfortable and restless.

がむしゃら<br/><br/>何か一つの目的に向かって、向こう見ずな行動をとったことはありますか？<br/><br/>そのような行動のことを、日本語で「がむしゃら」と言います。<br/><br/>この言葉は、「がむしゃ」に接尾語の「ら」が付いたものです。<br/><br/>「がむしゃ」を漢字で書くと「我武者」となり、「我の強い武者」という意味になり、これを語源とする説が有名です。<br/><br/>他にも、我を忘れて無性に何かをしたいという意味の「我無性」が転じたとする説や、不愉快で落ち着かない様子を表す「むしゃくしゃ」という擬音語から来たという説などがあります。
