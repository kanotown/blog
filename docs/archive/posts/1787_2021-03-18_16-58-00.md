# Limited Graduation Ceremony
<div class="date">Mar 18, 2021 16:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Limited Graduation Ceremony<br/><br/>Today, my university held a graduation ceremony at Nippon Budokan with restricted admission.<br/><br/>No graduates' families were allowed to attend, and only graduates and faculty members were able to attend.<br/><br/>Participation is not mandatory, and some graduates and faculty members were absent.<br/><br/>Although it was a limited graduation ceremony, I felt that it was a big change compared to the graduation ceremony last year that was canceled due to COVID-19.<br/><br/>Of course, attendees were required to go home promptly after the graduation ceremony.<br/><br/>I hope that we will be able to hold a thank-you party or a graduation party next year.

制限付きの卒業式<br/><br/>私の大学は今日、日本武道館で入場制限をしながら卒業式を実施しました。<br/><br/>卒業生の家族は参列不可で、卒業生と教員のみが出席可能でした。<br/><br/>欠席した卒業生や教員もそれなりにいたようです。<br/><br/>制限付きの卒業式ではありましたが、昨年は新型コロナウィルスの影響で中止になったことと比べると、大きな変化に感じました。<br/><br/>もちろん、卒業式終了後は、速やかに帰宅することが求められました。<br/><br/>来年には、卒業式後に謝恩会や記念パーティができるような状況になっていることを願います。
