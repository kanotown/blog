<div class="date">Jun 14, 2016 10:49</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese words "amato" and "karato," which are often misused.<br/><br/>"Ama" in "amato" means "sweet," "kara" in "karato" means "spicy," and "to" means "(political) party."<br/><br/>Therefore, most Japanese people think that "amato" means people who like sweets, and "karato" means people who like spicy food literary.<br/><br/>However, the original meanings are something like the following:<br/><br/>Amato: People who prefer sweets than sake (alcohol).<br/><br/>Karato: People who prefer sake (alcohol) to sweets.<br/><br/>The meaning of "amato" is almost correct, but that of "karato" is dramatically different from the original.<br/><br/>One of the most widely-accepted theories that explain why "karato" means people who like sake is that high alcohol sake that have a low sugar content is called "辛い" (spicy) in Japan.

甘党と辛党<br/><br/>今日は、多くの日本人が誤用している日本語、「甘党」と「辛党」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「甘」は「sweet」、「辛」は「spicy」、「党」は「party」を意味します。<br/><br/>このため、文字から「甘党」は「甘いものが好きな人」、「辛党」は「辛いものが好きな人」と考えられていることが多いです。<br/><br/>しかし、本来の意味は、それぞれ以下のようになります。<br/><br/>甘党：酒よりも甘い菓子類が好きな人<br/><br/>辛党：甘い菓子類よりも酒が好きな人<br/><br/>「甘党」の意味はおおよそ正しいですが、「辛党」の意味は大きく異なります。<br/><br/>「辛党」が「酒好き」を意味する有力な説の一つに、アルコール度数の高い酒（糖分の少ない酒）を日本では「辛い」と言うから、というものがあります。

Thank you so much for the corrections and explanations!<br/><br/>日本には「甘辛い」という言葉もあるので、Kiwiさんは「甘辛党」かもしれませんね（笑）<br/>Since there is the word "甘辛い (amakarai)" in Japan, Kiwi-san might belong to a faction of "amakarato," haha.
