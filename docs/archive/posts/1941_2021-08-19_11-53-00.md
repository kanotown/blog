<strong><em>Tayori no Nai no wa Yoi Tayori</strong></em><br/><br/>Recently, I haven't been in touch with my sister and brother.<br/><br/>They haven't sent me any messages either, but this fact implies that both we are living safely with no problems.<br/><br/>If you have not heard from someone but want to be relieved by this way of thinking,  you can use the saying <strong><em>tayori no nai no wa yoi tayori</em></strong> (便りの無いのは良い便り).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>tayori</em></strong> (便り) means "letter," <strong><em>nai</em></strong> (無い) means "no/nothing," and <strong><em>yoi</em></strong> (良い) means "good," the literal meaning of <em>tayori no nai no wa yoi tayori</em> is "no letter is a good letter."<br/><br/>This saying is thought to have come from the English saying "No news is good news."

便りの無いのは良い便り<br/><br/>最近、私は兄弟とあまり連絡をとっていません。<br/><br/>連絡がないということは、何事もなく無事に過ごしていると考えることもできます。<br/><br/>このように、連絡がないときに安心できることわざに「便りの無いのは良い便り」があります。<br/><br/>「便り」は "letter"、「無い」は "no/nothing"、「良い」は "good" を意味するので、「便りの無いのは良い便り」の意味は文字どおり "no letter is a good letter" となります。<br/><br/>このことわざは、英語のことわざ "No news is good news" に由来するものと考えられています。

If you haven't heard from someone in a while you can use the phrase 'tayori no nai no wa yoi tayori' (便りの無いのは良い便り) to feel a little better about it.

Thank you for the correction!<br/><br/>&gt; Letter doesn't sound right here but eh, it's literal.<br/>To tell you the truth, 'tayori' can also mean "news," so I would like to change the text here as follows:<br/>Since 'tayori' (便り) means "letter/news," 'nai' (無い) means "no/nothing," and 'yoi' (良い) means "good," 'tayori no nai no wa yoi tayori' literally means "no news is good news."
