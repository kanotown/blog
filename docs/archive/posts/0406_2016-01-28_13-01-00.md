日本語で「now I understand」を表現する方法<br/><br/>Lang-8で日本語の添削をしていると、たまに「今理解できます」「今わかります」といった表現を見ます。<br/><br/>これらは「now I understand」を直訳したものだと思いますが、少し不自然です。<br/><br/>今日は、「now I understand」を日本語でどう表現するかを紹介します。<br/><br/>まず、日本語では「理解した瞬間」を表すことが多いので、こういう場合は通常過去形を使います。<br/><br/>つまり、「今理解できました」「今わかりました」のようにします。<br/><br/>これで一応は自然な日本語ですが、「今」という言葉は「今この瞬間」というニュアンスが強いので、過去形とはあまり相性が良くありません。<br/><br/>個人的には、「今」を使わずに以下のような表現にすることで、より自然になると思います。<br/><br/>・やっとわかりました（理解できました）。<br/>・ようやく納得できました。<br/>・なるほど、そういうことですか。

"Grammatically correct" is exactly the word you want to use here. I'm disappointed that I didn't use it myself in my correction of this sentence.

 Like you I see this problem often with learners of Japanese so it's good for you to write about the topic. Your English is excellent and I only had to make a few corrections although they could use a bit more finesse to sound more natural. Best of luck!
