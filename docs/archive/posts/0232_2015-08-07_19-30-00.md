<h1 id="subject_show">The Deadline for Proceedings</h1>
<div class="date">Aug 7, 2015 19:30</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today was the deadline for proceedings submission of an academic conference.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I had not gotten any good experimental result.<br/><br/>Therefore, I worked all through the last night, but the result did not change.<br/><br/>I gave up and submitted the discontented paper.<br/><br/>Hehehe, I'm feeling a very weird sensation.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether the reason why is attributable to my own disappointment or lack of sleep or energy drink.<br/><br/>Anyway, good night!
