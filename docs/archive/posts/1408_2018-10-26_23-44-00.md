ウニ<br/><br/>昨日は「ハリセンボン」という生き物について書きました。<br/><br/>今日は、ハリセンボンと同じように多くの棘を持つ「ウニ」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ウニ」は漢字で「海胆」や「海栗」と書きます。<br/><br/>「海」は "sea," 「胆」 "organ," 栗は "chestnut" を意味します。<br/><br/>ウニの実が「胆」に見えることや、ウニの外形が「栗」のように見えることに由来します。<br/><br/>ちなみに、ある水族館でムラサキウニの棘の数を数えたところ、2850本あったそうです。

<li class="corrected correct">
Today, I would like to talk about 'uni' (ウニ), which has many spines as well as porcupinefish.
<p class="correction_comment">This sentence means that the uni has spines and a porcupinefish.<br/><br/>I think you mean that<br/>"The uni has many spines like a porcupinefish."<br/>or<br/>"The uni has many spines similar to a porcupinefish."</p>

<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">'Uni' is known as "sea urchin" in English, and it can be written as 海胆 or 海栗 in kanji.</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
'Uni' is known as "sea urchin" in English, and it can be written as <span class="f_blue">either </span>海胆 or 海栗 in kanji.
<p class="correction_comment">"Either" is optional. Your sentence is good. But since there are two options for how to write this kanji "either" sounds natural.</p>

<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">This is because the shucked sea urchin looks like "organ" and the outer shape of sea urchin looks like "chestnut."</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
This is because the shucked sea urchin looks like <span class="f_red">an </span>"organ" and the outer shape of <span class="f_red">the </span>sea urchin looks like <span class="f_red">a </span>"chestnut."

Incidentally, according to <span class="sline"><span class="f_red">the </span></span><span class="f_blue">a</span> survey of an aquarium, the number of spines of a purple sea urchin was 2850.
<p class="correction_comment">There are many surveys in the world. I don't know which one you mean yet, so I would say "a."<br/><br/><br/>Example:<br/>"In a survey there was a sea urchin with 2850 spines."<br/>vs.<br/>"I read an aquarium survey. In the survey there was a sea urchin with 2850 spines."</p>
