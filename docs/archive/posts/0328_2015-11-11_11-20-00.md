習慣化<br/><br/>先月の投稿で、3週間続ければ習慣化するということを書きました。<br/><br/>しかし、習慣化に要する時間は何をするかにもよるそうです。<br/><br/>例えば、読書や日記のような習慣は、1か月程度だそうです。<br/><br/>早起きや筋トレ、禁煙などの習慣は、3か月程かかるそうです。<br/><br/>そして、プラス思考や論理的思考など、思考の習慣は6か月程かかるそうです。

 Habits are so important I cannot even stress it out. Everything that is about us is a result of our habits they say. For example, I used to have a normal and healthy weight but I have bad eating habits. Right now, instead of grabbing snacks when I am bored, I drink a glass of water. It curbs my appetite which aids me in getting my health back.

 習慣化は大切なものですね〜　全ての私は習慣化の結果です。笑　最近、習慣化のことが興味があるので、この投稿を見てワクワクになちゃって

Thank you very much for the corrections!:D<br/>Yes, I also think habits are very important, but it's difficult to keep doing(or stopping) something. As one of the ways to build habits, I heard it's good to declare what you try to do to your friends. :)

ちょっと遅いけど…Haha, yes! Telling a friend your habits and asking them to be your reminder makes you keep going I heard. Other people do this.<br/><br/>Today I cheated my Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday exercise exercise days habit I started 2 months ago. I feel so tired and stressed out I didn't do anything today. Sometimes things just make it difficult to happen but I guess it just happens. I just have to keep moving on and do it. 明日、必ず運動するつもり！！！笑<br/>
