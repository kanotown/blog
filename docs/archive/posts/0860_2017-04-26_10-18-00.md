# Risks of Getting Up Early
<div class="date">Apr 26, 2017 10:18</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There is a proverb, "hayaoki wa sanmon no toku," in Japan.<br/><br/>"Hayaoki" means "getting up early," "sanmon" means "three cheap coins," and "toku" means "benefit."<br/><br/>That is to say, this proverb says that you should get up early because you can get somewhat benefit at least.<br/><br/>However, according to a recent study conducted by Dr. Kelley at Oxford University, getting up early could rise risks of various diseases and decline work performances.<br/><br/>Demonstration experiments conducted at Harvard University and Nevada University imply the correctness of this theory.<br/><br/>Since I wake up at around 5 a.m. recently, I start my work before 7 a.m., but I may have to go to bed late and get up late for health.

早起きのリスク<br/><br/>日本には「早起きは三文の徳」ということわざがあります。<br/><br/>「三文」とは一文銭（最低額の貨幣）三枚のことで、ごくわずかであることを意味します。<br/><br/>すなわちこのことわざは、少なからず徳（得）があるので、早起きをすべきだということを言っています。<br/><br/>しかし、最近オクスフォード大学のケリー博士により行われた研究によると、早起きはさまざまな病気のリスクを高め、仕事のパフォーマンスも低下させるそうです。<br/><br/>ハーバード大学やネバダ大学で行われた実証実験が、この説の正しさを裏付けています。<br/><br/>最近私は朝5時頃に目が覚めるので、7時前から仕事を開始していましたが、もう少し遅寝遅起をしようと思います。

 The American version is: "The early bird catches the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese." The first mouse got caught in a trap and died. Let's be the second mouse!

<li class="corrected correct">
That is to say, this proverb says that you should get up early because you can get some benefit.
<p class="correction_comment">Maybe it makes more sense to say "you can always get some benefit," but I'm not sure what you meant...</p>

<li class="incorrect">However, according to a recent study conducted by Dr.</li>

<li class="incorrect">Kelley at Oxford University, getting up early could rise risks of various diseases and decline work performances.</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
Kelley at Oxford University, getting up early could raise the risk of various diseases and cause a decline in work performance.
<p class="correction_comment">If something is acting on something else and causing it to rise, the verb is "raise," not rise. <br/>"Performance" in this context is with regard to work, so it's not plural.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">Demonstration experiments conducted at Harvard University and Nevada University imply the correctness of this theory.</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
Experiments conducted at Harvard University and Nevada University suggest the correctness of this theory.
<p class="correction_comment">"suggest" makes more sense here. Also demonstration experiments is correct, but sounds awkward and is not a phrase in common use to my knowledge.</p>

<li class="corrected correct">
Since I wake up at around 5 a.m. recently, I start my work before 7 a.m., but I may have to go to bed late and get up late for health.
<p class="correction_comment">I'm not sure exactly what you were trying to say. If you mean you adjust your own work schedule, then maybe, "Since I've been waking up around 5 a.m. recently, I've been starting work before 7, but I may have to start going to bet late and getting up late for my own health.</p>
