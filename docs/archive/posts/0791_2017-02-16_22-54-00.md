Today I will talk about the Japanese term "kattarui."<br/><br/>"Kattarui" means "to feel sluggish" or "to feel lazy."<br/><br/>This word was derived from "kahina dayushi," which is a word used in Heian Era.<br/><br/>"Kahina" of "kahina dayushi" means "arm," and "dayushi" means "to feel sluggish."<br/><br/>The word "kahina dayushi" changed to "kahidarushi," "kahidarui," then "kattarui."<br/><br/>That is to say, "kattarui" originally meant "to feel sluggish/lazy because of tired arms."<br/><br/>It came to mean not only "arm" but also "body," and finally it came to have the above meanings.<br/><br/>Incidentally, my dictionary says that "kattarui" can be translated into just "tiring."

かったるい<br/><br/>今日は「かったるい」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「かったるい」は、「体が疲れてだるい」ことや「面倒くさい」ことを表す言葉です。<br/><br/>この言葉は、平安時代の「カヒナダユシ」に由来します。<br/><br/>「カヒナ（かいな）」は「腕」を、「ダユシ」は「だるい」を意味します。<br/><br/>この「カヒナダユシ」は「カヒダルシ」となり、「カヒダルイ」、「かったるい」と変化してきました。<br/><br/>つまり、元々この言葉は、「腕が疲れてだるい」という意味を持っていました。<br/><br/>それが、腕だけでなく体も意味するようになり、現在のような「面倒くさい」という意味も持つようになりました。<br/><br/>ちなみに、私の辞書は「かったるい」を単に "tiring" と訳しています。

Thank you so much always for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; I had to reread this a few times to understand what was being said. I would consider reworking it so that it is easier to understand.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, actually I omitted a lot of detail information there. This sentence would be difficult to understand even in Japanese.
