今日は、「不思議の国のグプタ」という本を読みました。<br/><br/>この本は、TOEICテストの世界に住むインド人のグプタが、様々なことに気が付いていくお話です。<br/><br/>私は何度かTOEICテストを受験していたため、「あーあるある！」と思うようなことが多く、とても楽しめました。<br/><br/>例えば、TOEICの世界では次のような法則があります。<br/><br/>1.  飛行機は必ず遅れます。<br/><br/>2. コピー機は必ず故障するか、紙が無くなります。<br/><br/>3. 歯医者の予約は、必ず変更させられます。<br/><br/>4. インド人の名前はグプタかシンです。<br/><br/><br/>その他にもこの世界には様々な法則が存在しています。<br/><br/>こうして見ると、確かにTOEICの世界は不思議な世界だなと実感しました。<br/><br/>こういった法則を知ると、今後TOEICテストを受けるのが、少し楽しくなると思います。

Thank you so much for your correction!! (^-^)<br/><br/>However, It's a bit difficult for me to understand the difference between "certainly quite strange" and "strange certainly"(Is the important thing the position of "certainly"?).<br/>I think maybe you're right;<br/>I wanted to say "the world is certainly the wonderland (just as this book's title) ".

Thank you very much for your correction!! (^-^)<br/><br/>I wanted to say "It happens all the time in the TOEIC world" or "It's common occurrence in the TOEIC world" when I read the laws of the TOEIC world written in the book.<br/>I wonder if I can convey my thoughts to you.<br/>I'll try to improve my English!
