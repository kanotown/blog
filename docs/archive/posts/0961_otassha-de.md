# 【No. 0961】<strong><em>Otassha De</em></strong> (お達者で - Look After Yourself)
<div class="date">Aug 5, 2017 15:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I think that there are various parting greetings in many countries.<br/><br/>The most common one in Japan is "sayōnara" (さようなら - goodbye), but we often say "ogenki de" (お元気で) or "otassha de" (お達者で) for a person who will not meet with us for a long time.<br/><br/>Here, "genki" means that your body condition is good, and "tassha" means that your body is strong.<br/><br/>That is to say, both "ogenki de" and "otassha de" are a phrase that is used to wish for someone's health.<br/>(The "de" here means something like "please be ...")<br/><br/>I like the phrase "otassha de," but nowadays, it's rarely used by young people.

お達者で<br/><br/>別れの挨拶は、あらゆる言語でさまざまなものがあると思います。<br/><br/>日本語では「さようなら」が最も一般的ですが、長い間会わなくなる相手に対しては、「お元気で」で「お達者で」と言うことがあります。<br/><br/>「元気」は「体の調子が良いこと」を、「達者」は「身体が丈夫なこと」を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち、「お元気で」と「お達者で」は、いずれも相手の健康を願った言葉ということです。<br/><br/>私は「お達者で」という言葉が好きですが、最近の若者にはあまり使われなくなってきました。

<p class="correction_comment">This is OK, but you don't have to say "I think". This is a simple fact, right? You can just say "There are various parting greetings in many countries."<br/><br/>Also, in this sentence, I think it sounds more natural to not use "that". It's not wrong, though.</p>
