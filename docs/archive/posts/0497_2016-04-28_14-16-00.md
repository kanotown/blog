逆さ虹<br/><br/>今日は、逆さ虹について話します。<br/><br/>逆さ虹は、逆さ向きの虹が現れる自然現象です。<br/><br/>科学的には、環天頂アークと呼ばれます。<br/><br/>この虹は、太陽の上方に天頂を中心とした円弧を形成し、太陽側が赤、天頂側が紫となっています。<br/><br/>大気中の氷の粒で太陽光が屈折することで、発生します。<br/><br/>ただし、太陽高度が32度以下、雲の中に六角板状の氷晶がある、氷晶が底面を水平に落下姿勢を保つ、風が弱い、などの条件が必要です。<br/><br/>条件は厳しいですが、一度は見てみたいです。

 First time hearing of it. I am glad Science has been able to record a lot of unusual phenomenon.

Thank you very much always for correcting my post!<br/>Yes, a lot of unusual phenomena have been recorded, and many of their mechanisms have been revealed. They're interesting :)
