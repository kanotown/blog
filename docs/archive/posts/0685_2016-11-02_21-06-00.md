鉄板<br/><br/>今日は、日本のスラング「鉄板」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「鉄板」は文字通り「鉄の板」という意味も持ちますが、「間違いない」「確実な」という形容詞的な意味も持ちます。<br/><br/>例えば「鉄板ギャグ」と言うと、「絶対に笑いがとれる安定したギャグ」という意味になります。<br/><br/>語源はシンプルで、鉄板は硬いというイメージから来ています。<br/><br/>このスラングはギャンブルの世界で昭和中期頃から使われていました。<br/><br/>例えば競馬で「鉄板レース」と言うと、レートは低いけど当たる確率が高い手堅いレースという意味になります。<br/><br/>しかし近年では、お笑い芸人を通じて世間一般に広く浸透しています。

Good job! I like to learn about etymology. :)<br/><br/>By the way, is horse racing popular in Japan? I often hear Japanese people mention it.
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
Thank you very much for correcting my post again! :)<br/>Many Japanese people think that gambles such as horse race and pachinko (Japanese pinball) are not good hobbies.
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name"></span><br>
Yes, Americans look down on gambling, too, but I don't think horse racing is very common here! So I am surprised to hear Japanese people mention it often.

Oh! Although I wrote the following sentence, I forgot to insert it to my comment.<br/>"Horse racing is well-known in Japan because of Japanese TV news programs, but I think that it's popular among only a part of elderly men. "<br/><br/>Yes, unfortunately Japanese people might mention it often. I think that one of the reasons is because private gambling is forbidden in Japan and there are no casinos. Actually, horse racing is run by government or municipal organizations.
