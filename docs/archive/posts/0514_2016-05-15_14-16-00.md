# I Was Rained
<div class="date">May 15, 2016 14:16</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about a Japanese unique expression "adversative passive."<br/><br/>In Japanese, when you suffer inconvenience, you sometimes use intransitive verbs as passive forms.<br/><br/>For example, you can say "I was rained (雨に降られた)" instead of "It rained (雨が降った)."<br/><br/>By using such an expression, you can imply that you suffer inconvenience from the rain.<br/><br/>In addition, you can say something like "犯人に逃げられた, I was fled by the criminal (the criminal fled)," and "夫に死なれた, I was died by my husband (my husband died)."

雨に降られる<br/><br/>今日は、日本語の独特の言い回しである「迷惑の受け身」を紹介します。<br/><br/>日本語では、迷惑を被るような場合、自動詞を受け身で使うことがあります。<br/><br/>例えば、「雨が降る」を「雨に降られる」のようにして使います。<br/><br/>このような表現を使うことで、雨が降ることが迷惑であるということを、暗に伝えることができます。<br/><br/>他にも、「犯人に逃げられた（犯人が逃げた）」「夫に死なれた（夫が死んだ）」のように使うことができます。

<p class="correction_comment">Unfortunately for everyone learning, English has a pretty strict adjective order. This is what Google says it is:<br/><br/>Quantity or number.<br/>Quality or opinion.<br/>Size.<br/>Age.<br/>Shape.<br/>Color.<br/>Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)<br/>Purpose or qualifier.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>The other thing - an expression is a fixed phrase, e.g. "I have it up to here with X" (meaning I'm fed up with X). What you're talking about is a grammatical structure, since there isn't a fixed verb that goes with it, just a fixed structure.</p>

By using such an expression, you<span class="f_blue">'re implying</span> that you suffer<span class="f_blue">ed an</span> inconvenience from the rain.

<li class="incorrect">In addition, you can say something like "犯人に逃げられた, I was fled by the criminal (the criminal fled)," and "夫に死なれた, I was died by my husband (my husband died)."</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
<span class="f_blue">Other examples could be</span> "犯人に逃げられた, I was fled by the criminal (the criminal fled)," <span class="f_blue">or </span>"夫に死なれた, I was died by my husband (my husband died)."
