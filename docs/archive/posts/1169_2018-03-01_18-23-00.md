たわけ者<br/><br/>残念なことに、世の中には多くの「たわけ者」が存在します。<br/><br/>「たわけ者」は、愚かな人や、ふざけた人のことを指す言葉です。<br/><br/>「たわけ者」の「たわけ」は、ばかげたことやふざけたことをすることを意味する動詞「たわく」もしくは「たわける」を名詞化したもので、「者」は人を表します。<br/><br/>また、「たわけ」は「田分け」から来ているという説もあります。<br/><br/>「田」は "field," 「分け」は "to divide something" を意味するので、この漢字を使ったときの「田分け」の意味は "to divide fields" となります。<br/><br/>遺産相続の度に子どもに田畑を分け与えていくと、いずれ面積がどんどん狭くなり、少量の収穫しか得られず家系が衰退します。<br/><br/>そのようなことをするのは愚かであるというわけです。
