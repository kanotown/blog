昨日、パソコンを Windows 10 にアップデートしました。<br/><br/>現在のところ、特に不具合はありません。<br/><br/>一番気に入っているのは、仮想デスクトップの機能です。<br/><br/>Linux や Mac では以前からある機能ですが、ようやく Windows にも搭載されました。<br/><br/>複数の作業をするときに、とても便利です。<br/><br/>また、全体的に文字にアンチエイリアスがかかり、少し綺麗になりました。

 This was well-written! I am debating whether or not to update to Windows 10.

If you're on windows 8, you really should. If you're on 7, you might want to wait a bit. Some features like VPN, virtual machines, bluetooth, and touchpad controls have outdated drivers. If you're not using any of those features, I'd personally recommend upgrading. You get the cool metro styled applications in windowed mode and new features like the one kanotown described. There's also cortana, which may be a plus or minus depending on your stance on virtual assistants.

 I updated too and I've noticed nothing too glitchy . I don't use multiple screens so I don't see it as a plus for windows 10.

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>Windows 7や8で動くゲームの大半は、Windows 10でも動くようです。
