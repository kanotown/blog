# Ichijitsu Senshu
<div class="date">Mar 25, 2017 12:47</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the four-character idiom "一日千秋 (ichijitsu senshu)."<br/><br/>"Ichijitsu senshu" means that you can't wait to something and feel like a long time.<br/><br/>The "ichijitsu" of "ichijitsu senshu" means "a day," abd the "senshu" means "a thousand autumn," that is, this idiom implies that you feel as if a day is a thousand year.<br/><br/>The reason why "autumn" is used rather than "spring" or "winter" is because "autumn" is the harvest season, and the kanji character could mean time/term. <br/><br/>Incidentally, this was derived from the Chinese idiom "一日三秋 (ichijitsu sanshu)," which has the same meaning.<br/>(Where "sanshu" means "three autumn.")

一日千秋<br/><br/>今日は「一日千秋」という四字熟語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「一日千秋」は、何かがとても楽しみで、一日がとても長く感じられることを表します。<br/><br/>「千秋」は「千回の秋」すなわち「千年」を意味し、「一日千秋」は「一日が千年のように長く感じられる」という意味になります。<br/><br/>「春」や「冬」ではなく「秋」が使われている理由は、「秋」は収穫の季節であり、「とき」を表す言葉でもあるからです。<br/><br/>この言葉は、同じ意味を持つ中国の「一日三秋」から派生しました。

 Interesting as always ^^ Do you usually use this idiom in your daily life?

Thank you very much for your corrections! (^^)<br/>&gt; Do you usually use this idiom in your daily life?<br/>Actually, I rarely hear this idiom. This is very formal and a kind of expression of novels. However, if you say it as 「一日千秋の思いです」 in a conversation, I think it's really cool :)
