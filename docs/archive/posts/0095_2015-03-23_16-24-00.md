日本では、男性の5％、女性の0.2％が色覚異常を持っていると言われています。<br/><br/>今日、私は以下のサイトで、色彩感覚をテストしてみました。<br/><br/><a href="http://www.xrite.com/online-color-test-challenge" target="_blank">http://www.xrite.com/online-color-test-challenge</a><br/><br/>テストは単純で、色相が順に変化していくように、ボックスを並び替えるというものです。<br/><br/>結果は運良く満点でした。<br/><br/>私はとても嬉しかったのですが、ネットで調べてみると、結構満点をとっている人が多かったので、簡単なテストだったようです。
