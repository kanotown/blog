<p class="correction_comment">Most of the shows you've listed are comedies, not dramas.<br/><br/>"Drama" has many different meanings:<br/>a dramatic TV program <br/>a dramatic play<br/>a dramatic movie<br/>a dramatic real-life event, such as the election of Donald Trump as president, or the nuclear bomb testing in North Korea<br/><br/>Therefore, in your original sentence, "American dramas" could mean any of the above. To avoid confusion, I suggest you use "American TV series" or "American TV programs" instead of "dramas."</p>

<p class="correction_comment">Sentence is fine Just an observation. <br/><br/>Since you pointed out that 1000 is a round figure I call your current entry. 1001, a "bookends" figure.

On (this - Yours makes perfect sense and is perfectly fine but it makes for a rather uncommon thought/expression. I actually like including "this." ) Lang-8, I've written about Japanese idioms, Japanese culture, and trivial everyday matters.

Thank you so much always for correcting me! :)<br/>&gt; Since you pointed out that 1000 is a round figure I call your current entry. 1001, a "bookends" figure. Since you seem to like numbers, 1001, in binary, is the same as 9 in base-10. Does 9 happen to be significant too? 'o)<br/><br/>Oh, it's a really interesting viewpoint. Unfortunately, since 9 can be read as "ku" (苦 - suffering), it's often avoided in Japan, haha. Also, 4 is also avoided, because it can be read as "shi" (死 - death).<br/><br/>&gt; Every day I've written about a Japanese idiom, culture, or trivial matter.<br/><br/>I think that this is fine.<br/>I sometimes wrote in the middle of the night, and sometimes wrote early in the morning, and sometimes forgot to post, but I've written English sentences every day since 1000 days ago :)<br/><br/>&gt; You THINK that you've watched.... hmm?<br/>Sorry, it might be difficult to understand my thought from this sentence.<br/><br/>I used the verb "think" toward "a lot of."<br/>That is, I wanted to say something like:<br/>I think that the number of dramas/TV series I watched is large, but other people may not think so.<br/><br/>&gt; It's fine... except you're missing Killjoys, Battlestar Galactica, Channel Zero, Dark Matter, Killjoys, Expanse, The Magicians, and Stranger Things (Netflix) just to mention a few. ;o)<br/><br/>Thank you for the recommendation!<br/>I actually watched Stranger Things, but I've not watched the others yet. I could find "Killjoys" and "Expanse" on Netflix in Japan, I will watch them in the near future :)<br/><br/>&gt; It seems that Japanese speakers tend to write like you have. It's not wrong but it takes an indirect path to express something.<br/><br/>You means that people should not aim for just a job title, don't you? If so, I also think so. My essential motivation is that I'd like to develop new technology that can help/save people as a researcher, and be happy by receiving compliments.
