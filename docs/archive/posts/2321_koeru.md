# 【No. 2321】<strong><em>Koeru</em></strong> (肥える - Gaining Weight): Part 2
<div class="date">Feb 28, 2024 18:51</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Koeru</em></strong>: Part 2<br/><br/>When the verb <strong><em>koeru</em></strong> (肥える - "to gain weight") is used in relation to specific organs of the human body, it means to become rich in one's ability to discern the quality of things.<br/><br/>For example, when used with <strong><em>me</em></strong> (目 - "eye") and saying <strong><em>me ga koeru</em></strong> (目が肥える), it means to gain the ability to distinguish between good and bad works by seeing many excellent works of art.<br/><br/>Similarly, when used with <strong><em>shita</em></strong> (舌 - "tongue") and saying <strong><em>shita ga koeru</em></strong> (舌が肥える), it means to become able to discern subtle differences in flavors by tasting various delicious dishes.<br/><br/>Both cases imply that one's sense has been refined and can be used as a compliment.<br/><br/>However, please note that they can also be used sarcastically towards someone who has become unsatisfied with ordinary work or dishes.

肥える Part 2<br/><br/>「肥える」を人体の特定の器官に対して使うと、物事の良し悪しを感じ分ける力が豊かになるという意味になります。<br/><br/>例えば、「目」に対して使い、「目が肥える」と言うと、「優れた作品・美術品などを多く見て、その良し悪しを見分ける能力がつく」という意味になります。<br/><br/>また、「舌」に対して使い、「舌が肥える」と言うと、「さまざまな美味しいものを食べることで、細かい味の違いを感じ取ることができるようになる」という意味になります。<br/><br/>いずれも感覚が洗練されることを意味し、褒め言葉として使うことができます。<br/><br/>しかし、平凡な作品や料理に満足できなくなってしまった人に対し、皮肉を込めて使われることもあるので注意してください。
