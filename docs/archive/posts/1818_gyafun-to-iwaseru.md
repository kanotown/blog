ぎゃふんと言わせる<br/><br/>今日は、誰かを負かして悔しい思いをさせることを意味する「ぎゃふんと言わせる」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ぎゃふん」はやり込められて一言も言い返すことができないさまを意味する擬態語、「言わせる」は "making someone say' を意味するので、「ぎゃふんと言わせる」は上記のような意味を持つというわけです。<br/><br/>ここで「ぎゃ」は驚きの感嘆詞、「ふん」は「ふむ」と同じで納得の感動詞であると考えられています。

<p class="correction_comment">The English is totally fine in the original, but I'm not sure that "beat" and "frustrated" are quite right. To beat someone generally means to physically hit them (unless it's followed by "at" or something similar, such as "I beat him at tennis"). And frustrated seems a little too general here, they are frustrated, but my understanding is that the point is that they can't respond. There's an English expression "render someone speechless" which seems similar, so I've used it in my correction.</p>
