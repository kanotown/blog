<div class="date">Jan 6, 2017 21:13</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese slang "sukebe".<br/><br/>"Sukebe" means that something or someone is lascivious, and it is usually used to men.<br/><br/>It is said that this slang comes from the word 「助兵衛」 (sukebe), which was used in the Edo period.<br/><br/>It was originally written as "好兵衛" (sukibe), and meant a person who had a strong interest in something.<br/><br/>(「好き」 (suki) means "to like", and 「兵衛」 is a suffix that personifies verbs and nouns.)<br/><br/>Since 「助兵衛」 (sukebe) was very popular name in that age, 「好兵衛」 (sukibe) changed to 「助兵衛」, then it came to mean only lascivious things.

すけべ<br/><br/>今日は「すけべ」という日本の俗語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「すけべ」とは、好色であることや、好色な人を表す言葉で、主に男性に対して使用されます。<br/><br/>この言葉は、江戸時代に使われていた「助兵衛」から来ているとされています。<br/><br/>もともとは「好兵衛」と書き、何かに対して強い興味を示す人を指していました。<br/><br/>（「兵衛」は動詞や名詞を擬人化する接尾語です。）<br/><br/>当時、「助兵衛」という名前が一般的なものであったことからこのようになまり、現在のような意味に変わっていったようです。

<p class="comment_small">
 The word 'lascivious' is rarely used in English. I suggest changing it to libidinous or lustful.
