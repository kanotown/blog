<p class="correction_comment">Saying your holding a party sounds like you are the one in charge. Saying that you are having a party sounds like you are a part of it as well.</p>

 Congrats! ^^ What was your paper on?

Thank you so much for correcting me!<br/>My paper was about a new reconstruction algorithm for X-ray CT, and I submitted it to a Japanese academic journal. Someday, I want to be able to write English well and submit a paper to academic journals of English.

How cool! I hope you are able to submit an paper to an English journal, too. Then I can try to read your paper. :D<br/>Learning scientific terminology in a different language must be very difficult. It takes a lot of time for even native speakers to be able to understand papers. Once out of curiosity, I looked up "腫瘍抑制遺伝子" to see what Japanese academic language is like. It was really scary, haha.
