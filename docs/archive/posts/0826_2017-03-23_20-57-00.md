# 【No. 0826】Graduation Ceremony
<div class="date">Mar 23, 2017 20:57</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today a graduation ceremony took place at my university.<br/><br/>Students who would graduate were wearing hakama (Japanese skirts or culottes) or suits, and they looked excited.<br/><br/>The graduation ceremony ended in the morning, and the conferment of degree was conducted at each laboratory from the afternoon.<br/><br/>After that we took pictures with everybody, and each of us made some comments, then my boss and I presented memorabilia to the students. <br/><br/>I was about to cry due to the reaction of the students, but I bit the inside of my cheeks.<br/><br/>The day when students that I taught for one year as a teacher graduated and got out into the world was deeply emotional for me.

卒業式<br/><br/>今日は私の大学で卒業式が行われました。<br/><br/>卒業する生徒たちは、スーツや袴に身を包み、わくわくした顔つきをしていました。<br/><br/>午前中で式典が終わり、午後からは各研究室で学位記の授与が行われました。<br/><br/>その後全員で写真を撮り、ひとりひとりコメントをして、記念品の贈呈をしました。<br/><br/>学生につられて少し泣きそうになりましたが、堪えました。<br/><br/>教員として1年間教えてきた学生が、卒業して社会に出ていくこの日は、とても感慨深いものでした。

<p class="correction_comment">I think "because of" is more natural than "due to."<br/>There are many students so there are many reactions.<br/>I think there has to be a little more explanation as to why you bit the inside of your cheeks.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">堪える- to bear, to endure, to restrain<br/>So you could say: <br/><br/>I was about to cry due to the reactions of the students, but I endured/restrained the urge (to cry).</p>
