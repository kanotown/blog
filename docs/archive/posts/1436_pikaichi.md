<div class="date">Nov 23, 2018 19:40</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Pikaichi</em></strong><br/><br/>When describing something/someone that is the best among many things/people, you can use the Japanese <strong><em>pikaichi</em></strong> (ピカイチ).<br/><br/>This term comes from <strong><em>hana-awase</em></strong> (花合わせ), which is one of the ways of playing traditional Japanese card <strong><em>hanafuda</em></strong> (花札 - literally "flower cards").<br/><br/>There are mainly four types of cards in hanafuda: 1 point cards called <strong><em>kasu-fuda</em></strong> (カス札 - literally "garbage card"), 5 point cards, 10 point cards, and 20 point cards called <strong><em>hikari-fuda</em></strong> (光札 - literally "shining cards").<br/><br/>In the hana-awase, firstly seven cards are handed out to each participant.<br/><br/>At this time, when someone had six kasu-fudas and one hikari-fuda, it was called <strong><em>picaichi</em></strong> (ピカイチ - literally "one pika/hikari"), and it has come to have its current meaning.

ピカイチ<br/><br/>多くのものの中で、飛び抜けて優れていることを日本語で「ピカイチ」と言うことがあります。<br/><br/>この言葉は、日本の伝統的なカード「花札」の遊び方の一つ「花合わせ」に由来します。<br/><br/>花札には、1点のカス札、5点の札、10点の札、20点の光札が存在します。<br/><br/>そして花合わせは、最初に7枚の札が各参加者に配られます。<br/><br/>このとき、「カス札が6枚、光札が1枚」の状態であることを「ピカイチ」と呼び、現在の意味を持つようになったというわけです。
