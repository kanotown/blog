# Jibara wo Kiru
<div class="date">May 20, 2017 08:29</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese idiom "jibara wo kiru (自腹を切る)."<br/><br/>"Ji (自)" means yourself, "bara (腹)" means abdomen, and "kiru (切る)" means to cut something.<br/><br/>Therefore the literal meaning is "to cut your own abdomen," corresponding to "seppuku/harakiri," but it actually refers to spend your own money on something that you don't necessarily need to pay.<br/><br/>Here, "jibara (your abdomen)" and "kiru (to cut)" are metaphors for "your own money" and "to use," respectively.<br/><br/>In the past, Japanese samurai committed seppuku (cut their own abdomens) with firm resolve to accept the blame.<br/><br/>It might need firm resolve to spend your extra money.

自腹を切る<br/><br/>今日は「自腹を切る」という慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>「自腹を切る」は、本来出す必要のない経費などを、自分で支払うことを意味します。<br/><br/>ここで「自腹」は「自分のお金」を、「切る」は「使う」を比喩しています。<br/><br/>かつて日本の武士は、何らかの責任を取るために決死の覚悟で切腹をしました。<br/><br/>自腹を切ることは、切腹することのように決死の覚悟がいるということなのかもしれません。

Therefore the literal meaning is "to cut your own abdomen." This may appear to correspond to "seppuku/harakiri," but it actually refers to spending your own money on something that you don't necessarily need to pay.

<p class="correction_comment">Your sentence is fine.<br/><br/>Here "kiru" and "jibara" ("to cut" "your abdomen") are metaphors for "to use your own money."<br/><br/>What do you think of this sentence?</p>

You might need firm resolve to use your extra money to pay your debt.
<p class="correction_comment">It puzzled me when you wrote "resolve to spend" because spending implies that you're making a new purchase. I interpreted your previous comments  to mean that you should use your extra money to pay a debt that you might not need to pay. Am I close?</p>

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/><br/>&gt; Here "kiru" and "jibara" ("to cut" "your abdomen") are metaphors for "to use your own money."<br/> &gt; What do you think of this sentence?<br/>I've never seen such a style so I felt a little strange, but placing "to cut" and "your abdomen" in this order might be easier to understand for English speakers.

This idiom can use to a debt, but it also can use to various purchases.<br/><br/>For example, <br/>「会社の備品を自腹を切って買った。」<br/>"I bought office supplies with my own money / at my expense."<br/><br/>「自腹でパーティを開く。」<br/>"I will hold a party out of my own pocket."

&gt;&gt;I've never seen such a style so I felt a little strange, but placing "to cut" and "your abdomen" in this order might be easier to understand for English speakers.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a strange style, especially the part ("to cut" "your abdomen") because that is really ugly, so please don't use it. As far as the order of the terms go that's the order I'd present them because that's the natural order of an English sentence. However, that's not the order they are used in Japanese and your are explaining a Japanese idiom, right? You can make arguments for using either order. It's just a thought. <br/>

 is 'ji' also the kanji for white?

Thank you so much always for correcting my post! :)<br/>&gt; is 'ji' also the kanji for white?<br/>The kanji "自 (ji)" is really similar to "白 (shiro, haku)," which means "white," but the number of horizontal lines is different! Note that "ji" don't have the meaning as "white."
