<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Amayo no Tsuki</strong></em><br/><br/>Something that exists there but is not visible, or an imaginary thing that does not exist is sometimes described as <strong><em>amayo no tsuki</em></strong> (雨夜の月).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>ama/ame</em></strong> (雨) means "rain," <strong><em>yo</em></strong> (夜) means "night," and <strong><em>tsuki</em></strong> (月) means "moon," the literal meaning of <em>amayo no tsuki</em> is "moon on a rainy night."<br/><br/>This phrase was used in a poem of the <strong><em>Shika Wakashū</em></strong> (詞花和歌集 - "Collection of Verbal Flowers") written around 1151, as a metaphor for the moon hidden by clouds on a rainy night to a loved person one cannot meet, then it came to have the current meaning.<br/><br/>Sometimes it simply means "the harvest(full) moon which cannot be seen because of the rain."

雨夜の月<br/><br/>そこにあるのに目には見えないもの、または想像だけで実現しないもののことを、「雨夜の月」と言うことがあります。<br/><br/>「雨」は "rain"、「夜」は "night"、「月」は "moon" を意味するので、「雨夜の月」の文字通りの意味は "moon on a rainy night" となります。<br/><br/>この言葉は、1151年頃に書かれた詞花和歌集にある歌の一節において、夜の雨雲に隠れた月を会うことのできない想い人にたとえる形で使われ、現在の意味を持つようになりました。<br/><br/>「雨のため見ることのできない中秋の名月（満月）」の意味を持つこともあります。
