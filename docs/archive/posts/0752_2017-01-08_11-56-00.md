# 【No. 0752】<strong><em>Kokera Otoshi</strong></em> (Dropping Chips of Wood)
<div class="date">Jan 8, 2017 11:56</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese event called "kokera otoshi".<br/><br/>"Kokera otoshi" is the first event that is held in a newly constructed theater as part of the opening festivities.<br/><br/>"Kokera" means chips of wood that are produced when cutting timber, and "otoshi" means "to drop".<br/><br/>After building a wooden building, we first brush down "kokera" that are left on the roof.<br/><br/>From this fact, the event which will be held for the first time after the theater is constructed came to be referred to as "kokera otoshi".<br/><br/>By the way, "kokera" is written as "杮" in kanji.<br/><br/>This kanji is really similar to "柿" (kaki) (which means "persimmons"), but it's different at the right part -- the vertical bar is connected in "杮" (kokera), while it's separated in "柿" (kaki).

こけら落とし<br/><br/>今日は「こけら落とし」と呼ばれる催しを紹介します。<br/><br/>「こけら落とし」とは、新築された劇場などで初めて行われる催しです。<br/><br/>「こけら」は、「木のかけら」、すなわち木材を削ったときに出る切り屑を意味します。<br/><br/>木造の建物を建てたとき、最後に屋根に残った「こけら」を払い落とします。<br/><br/>このことから、劇場が完成して初めて行われる催しを「こけら落とし」と呼ぶようになりました。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「こけら」を漢字で書くと「杮」です。<br/><br/>果物の「柿」という漢字と非常によく似ていますが、つくりの縦棒が繋がっているかどうかが違います。
