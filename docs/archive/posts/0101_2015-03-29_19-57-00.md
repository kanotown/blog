不規則動詞<br/><br/>私は時々、英語の不規則動詞に悩まされます。<br/><br/>そもそも英語ができたばかりの頃は、ほとんどの動詞が不規則動詞でした。<br/><br/>これはこれで、ある種の規則があったと言えます。<br/><br/>しかし多くの戦争によって、様々な由来を持つ言葉が英語として使われるようになり、英語は単語も文法もどんどんいい加減になりました。<br/><br/>人々はこれらを整理するため、過去形・過去分詞系には [-ed] をつけるというルールを定め、結果として多くの不規則動詞が無くなりました。<br/><br/>現在、アメリカの高校で習う不規則動詞の数は、157個だそうです。<br/><br/>人間は物事を単純にする傾向があるので、将来的には多くの不規則動詞が無くなると言われています。<br/><br/>ちなみに、人工言語であるエスペラント語には不規則動詞が全く存在せず、世界一不規則動詞が少ない言語としてギネスブックに登録されています。

 I have never heard of Esperanto before so I did a little bit of research. It is supposed to be a  "politically neutral language that would transcend nationality and foster peace and international understanding between people with different languages". It sounds interesting! I wonder what it is about this language that is so special.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 How did you learn about this language?

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/>I'd like to be able to understand the English nuances someday.<br/><br/>&gt; How did you learn about this language?<br/>I heard about this language from my friend. I only know the name and some features about this. Of course, I couldn't understand Esperanto, but I have a little interest in it.
