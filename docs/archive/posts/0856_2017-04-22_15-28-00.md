<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Asameshi Mae</strong></em> (Before Breakfast)</h1>
<div class="date">Apr 22, 2017 15:28</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I'd like to talk about the Japanese term "asameshi mae."<br/><br/>"Asameshi" of "asameshi mae" means "breakfast," "mae" means "before."<br/><br/>This term sometimes means "before breakfast" literally, but it often means that it is quite easy to do something.<br/><br/>Since you are hungry and don't have much time before eating breakfast, you can only do simple tasks.<br/><br/>In particular, we had meals two times a day until the middle of the Edo period, so we couldn't bring out our real strengths before breakfast.<br/><br/>From this fact, "asameshi mae" (before breakfast) came to mean easy tasks that you can finish before you eat breakfast.

朝飯前<br/><br/>今日は「朝飯前」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「朝飯前」は、文字通り朝食の前の時間を表すことに加えて、何かをするのがきわめて簡単であることも意味します。<br/><br/>朝飯を食べる前は、空腹かつ時間も限られているため、簡単な仕事しかできません。<br/><br/>特に、日本は江戸時代中頃まで一日二食であったため、朝飯前には力が入りません。<br/><br/>このことから、「朝飯前」は「朝食を食べる前でも仕上げられる簡単な仕事」を意味するようになりました。
