心拍数の限界<br/><br/>心臓は生涯可能鼓動寿命と呼ばれるものがあり、これはおよそ15～20億回だと言われています。<br/><br/>実は哺乳類は体の大きさに関係なく、だいたい同じです。<br/><br/>寿命が異なるのは、心拍の速さに大きく影響しています。<br/><br/>私は1分間に70回ほどでしたので、心拍数の上限が20億回だとすると、寿命は56歳になります。<br/><br/>ちょっと怖くなりました。

<p class="correction_comment">Japanese is a little more flexible with making up nouns like this, but English not so much^^; The meaning is understood, but it sounds funny and "foreign."</p>

<p class="correction_comment">In the clause, "regardless of...," the noun actually becomes each individual mammal, so tense changes to singular.<br/><br/>"The police rounded up all the kids, regardless of their age and race."</p>

<p class="correction_comment">You could say "the," but you need to include whose life expectancy you are talking about: "The life expectancy of a mammal depends on their (average) beats per minute."</p>

I have a question. Can I rewrite this sentence as follows?<br/>Since my heart rate was 70 bpm, the length of my life will be around 56 years if the upper limit is 20 billion.

Looking back now, you should say "Since my heart rate is 70 BPM..." since we are talking about an on-going state (your heart beat continues to be 70 BPM).<br/><br/>「Since my heart rate is 70 BPM, the length of my life will be around 56 years if the upper limit is 20 billion. 」<br/>It sounds a little funny to put the condition AFTER the conclusion. You can do it, but it's not common because it sounds like an afterthought.<br/><br/>If you want to sound very advanced:<br/><br/>"Assuming that the upper limit is 20 billion, and given that my (average) heart rate is 70 BPM, the length of my life would be around 56 years."<br/><br/>"assuming" means something like "if this is true..."<br/>"given that" means something like "since this is true..."
