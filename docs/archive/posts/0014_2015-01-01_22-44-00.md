<p class="correction_comment">In English, "software" is an uncountable noun, so we cannot use "a/an", which is only for singular countable nouns. Note that in some other languages, "software" is a countable noun, such as Italian. This is why some foreign speakers incorrectly use "software" as a countable noun in English. (Hearing "a software" is actually very weird for long time English speakers, so it does matter a lot.) <br/><br/>We can also write "Creating Software for Improving My English". :)</p>
