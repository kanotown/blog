# 【No. 0979】<strong><em>Chacha wo Ireru</strong></em> (茶々を入れる - Teasing)
<div class="date">Aug 23, 2017 14:01</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Have you ever broken into a conversation of others, and said unnecessary things or cracks?<br/><br/>Such an act is called "chacha wo ireru" (茶々を入れる) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "chacha" (茶々) contains the kanji, "茶," which means "tea," but this idiom doesn't related to tea.<br/>(Incidentally, the kanji "々" means repetition the previous character.)<br/><br/>One of the most accepted theories about its etymology is that it's comes from "jaja" (邪邪).<br/><br/>"Jaja" meant to disturb someone or act spoiled, and the theory states that "jaja" has changed into "chacha."<br/>("Jaja" is no longer used.)

茶々を入れる<br/><br/>他人の会話に横から入り、余計なことや冷やかしを言ったことはありますか？<br/><br/>このような行為を、日本語では「茶々を入れる」と言います。<br/><br/>「茶々」には "tea" を意味する「茶」という字が使われていますが、「お茶」とは関係ありません。<br/><br/>語源に関する有力な説の一つは、「邪邪」から来ているというものです。<br/><br/>「邪邪」は「わがままを言うこと」や「邪魔をする」ことを意味し（現在では使われていません）、これが「茶々」に変化したということです。

 A few years ago there was a phone called HTC Chacha, I don't know if it was sold in Japan though.

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>I didn't know HTC Chacha. "Chacha wo ireru" has bad meaning, but  I think that most Japanese don't get bad impression just by watching "chacha," so it could be sold in Japan.

You're welcome!<br/><br/>&gt; "Chacha wo ireru" has bad meaning, but I think that most Japanese don't get bad &gt;impression just by watching "chacha," so it could be sold in Japan.<br/><br/>I could be mistaken but I think that qwerty-phones were never popular in Japan.
