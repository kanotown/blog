We purchased hors d'oeuvre at a Chinese restaurant, and alcohol at a <span class="f_blue">party store</span>.

Since I had to drive, I couldn't drink, but I <span class="f_blue">enjoyed</span> a hearty meal.
<p class="correction_comment">What you wrote is perfect on its own, but I wasn't sure if you meant that you made dinner or that you had a lot to eat (instead of drinking alcohol).</p>

<li class="corrected correct">
Now, I feel something <span class="f_blue">strange in</span> my stomach.
<p class="correction_comment">What you wrote is grammatically fine, but it means that something is directly on top of your stomach (like a sleeping dog or a blanket or something). Saying that you feel something in your stomach implies an internally felt sensation instead of an externally felt one. Again, I'm not sure if this is what you want to say, but here it is anyway.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">"Bottle shop" is actually correct (I had to look it up).  "Liquor store" is a more common term.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">You could say you ate one to make the sentence valid. Saying you made it is a bit off topic for the sentence. If you really made one, you could say this:<br/><br/>I made/prepared a hearty meal for the party. Since I had to drive, I couldn't drink.</p>
