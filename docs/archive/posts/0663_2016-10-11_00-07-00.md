灯台下暗し<br/><br/>今日は「灯台下暗し」という日本のことわざを紹介します。<br/><br/>「灯台下暗し」の文字通りの訳は "under the toudai is dark" であり、「身近なことはかえって気が付きにくい」ことを意味します。<br/><br/>「灯台」（「灯明台」とも）は、油を入れた皿を乗せて火をともす台のことで、かつて部屋を明るくするために使われていました。<br/><br/>周囲を明るくすることはできますが、台の下の部分は影になり、暗くなってしまいます。<br/><br/>こてが転じて、身近なことには気が付きにくいという意味で使われるようになりました。<br/><br/>また、同じような意味を持つことわざとして、「近くて見えぬは睫」があります。
