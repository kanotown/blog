# <strong><em>Tsura no Kawa ga Atsui</strong></em> (面の皮が厚い - Having a Thick Skin)
<div class="date">Jul 6, 2023 20:27</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Tsura no Kawa ga Atsui</strong></em><br/><br/>People who have no shame and are audacious are sometimes described as <strong><em>tsura no kawa ga atsui</em></strong> (面の皮が厚い) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>tsura</em></strong> (面) means "face," <strong><em>kawa</em></strong> (皮) means "skin," and <strong><em>atsui</em></strong> (厚い) means "thick," the literal meaning of this phrase is "having thick skin on one's face."<br/><br/>Shameless and audacious people do not change their facial expressions even when they are criticized.<br/><br/>In other words, if one has a thick-skinned face, their facial expressions become scarce, making them appear audacious and shameless.

面の皮が厚い<br/><br/>恥を恥と思わない、ずうずうしい人のことを、「面の皮が厚い」と形容することがあります。<br/><br/>「面」は "face"、「皮」は "skin"、「厚い」は "thick" を意味するので、「面の皮が厚い」の文字どおりの意味は "having thick skin on one's face" となります。<br/><br/>ずうずうしい人は、非難を受けても表情を変えません。<br/><br/>つまり、面の皮が厚ければ表情が乏しくなり、ずうずうしい人のようであるというわけです。
