<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Kilimanjaro is the 5,895-meter-height mountain located in the northeastern part of Tanzania, and is the highest free-standing mountain in the world. <br/><br/>This name is also famous as a coffee brand, and it is one of the most popular brands in Japan.<br/><br/>Japanese often call "Kilimanjaro" of coffee "キリマン(Kiliman)" in abbreviation, but this split way is wrong in a narrow sense.<br/><br/>"Kilima" in "Kilimanjaro" means "mountain" in Swahili, amd "njaro" means "shining white" in Chaga languages.<br/><br/>Therefore, we actually have to split "Kilimanjaro" as "Kilima-njaro(キリマ･ンジャロ)."

キリマンジャロ<br/><br/>キリマンジャロはタンザニア北東部に位置する標高 5,895 m の山で、山脈に属さない独立峰としては世界一の高さを誇ります。<br/><br/>コーヒーのブランド名としても有名で、日本では最も人気のあるコーヒーブランドの一つです。<br/><br/>日本人はよく、コーヒーの「キリマンジャロ」を省略して「キリマン」と呼びますが、この区切り方は間違っています。<br/><br/>「キリマンジャロ」の「キリマ」はスワヒリ語で「山」、「ンジャロ」はチャガ語で「白く輝く」という意味です。<br/><br/>そのため、本来は「キリマ・ンジャロ」と区切るのが正解です。

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/>&gt; Although I think both words come from Swahili/Kiswahili<br/>I found this information in Japanese Wikipedia, but I didn't know that it is one of hypotheses, I'm sorry. There seems to be many hypotheses about the etymology of kilimanjaro.
