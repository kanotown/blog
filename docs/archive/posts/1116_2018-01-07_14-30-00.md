# 【No. 1116】<strong><em>Tora no Ko</strong></em> (虎の子 - Precious Thing)
<div class="date">Jan 7, 2018 14:30</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Do you have any important things that you never want to let go?<br/><br/>Such things are called 虎の子 (tora no ko) in Japanese.<br/><br/>虎 (tora) means "tiger" and 子 (ko) means "child," so the literal meaning of the combination is "tiger's child."<br/><br/>This term comes from the fact that a mother tiger cherishes her child.<br/><br/>In fact, general feline animals nurture their children for three to six months after they were born, whereas tigers nurture their children for eighteen to twenty-four months.<br/><br/>Incidentally, "tra no ko" can refer to money that has been saved, and then it's translated as "nest egg" in English.

虎の子<br/><br/>大切にしていて、絶対に手放したくないものはありますか？<br/><br/>そのようなもののことを、日本語で「虎の子」と言うことがあります。<br/><br/>虎は "tiger," 子は "child" を意味するので、虎の子の文字通りの意味は "tiger's child" になります。<br/><br/>この言葉は、虎の母親が自分の子を手元で大切に育てる事実に由来します。<br/><br/>一般的なネコ科の動物は生後3～6ヵ月で親離れするのに対して、虎は生後18～24ヵ月だそうです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「虎の子」は将来のための貯蓄を意味することもあり、その際は "nest egg" などと訳されます。

This term comes from the fact that a mother tiger cherishes her cub.
<p class="correction_comment">Although "child" makes sense, technically a baby tiger is called a cub so if you want to be more correct you can use "cub" as well. :)</p>
