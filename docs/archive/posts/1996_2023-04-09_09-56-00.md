<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Shōnen Oi Yasuku Gaku Nari Gatashi</strong></em><br/><br/>There are several proverbs referring to the fact that time flies, in addition to <strong><em>kōin ya no gotoshi</em></strong> (光陰矢の如し), which was introduced in my post yesterday.<br/><br/>One of them is especially directed to young people is <strong><em>shōnen oi yasuku gaku nari gatashi</em></strong> (少年老い易く学成り難し).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>shōnen</em></strong> (少年) means "boy," <strong><em>oi</em></strong> (老い) means "to get old," <strong><em>yasuku</em></strong> (易く) means "easy," <strong><em>gaku</em></strong> (学) means "learning," <strong><em>nari</em></strong> (成り) means "to achieve," and <strong><em>gatashi</em></strong> (難し) means "difficult," the literal meaning of this proverb is "boys (and girls) get old easily, and it is difficult to achieve learning."<br/><br/>In other words, this proverb says, "You have to study hard while you are young so that you do not end up learning nothing."

少年老い易く学成り難し<br/><br/>時間が経つのが早いことを意味することわざは、昨日の投稿で紹介した「光陰矢の如し」のほかにも幾つかあります。<br/><br/>特に若い人に向けたことわざに、「少年老い易く学成り難し」があります。<br/><br/>「少年」は "boy"、「老い」は "to get old"、「易く」は "easy"、「学」は "learning"、「成り」は "to achieve"、「難し」は "difficult" を意味するので、このことわざは "boys (and girls) get old easily, and it is difficult to achieve learning" という意味になります。<br/><br/>すなわち、「時間が過ぎ去り何も学べず終わってしまわないよう、若いうちから勉学に励まなければならない」ということです。
