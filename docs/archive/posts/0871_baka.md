# 【No. 0871】<strong><em>Baka</em></strong> (Idiot)
<div class="date">May 7, 2017 10:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the word "baka."<br/><br/>"Baka" means a stupid thing/person or a person who has low intelligence.<br/><br/>This word is often used when you tease or flame someone.<br/><br/>There are several theories about the etymology of "bala," but the most widely accepted theory is something like the following:<br/><br/>"Baka" comes from "bakuka," which is a transcription of the Sanskrit word "moha," meaning "fool."<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is another theory: "baka" comes from "bakamono" ("mono" means "person"), and it comes from "wakamono," which means "young person."<br/><br/>Anyway, please be careful when using this word.

ばか<br/><br/>今日は「ばか」という単語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ばか」は、愚かなこと/人や、知能の働きが鈍いこと/人を意味します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、相手をからかったり、罵倒する際によく使われます。<br/><br/>語源は諸説ありますが、サンスクリット語で「愚か」を意味する "moha" の音写「莫迦（ばくか）」から来ている説が有力です。<br/><br/>その他にも、「若者」の頭の音が転じて「馬鹿者」になったという説などがあります。<br/><br/>いずれにしても、この言葉を使う際は注意して下さい。

Sorry, I misunderstood the meaning of "to flame."<br/>I wanted to say "～を罵倒する (bato suru) / 罵る (nonoshiru)," and according to my dictionary, it's "abuse someone," "curse at someone," "revile against someone," or "swear at someone."

Then "insult" is the right word in my opinion.

You probably used "flame" because of this:<br/><br/><a href="http://jisho.org/word/" target="_blank">http://jisho.org/word/</a>%E7%BD%B5%E5%80%92%E3%83%A1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB

Yes, according to my dictionary, "flame" has the meaning of "罵倒する" in electronic bulletin boards or e-mail.<br/>There was the following example sentence:<br/>Please don't flame me if you disagree with this
