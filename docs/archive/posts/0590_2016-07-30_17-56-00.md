<div class="date">Jul 30, 2016 17:56</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I was in a state of "seppa-tsumatta."<br/><br/>Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese phrase "seppa-tsumaru." <br/><br/>"Seppa" means thin oval metals that are put on both sides of Japanese sword guards, and .<br/><br/>if seppa get jammed (tsumaru), you can't unsheathe the sword. <br/><br/>If you seppa-tsumaru when you are put on the spot, you will be not able to escape, let alone fight.<br/><br/>Therefore, seppa-tsumaru means something like a state that there is an imminent threat, and you can't do anything against it.<br/><br/>Seppa-tsumaru is translated into "under the gun," "in crunch mode," or "in a pinch" in English.

切羽詰まる<br/><br/>昨日、私は「切羽詰まった」状態でした。<br/><br/>今日は、この「切羽詰まる」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「切羽」とは、日本刀のつばの両面に添える薄い楕円形の金物で、これが詰まると刀が抜けなくなります。<br/><br/>追い詰められたときに切羽が詰まると、逃げることも刀を抜いて戦うこともできなくなります。<br/><br/>このことから、「切羽詰まる」は「物事がさしせまって為す術がなくなる」というような意味になりました。<br/><br/>英語では "under the gun," "in crunch mode," "in a pinch" などと訳されます。
