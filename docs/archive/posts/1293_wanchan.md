# 【No. 1293】<strong><em>Wanchan</em></strong> (ワンチャン - Possibility)
<div class="date">Jul 3, 2018 20:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I wrote that I couldn't make a deadline for submission of manuscripts yesterday.<br/><br/>However, there seems to be <strong><em>wanchan</em></strong> (ワンチャン).<br/><br/><em>Wanchan</em> comes from the English "one chance," and it means "there is a chance/possibility."<br/><br/>Originally, <em>wanchan</em> was used as a term of mah-jong, but these days young people often use it in various situations.<br/><br/>Incidentally, when we say <em>wanchan</em> as the above meaning, we don't stress it on any syllable.<br/><br/>If you accent the first syllable or write it as ワンちゃん (here, chan is written with Hiragana), it means a puppy or a cute dog.

ワンチャン<br/><br/>昨日私は、原稿の締め切りに間に合わなかったと書きました。<br/><br/>しかし、「ワンチャン」ありそうです。<br/><br/>「ワンチャン」は英語の "one chance" からきており、「可能性がある」「チャンスがある」などの意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>もともと麻雀の用語として使われていたようですが、現在は若者の間でよく使われているのを耳にします。<br/><br/>ちなみに、上述の意味の 'wanchan' (ワンチャン) にはアクセントがありません。<br/><br/>もし 'wa' にアクセントを置いたり、「ワンちゃん」のように「ちゃん」をひらがなで書くと、子犬やかわいい犬を指す言葉になることに注意して下さい。

 So it's still possible for you to submit your manuscript?  Or was yesterday's deadline the 'wanchan'?
