# 【No. 1385】<strong><em>Soppo wo Muku</em></strong> (そっぽを向く - Looking Away)
<div class="date">Oct 3, 2018 22:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Soppo wo Muku</em></strong><br/><br/>To describe that someone looks away, refuses to see something, or becomes uncooperative, you can use the Japanese phrase <strong><em>soppo wo muku</em></strong> (そっぽを向く).<br/><br/><strong><em>Muku</em></strong> (向く) is a common Japanese term that means "to look toward," but <strong><em>soppo</em></strong> (そっぽ) is basically used only in this phrase.<br/><br/>Soppo is written as 外方 in kanji, and as these kanji characters imply, it means "another direction" or "outside direction."<br/><br/>That is to say, the literal meaning of <em>soppo wo muku</em> is "to look toward another/outside direction."

そっぽを向く<br/><br/>相手を見ずによその方を向くことや、協調しない態度をとることを「そっぽを向く」と言うことがあります。<br/><br/>「向く」は "to look toward" を意味する一般的な日本語ですが、「そっぽ」は基本的に「そっぽを向く」の表現の中でしか使われません。<br/><br/>「そっぽ」は漢字で「外方」と書き、漢字が意味するとおり、外の方向 ("another direction" or "outside direction") を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち「そっぽを向く」は、"to look toward another/outside direction" という意味となります。

 Really helpful as always! Thank you for writing these all the time. ^^
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Can I use it like that?
 <br/>
 隊長を逆らうように、彼が硬い目でそっぽを向いた。

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/><br/>&gt; 隊長を逆らうように、彼が硬い目でそっぽを向いた。<br/>Yes, you can use it something like that, but it will be better to modify several parts.<br/><br/>[Modification of Case Particle]<br/>隊長 'に' 逆らうように、彼 'は' 硬い目でそっぽを向いた。<br/><br/>[Modification of Expression]<br/>隊長に逆らうように、彼は '険しい' 目でそっぽを向いた。<br/><br/>The expression 硬い目 is rarely used. I think that 険しい目 (grim eye/hard stare) is more appropriate.
