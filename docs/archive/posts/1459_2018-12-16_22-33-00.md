見落とす/見逃す<br/><br/>今日、私は Lang-8 上で受けた添削を見直していました。<br/><br/>すると、約20個ほど、"Thank you" の返事をし忘れている添削がありました。<br/><br/>気が付いたものには返事をしましたが、遅くなってしまったことを申し訳なく思います。<br/><br/>このように、何かに気づかないでいることを日本語で「見落とす」もしくは「見逃す」と言います。<br/><br/>「見」は "look"、「落とす」は "drop"、「逃す」は "miss" を意味します。<br/><br/>「見落とす」と「見逃す」はどちらも同じ意味を持ちますが、「見逃す」は「見て見ぬふりをする」ことを意味することもできます。

 I also noticed I missed saying thank you on a correction, but it was from a year ago. I think it would be stranger if I thanked him now!
