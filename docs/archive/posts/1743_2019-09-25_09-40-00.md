<h1 id="subject_show">Umi no Sachi, Yama no Sachi (海の幸と山の幸) Part 1</h1>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Umi no Sachi, Yama no Sachi Part 1<br/><br/>Yesterday, I introduced some foods that are often eaten in fall/autumn in Japan.<br/><br/>In particular, something caught in the sea, such as saury, is called <strong><em>umi no sachi</em></strong> (海の幸), and something caught in mountains, such as chestnuts or mushrooms, is called <strong><em>yama no sachi</em></strong> (山の幸).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>umi</em></strong> (海) means "sea," <strong><em>yama</em></strong> (山) means "mountain," and <strong><em>sachi</em></strong> (幸) means "products," the literal meaning of <em>umi no sachi</em> and <em>yama no sachi</em> are "sea products" and "mountain products," respectively.<br/><br/>To be continued.

海の幸、山の幸 Part 1<br/><br/>昨日は秋によく食される幾つかの食材を紹介しました。<br/><br/>その中でも、サンマなどの海で捕れるものは「海の幸」、栗や松茸など山で採れるものは「山の幸」と称されることがあります。<br/><br/>「海」は "sea"、「山」は "mountain"、「幸」は "products" を意味するので、「海の幸」と「山の幸」の文字どおりの意味は "sea products" と "mountain products" になります。<br/><br/>続く

<p class="correction_comment">'Products' is not wrong. But maybe I would use 'produce(noun)' or 'harvest' , in reference to 'something caught in sea/mountains'.</p>
