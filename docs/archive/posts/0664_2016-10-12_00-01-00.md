Japanese children say "yubikiri genman uso tsuitara hari senbon nomasu" while crossing their little fingers when they make a promise.<br/><br/>In the case of adults, the phrase becomes just "yubikiri" or "yubikiri genman."<br/><br/>At one time, Japanese prostitutes cut off their fingers and present them for particular customers to prove their loves.<br/><br/>(It's said that there were many imitation fingers.)<br/><br/>Cutting off fingers (which is called "yubikiri" in Japan)  became widespread and the meaning changed to "to keep a promise."<br/><br/>Also, "genman" means "ten thousands fists," and "hari senbon nomasu" means "to make someone drink a thousand needles."<br/><br/>Japanese children say this phrase as they are singing, but the actual meaning is horrible: "If you tell a lie, I will cut off your little finger, fist you 10,000 times, and make you drink 1,000 needles."

指切りげんまん<br/><br/>日本の子どもたちは、誰かと約束をするとき、小指を交差させて「指切りげんまん嘘ついたら針千本呑ます」と言います。<br/><br/>大人の場合は、「指切り」もしくは「指切りげんまん」とだけ言います。<br/><br/>日本ではかつて、遊女が客に対する愛を証明したいとき、指を切って渡していたそうです。<br/><br/>（実際には模造品の指が出回っていたそうです。）<br/><br/>この指切りが一般にも広まり、約束を守るという意味に変化しました。<br/><br/>「げんまん（拳万）」は「一万回の拳」という意味で、「針千本呑ます」は「裁縫針を千本呑み込ませる」という意味です。<br/><br/>子どもたちは歌を歌うようにこの言葉を言いますが、嘘をついたら指を切って一万回殴って千本の針を呑ませるという恐ろしい意味を持っています。

 Very interesting, thank you for sharing. I think many children's song and rymes that are popular here have creepy origins too. "Rock-a-bye-baby" is a lullaby about a baby falling from a tree for example. And "Ring-around-the-rosie"is about a horrible, deadly plague. I wonder why there's so many grotesque children's songs and games, it's really weird.

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/>And thank you for letting me know the interesting example in English. There are also horrible traditional songs for children in Japan, it's indeed weird.

 In English, our guarantee goes like this: I cross my heart and hope to die, stick a needle in my eye.
