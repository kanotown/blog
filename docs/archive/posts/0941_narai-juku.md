奈良井宿<br/><br/>今日は休日だったので、友人達と長野県に行くことにしました。<br/>（我々は本当に長野が大好きです。）<br/><br/>もともとは登山に行く予定でしたが、天候があまり良くなかったので、奈良井宿という場所を訪れることにしました。<br/><br/>奈良井宿は、かつて多くの旅人で栄えた宿場町であり、現在も重要伝統的建造物群保存地区として、当時の町並みの残しています。<br/><br/>さまざまな木工品や漆器、地域の食品などのお店が立ち並び、とても楽しめました。<br/><br/>その後は、世界一標高が高い場所に位置する水族館、蓼科アミューズメント水族館に行きました。<br/><br/>淡水魚のみの水族館で、規模は大きくありませんでしたが、珍しい魚が多くて楽しかったです。<br/><br/>充実した一日でしたが、帰路はひどい渋滞で、ものすごく疲れました。
