# 【No. 0709】Trial Class
<div class="date">Nov 26, 2016 22:05</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I conducted a trial class for high school students entering to a university where I work.<br/><br/>The purpose of this class was letting them be used to a college life that will start from next year.<br/><br/>There was some trouble with equipment, but I managed finish the class.<br/><br/>I felt happy because all students were listening to my talk in a serious manner.<br/><br/>However, since their parents were also observing my class, I was a little nervous.<br/><br/>I'm concerned about the result of questionnaires about the class.<br/><br/>By the way, while I was working in a relaxed way after that, the gates of my university were closed, then I was confined.

模擬授業<br/><br/>今日は私の勤める大学に来年入ってくる高校生に向けて、模擬授業を行いました。<br/><br/>この模擬授業の目的は、来年から始まる大学生活に慣れてもらうことです。<br/><br/>少し機材のトラブルもありましたが、なんとか無事終わりました。<br/><br/>高校生たちは皆真面目に授業を聞いていてくれていたので、嬉しかったです。<br/><br/>ただ、彼らの親御さんたちも一緒に授業を見学されていたので、少し緊張しました。<br/><br/>授業に対するアンケートの結果が気になります。<br/><br/>ちなみに、模擬授業のあと大学でゆっくり仕事をしていたらいつの間にか門が閉まり、閉じ込められてしまいました。

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>Actually, I couldn't leave premises by my car, but I was able to go outside on foot. It took me about two hours to go home.
