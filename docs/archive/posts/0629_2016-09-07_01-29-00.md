<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Kami</strong></em> (God / Paper / Hair / Seasoning or Consideration)</h1>
<div class="date">Sep 7, 2016 01:29</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "kami", which has several meanings and kanji.<br/><br/>The most commonly used kanji for "kami" are "神" (God), "紙" (paper) and "髪" (hair).<br/><br/>Actually, only "神" has the different accent among the three kanji.<br/><br/>The primary accent of "神" is "か", while that of "紙" and "髪" is "み".<br/><br/>Therefore, it's easy to distinguish "神" in a conversation.<br/><br/>It's a little difficult to distinguish "紙" from "髪", but "髪" is often expressed as "髪の毛" (hair) for clarity.<br/><br/>By the way, although it's a little formal expression, "加味 (kami)" (seasoning/consideration) is also often used.<br/><br/>"加味" has the same primary accent as "神", but it's easy to distinguish between the two, because "加味" is normally used with "～する (suru)" (do something), just like "加味する."

かみ（神 / 紙 / 髪 / 加味）<br/><br/>今日は、複数の意味と漢字を持つ「かみ」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>良く使用される漢字は「神」「紙」「髪」です。<br/><br/>実はこの三つの中で、「神」だけが異なるアクセントを持ちます。<br/><br/>「神」は「か」にアクセントがあるのに対し、「紙」と「髪」は「み」にアクセントがあります。<br/><br/>従って、会話の中で「神」を識別するのは容易です。<br/><br/>「髪」と「紙」の区別は少し難しいですが、「髪」は「髪の毛」と表現されることが多いです。<br/><br/>また、少しフォーマルな表現ですが「加味」という漢字もよく使われます。<br/><br/>「加味」は「神」と同じアクセントを持ちますが、通常「～する」と繋げて「加味する」のように使用されるので、区別するのは容易です。

Thank you very much for the corrections and your comment! :)<br/><br/>&gt; Could you explain the "accent"?<br/>I used the "accent" to mean "stressed point" or "emphatic point".<br/><br/>&gt; I'm not 100% sure on the context, but could you explain the "(a) little formal expression"?<br/>Sorry, it's difficult to explain the detail for me. Actually, I wanted to say just something like "it's not casual (and is a bit formal)."<br/><br/>I hope my English made sense.

The "か" in "神" is accentuated, while in "紙" and "髪", it is the "み" that is stressed.
<p class="correction_comment">Ok so, "to accent" does mean "to emphasise". (I looked online and it might be UK English.)<br/><br/>However, when it comes to pronouncing words, I believe "to accentuate" or "to stress" is better.<br/><br/>I changed the whole sentence structure too.</p>
