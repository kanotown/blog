 I never understood why one's mother is called お袋。Is it because kangaroos raise their joeys in their pouches?

Thank you for the comment, Kiwi-san.<br/>I think that most Japanese people don't know the etymology. I talked about お袋 in the following entry. If you have time, please check it :)<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/72569617963816665032649022677124416558" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/72569617963816665032649022677124416558</a>

Thanks, but I don’t really believe it. Children carried in bags? No way

Sorry for my confusing English.<br/><br/>There are several theories about the reason why one's mother is called お袋.<br/>The first one is that mothers managed the property (money) with bags.<br/>The second one is that we grow up in our mother's bosom (here the bosom implies psychological one). Bosom is called 懐 (futokoro), and it changed to fukuro, and ofukuro.<br/>Also, there is another theory -- it comes from the fact that we called uterus ふくろ (fukuro).

 These ideas towards marriage seem a bit old fashioned, but the post was very interesting. I really like the term 堪忍袋. I don't think we have anything similar in English. We have some expressions for when you lose your patience like "the last straw".
