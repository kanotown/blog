# 【No. 1091】Superstition concerning Swallow
<div class="date">Dec 13, 2017 21:18</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are many superstitions in Japan.<br/><br/>Almost all of them have no scientific basis, but some have make sense.<br/><br/>For example, it is said that "It will rain if swallows fly at low altitude."<br/><br/>As a low pressure system approaches, small bugs/flies get less able to fly at high altitude, because moisture attaches to their wings.<br/><br/>Since these small bugs/flies are baits of swallows, when they fly at low altitude, swallows also fly low to catch them.<br/><br/>I heard that the rain forecast based on the behavior of swallows is reliable in many cases.

ツバメに関する迷信<br/><br/>日本には数多くの迷信・言い伝えが存在します。<br/><br/>その多くは科学的な根拠がありませんが、筋の通ったものもあります。<br/><br/>例えば、「ツバメが低く飛ぶと雨が降る」です。<br/><br/>低気圧が近づいて湿度が高くなると、小さな虫は水分が羽に付いて体が重くなり、高く飛ぶことができなくなります。<br/><br/>小さな虫はツバメの餌であるため、虫が低く飛ぶと、ツバメもそれを追って低く飛ぶことになります。<br/><br/>このツバメの行動に基づく雨の予報は、高確率で当たると聞きました。
