# 【No. 0326】Bought an Electronic Notebook
<div class="date">Nov 9, 2015 10:53</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I bought a gadget "Boogie Board Sync" created by KINGJIM.<br/><br/>This is a simple electronic notebook, and you can save what you wrote with one touch of a button.<br/><br/>Immediately I used it, then I found that it was a little difficult to read what I wrote on account of the contrast, but it was not a big problem.<br/><br/>However, after a short time, I noticed that the drawing color changed to dark blue on regions far from the center (especially on the upper part).<br/><br/>Since the background color of the board is black, the dark blue color is really hard to read.<br/><br/>Now, I'm making an inquiry to the company to see whether this is a specification or not.

昨日、私はキングジムの Boogie Board Sync というガジェットを買いました。<br/><br/>これはシンプルな電子ノートで、ワンタッチで書いたものを保存することができます。<br/><br/>早速使ってみるとコントラストが悪く、書いたものが読みづらかったですが、大きな問題ではありません。<br/><br/>しかししばらく使っていると、中心から遠い部分（特に上部分）で色が青黒くなることに気づきました。<br/><br/>黒い背景なので、とても読みづらいです。<br/><br/>私は今、これが仕様なのかどうか問い合わせをしています。

 I made these edits on my phone, so unfortunately no red/blue color coding -- sorry! None of your sentences are grammatically wrong, though. I just changed them to be more native-sounding.
