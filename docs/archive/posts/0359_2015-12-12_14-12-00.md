朝食は食べるべきか？<br/><br/>朝食については様々な議論がされていますが、結局はその人によります。<br/><br/>体が食事を完全に消化吸収するのには約18時間がかかるため、夜6時に夕食を食べた場合、次の食事は翌日の昼12時が良いと言われています。<br/><br/>しかし、もし朝にお腹が空いていたり、育ち盛りの年齢であれば、朝食は食べるべきだそうです。<br/><br/>一番良くないのは、お腹が空いていないのに朝食を無理にとることです。<br/><br/>無理に朝食をとると、排泄のための腸の働きが阻害されるだけでなく、満腹中枢が正常に機能しなくなり、太りやすくなるそうです。

 I'm always starving when I wake up, so I never skip breakfast. I usually only eat fruit or cereal though, so it's a nice healthy balance, haha.

Thank you very much for correcting my post!<br/>Sounds so healthy! I also almost always eat breakfast, but sometimes I eat too much and become sleepy.

 This was very interesting.  I hadn't heard the idea that one should wait so long before the next day's meal.  I am well aware that we shouldn't force ourselves to eat when we're not hungry though.
 <br/>
 It seems there are a lot of theories about the optimal meal schedule for maintaining healthy body weight.  I've heard that for the sake of maintaining higher metabolism, eating 4-5 smaller meals a day is better than 2-3 larger meals.  I don't strictly adhere to this, but I do try to avoid eating large meals altogether.

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/>&gt; I've heard that for the sake of maintaining higher metabolism, eating 4-5 smaller meals a day is better than 2-3 larger meals.<br/>I also have heard it! Eating 4-5 smaller meals seems to be common in Spain, and Spanish life expectancy is very high indeed. Actually, I'm interested in the dietary habit, because I often get hungry after several hours of my dinner. haha.
