# 【No. 2048】The Meaning of Dog: Part 2
<div class="date">Jun 1, 2023 10:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The Meaning of Dog: Part 2<br/><br/>In Part 1, I introduced several slang meanings of "dog" in Japan.<br/><br/>In English, "dog" has several slang meanings, such as "an unattractive person," "a worthless or contemptible person," "human foot," and "dude or fellow."<br/><br/>In Chinese, "dog (狗)" is used to describe a single man or woman in the form of "単身狗" (where "単身" means "single").<br/><br/>In Korean, "dog (개)" seems to have a meaning similar to the F-word in English.<br/><br/>There are various meanings of "dog" in different countries, but it seems to have mostly negative nuances, so we need to be careful when using it.

犬の意味 Part 2<br/><br/>Part 1 では、日本における「犬」の比喩的な意味を紹介しました。<br/><br/>一方、英語の dog は、動物の犬以外にも、「呼びかけの言葉」「醜い人」「女癖の悪い男」「人間の足」ような意味があるようです。<br/><br/>中国語の「犬（狗）」は、「単身狗」の形で、独身者を表す言葉として使われます。<br/><br/>韓国語の「犬（개）」は、Fワードのような意味を持つようです。<br/><br/>意味はさまざまですが、世界的にネガティブなニュアンスを持つことが多いようなので、注意が必要です。

Thank you for correcting my entry!<br/><br/>&gt; Human foot?? Never heard that before.<br/>Me neither. I'm not sure if this is actually used, but according to the internet, it seems to be used as a slang term in some regions. :)<br/><a href="https://yourfootpalace.com/my-dogs-are-barking-translation-my-feet-hurt/" target="_blank">https://yourfootpalace.com/my-dogs-are-barking-translation-my-feet-hurt/</a><br/><a href="https://talking-english.net/bark/" target="_blank">https://talking-english.net/bark/</a>#My_dogs_are_barking

Interesting! Looks like it's some kind of old (southern?) expression mostly associated with the idiom "my dogs are barking." <br/>Never heard it before so that's about all I can say. ^^;
