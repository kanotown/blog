うるさい<br/><br/>今日は、「うるさい」という日本語の言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「うる」は「心」を、「さい」は「狭い」という意味を持ち、「うるさい」は「心が乱れ、閉塞状態になる」ことを表します。<br/><br/>それが転じて一般的には「物音が大きくてやかましい」という意味で使われます。<br/><br/>「うるさい」と漢字で書くと「煩い」ですが、「五月蝿い」と書くこともあります。<br/><br/>「五月蝿」は「5月の蝿」という意味で、この時期にわく蝿は特にうるさいことから、この漢字が当てられています。<br/><br/>「五月蝿」と書いても通常は「うるさ」とは読みません。

Oh, I forgot to change the part from "動詞" to "言葉."<br/>Thank you for letting me know that :)<br/>By the way, the word class of "urusai" is an adjective (形容詞).

 How different is the usage of urusai and yakamashii ? Nice post btw :)
</p>

</div><div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
Thank you so much for the correction!<br/>"Yakamashii" is a little old/formal expression, and is often used by adults, while "urusai" is used by all ages.
