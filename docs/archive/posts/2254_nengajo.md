# 【No. 2254】<strong><em>Nengajō</em></strong> (年賀状 - New Year's Greeting Card): Part 1
<div class="date">Dec 23, 2023 23:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Nengajō</em></strong>: Part 1<br/><br/>Today, I wrote <strong><em>nengajō</em></strong> (年賀状).<br/><br/><em>Nengajō</em> is a traditional Japanese greeting card for celebrating the New Year.<br/><br/><strong><em>Nen</em></strong> (年) means "year," <strong><em>ga</em></strong> (賀) means "celebration," and <strong><em>jō</em></strong> (状) means "card," so the literal meaning of <em>nengajō</em> is "year celebration card."<br/><br/>The custom of exchanging <em>nengajō</em> originated from the traditional visits for New Year's greetings.<br/><br/>In the past, many Japanese people used to visit their relatives and those to whom they were indebted at the beginning of the year to give greetings.<br/><br/>However, as times have changed, more and more people have found it difficult to give greetings in person, and they started sending <em>nengajō</em> as an alternative to New Year's greetings.

年賀状 Part 1<br/><br/>私は今日、年賀状を書きました。<br/><br/>年賀状とは、日本の伝統的な新年を祝う挨拶状のことです。<br/><br/>「年」は "year"、「賀」は "celebration "、「状」は "card" を意味するので、「年賀状」の文字どおりの意味は "year celebration card" となります。<br/><br/>年賀状を新年に出し合う習慣の起源は、日本における年始の挨拶回りにあります。<br/><br/>日本では古くから、年のはじめに親族やお世話になった人々を訪問し、挨拶をして回る習慣がありました。<br/><br/>しかし、時代とともに直接訪問することが難しくなり、代わりに年賀状を送るようになったというわけです。

Thank you for the correction!<br/>I believe that the "to" following "indebted" is unnecessary because it is already included in "to whom." Would it be more natural to include it?

You're welcome! I have made another correction as I didn't know there was already a "to" in your sentence (I probably read too fast).
