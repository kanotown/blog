# 【No. 1821】<strong><em>Rōbashin</strong></em> (老婆心 - Excessive  Kindness)
<div class="date">Apr 21, 2021 08:33</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Rōbashin</strong></em><br/><br/>The feeling of worrying about someone or the desire to give someone a word of advice is referred to as <strong><em>rōbashin</em></strong> (老婆心) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>rō</em></strong> (老) means "old," <strong><em>ba/baba</em></strong> (婆) means "old lady" or "grandmother," and <strong><em>shin</em></strong> (心) means "heart," the literal meaning of <em>rōbashin</em> is "an old lady's heart."<br/><br/>Elderly women have experienced a lot in life and tend to care and worry about their children/grandchildren more than necessary, so such excessive kindness has come to be called <em>rōbashin</em>.<br/><br/>It is often used as <strong><em>rōbashin nagara</em></strong> (老婆心ながら - meaning "though it may not be necessary") with the adversative conjunction <strong><em>nagara</em></strong> (ながら).

老婆心<br/><br/>誰かを必要以上に心配する気持ちや、世話を焼きたがる気持ちのことを「老婆心」といいます。<br/><br/>「老」は "old"、「婆」は "old lady/grandmather"、「心」は "heart" を意味するので、「老婆心」の文字どおりの意味は "an old lady's heart" となります。<br/><br/>歳を重ねた女性は人生経験が豊富で、必要以上に子や孫に気を遣ったり心配したりすることから、そのような親切心を「老婆心」というようになりました。<br/><br/>逆接を表す接続助詞「ながら」を伴って、文頭で「老婆心ながら（意味：おせっかいかもしれませんが）」のように使用されることが多いです。
