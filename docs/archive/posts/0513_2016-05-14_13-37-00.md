# The Meaning of "々"
<div class="date">May 14, 2016 13:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about a Japanese sign "odoriji" (the literal meaning is a dancing character).<br/><br/>The "odoriji" is used when the same character is used repeatedly.<br/><br/>There is a typical odoriji "々," and the reading is either the same as the previous character or it with a voiced sound mark.<br/><br/>For example:<br/>時時 → 時々 (the meaning is "sometimes," and the reading is "toki-doki.")<br/>赤裸裸 → 赤裸々 (the meaning is "nudity," and the reading is "seki-rara.")<br/><br/>When you want to type only the odoriji "々," you convert "おどりじ(odoriji)," "おなじ(onaji)," or "くりかえし(kurikaeshi)" into Kanji on your input method editor.<br/><br/>Also, since "々" is able to be seen as a combination of "ノ (no)" and "マ (ma)," it sometimes called "ノマ点 (noma-sign)," and you can convert "のま (noma)" into "々" .

"々" の意味<br/><br/>今日は、日本語の「踊り字」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「踊り字」は、同じ文字が繰り返し利用されるときに使われる記号です。<br/><br/>代表的な踊り字として「々」があり、読み方は直前の文字と同じか、濁点を付けたものになります。<br/><br/>例：<br/>時時　→　時々（ときどき）<br/>赤裸裸　→　赤裸々（せきらら）<br/><br/>踊り字の「々」を単体で入力するためには、「おどりじ」「おなじ」「くりかえし」などで変換します。<br/><br/>また、「々」はカタカナの「ノ」と「マ」を繋げた文字にも見えることから「ノマ点」と呼ばれることもあり、「のま」で変換して出力することもできます。

 Writing this article was good practice for you and can really help other people to be able to understand Japanese. Thank you for teaching us about the odoriji mark.
 <br/>
 Keep writing these great posts and working hard.

 I have always called it the "Repeated Kanji character". This is an original japanese character, I have never seen it being used in Chinese.

Thank you for letting me know that :)<br/>I was not sure, but this character is also used for Hiragana, so it might be an original Japanese one, indeed.

<p class="correction_comment">I don't think adding the quotation marks is an error, but I wouldn't, because kanji and kana stand out from the text as it is. If I do use quotation marks for Japanese text in an English/Polish sentence I usually use the Japanese 「」brackets. <br/><br/>This is just my personal preference. :)</p>

Also, since 々 <span class="f_blue">can</span> be seen as a combination of ノ (no) and マ (ma), it sometimes called ノマ点 (noma-sign), and you can convert のま (noma) into 々.
<p class="correction_comment">"X can also be seen as Y"<br/>"Also, X can be seen as Y"<br/><br/>Those two sentences are slightly different. In the first one, you're giving Y as another thing, in addition to those you mentioned before, that X can be seen as. (You mention more than one thing that X can be seen as.) In the second one, you're saying that as an additional point, X can be seen as Y.</p>
