<h1 id="subject_show">Me ga Takai (目が高い - Having a Good Eye)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Aug 12, 2017 14:18</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There is the Japanese idiom, "me ga takai" (目が高い).<br/><br/>The "me" means "eye," and the "takai" means "high," so the literal meaning of "me ga takai" is "one's eyes are high."<br/><br/>Can you imagine what this idiom actually means?<br/><br/>The answer is that someone has an ability to choose superior things or people.<br/><br/>The etymology is simple -- it's because you can see things well if your eyes would be placed at a high position.<br/><br/>Incidentally, there is fish called "medaka" (メダカ/目高 - killifish) in Japan, and its name comes from the fact that killfish's eyes are high, but it's not related to this idiom.

目が高い<br/><br/>日本語には「目が高い」という慣用句があります。<br/><br/>「目が高い」の文字通りの意味は "one's eye are high" ですが、実際はどのような意味で使われるか想像できますか？<br/><br/>この言葉は、優れたものや人を見分ける能力を持っていることを表します。<br/><br/>語源はシンプルで、高い位置に目があれば、物事がよく見えるからです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「メダカ」という魚の名前は、高い位置に目があることに由来しますが、この慣用句とは関係ありません。

 Near perfect writing! With the exception of one sentence, it could've easily come from an English speaker!
