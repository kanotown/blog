Karuizawa Part 2<br/><br/>This entry continues from yesterday's one.<br/><br/>At almost the same time when Alexander Croft Shaw built a villa and church in Karuizawa, a railway was extended to there.<br/><br/>Furthermore, due to the influence of Shaw, Western hotels and churches were built one after another.<br/><br/>Because of these backgrounds, Karuizawa has developed as a summer resort for foreigners, and later, Japanese people came to build their villas here.<br/><br/>Now Karuizawa is very popular because people who live in Tokyo can go in about an hour by <strong><em>Shinkansen</em></strong> (新幹線 - "bullet train").<br/><br/>I would like to have my villa in Karuizawa someday.

軽井沢 Part 2<br/><br/>この投稿は、昨日の投稿の続きです。<br/><br/>アレクサンダー・クロフト・ショーが軽井沢に別荘と教会を建てたのと同時期に、軽井沢に鉄道が通りました。<br/><br/>さらに、ショーの影響で洋式ホテルや教会などが次々と建てられました。<br/><br/>このような背景から、軽井沢は外国人避暑地として発展し、日本人もここに別荘を建てるようになったというわけです。<br/><br/>軽井沢は、東京から新幹線で約1時間で着くアクセスの良さからも、人気があります。<br/><br/>いつか私も軽井沢に別荘を持ちたいです。
