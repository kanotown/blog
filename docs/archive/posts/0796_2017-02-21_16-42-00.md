Today I will talk about the relationship between mice and cheese.<br/><br/>In various animations, manga, and plays, you can see a scene that mice like cheese.<br/><br/>However, according to a study at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK, mice avoid cheese unless they are starving.<br/><br/>Since mice have a high metabolic rate, they prefer grain, fruits, and sweets that contain a lot of sugar.<br/><br/>Also, it is thought that mice dislike food that have a strong fermentation odor like cheese because of their keen olfactory sense.<br/><br/>Although there are several theories as the reason why we think that mice like cheese, there is no widely accepted one.

ネズミとチーズ<br/><br/>今日はネズミとチーズの関係について話します。<br/><br/>さまざまなアニメや漫画、劇などで「ネズミはチーズが好物」という場面が出てきます。<br/><br/>しかし、イギリスのマンチェスター・メトロポリタン大学の研究によると、ネズミはよほどの空腹状態でないかぎり、チーズは積極的に避けるようです。<br/><br/>ネズミは新陳代謝が活発なため、糖分の多い穀物や果物、甘い菓子などを好みます。<br/><br/>そして、もともとネズミは嗅覚が発達しているので、強い発酵臭を放つチーズは苦手だと考えられています。<br/><br/>ネズミはチーズが好きというイメージが定着した理由は諸説ありますが、有力なものはありません。
