<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There is the Japanese adjective word (slang expression), "dasai" (ダサい), which means "uncool" or "countrified."<br/><br/>This word has been used among young people in the Kanto region since the 1970s, but the exact etymology hasn't been clarified.<br/><br/>One of the most accepted theories about the etymology is that it comes from "inaka" (田舎), which means "countryside."<br/><br/>The theory says that the kanji of the noun "inaka" (田舎) can be read as "dasha" by the Chinese reading, and it changed to an adjective by adding "i" (い).<br/><br/>Another theory says that it comes from "datte saitama dakara" (だって埼玉だから - Because it's Saitama), which is a phrase for ridiculing Saitana citizens by Tokyo citizens.

ダサい<br/><br/>「格好悪い」「野暮ったい」などを意味する日本語の形容詞（俗語）に、「ダサい」があります。<br/><br/>この言葉は1970年代から関東地方の若者の間で広まったもので、正確な語源は明らかになっていません。<br/><br/>語源に関する有力な説の一つは、「田舎」を「だしゃ」と読み、「い」をつけて形容詞化したというものです。<br/><br/>その他の説としては、東京都民が埼玉県民を嘲笑した言葉「だって埼玉だから」を省略したというものがあります。
