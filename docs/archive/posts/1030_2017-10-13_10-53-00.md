あめ<br/><br/>日本語には同音異義語が多く存在するため、外国人はこれら単語の学習に苦労すると思います。<br/><br/>そのためこれからは、同音異義語の紹介もしていこうと思います。<br/>（だんだん語源に関するネタも尽きてきました。）<br/><br/>今日は、とても一般的な単語「あめ」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「あめ」は、"rain" (雨) と "candy" (飴) の二つの意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>「あ」にアクセントを持たせると「雨」、「め」にアクセントを持たせると「飴」の意味になります。<br/><br/>「雨」は「天（あめ）」もしくは「天水（あまみず）」を語源とする一方、「飴」は「甘い」を語源としています。<br/><br/>ちなみに関西地方では、よく「飴」に「ちゃん」をつけて「飴ちゃん」と呼びます。
