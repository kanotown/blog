A few days ago, computers of my colleagues came to act up.<br/><br/>Since the cause seemed to be the motherboard, it was difficult to repair it.<br/><br/>So today, I purchased some computer components, and built new ones for them.<br/><br/>I challenged to use the Mini-ITX standard for the first time, but I had trouble wiring the cords because of the smallness.<br/><br/>Finally, somehow I could complete them, and they worked.<br/><br/>I'm tired, but it was fun.

新しいPCの組み立て<br/><br/>数日前、同僚たちのPCの調子が悪くなり始めました。<br/><br/>マザーボードの調子が悪いようで、修理することは困難でした。<br/><br/>そのため今日、私はパソコンの部品を購入し、彼らのために新しくPCを組み立てました。<br/><br/>今回初めてMini-ITXの規格に挑戦しましたが、小さくて配線するのに苦労しました。<br/><br/>しかしなんとか完成し、無事動かすことができました。<br/><br/>疲れましたが、楽しかったです。<br/><br/>
