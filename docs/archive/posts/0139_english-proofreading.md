# 【No. 0139】English proofreading
<div class="date">May 6, 2015 20:43</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today is the last day of Japanese long-term holidays, but I was writing my graduation thesis in English as well as yesterday.<br/><br/>Since there are so many technical terms in the thesis, I'm concerned about whether my sentences make sense.<br/><br/>Therefore, when I finish writing the thesis, I will ask native experts to correct.<br/><br/>It costs 12 yen per one word, so one page that was written about 500 words cost about 6,000 yen.<br/><br/>It seems my doctoral thesis be more than 100 pages (because my master's thesis was about 100 pages), when I ask to correct all the pages, it will cost more than 600,000 yen.<br/><br/>I don't know whether this price is expensive or not, but maybe I should invest such money for writing a good doctoral thesis.

今日は長期連休の最終日ですが、私は昨日と同様に英語で卒業論文を書いていました。<br/><br/>専門用語が多いので、意味が通じるのかとても心配です。<br/><br/>そこで、私は論文が書けたら、ネイティブの専門家に校正の依頼しようと考えています。<br/><br/>1単語につき12円程かかるので、約500単語書かれた1ページには約6000円かかります。<br/><br/>博士論文は100ページを超えると思われるので（修士論文が100ページ程だったため）、全ページ校正してもらうと約60万円以上かかります。<br/><br/>安いのか高いのかいまいちよくわかりませんが、良い英語の博士論文を書くためには、これくらいの投資は必要なのかもしれません。

 Are the pages all text or is there also graphs and tables to take up space?

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>&gt; I will ask native speakers to correct it.<br/>Actually, in this sentence, I wanted to say something like "I will ask native speakers who are also technology professionals (experts) to correct it."<br/><br/>&gt; Are the pages all text or is there also graphs and tables to take up space?<br/>Ah, I forgot it. The pages include graphs, tables and equations, and they will occupy around 30 %, so the cost will be 30 % OFF!
