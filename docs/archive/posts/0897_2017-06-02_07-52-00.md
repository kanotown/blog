# 【No. 0897】<strong><em>Kerenmi</strong></em> (けれん味)
<div class="date">Jun 2, 2017 07:52</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
How many compliments do you have?<br/><br/>Of course, I think that there are various types of compliments in every language.<br/><br/>Today I'd like to introduce Japanese one of them, "kerenmi ga nai" (けれん味がない), which is high-toned and is difficult to use even for us.<br/><br/>"Kerenmi" comes from a Kabuki term, and it means to call a bluff or to play dumb.<br/><br/>Therefore, "kerenmi ga nai" (there is no 'kerenmi') means that there is no pretense, bluff, and lie -- that refers to sincerity.<br/><br/>Basically this term is used as a compliment, but note that it could be used with a negative connotation, for example in the media world where bluffs and lies are needed.

けれん味<br/><br/>皆さんは、人を褒めるときの言葉のバリエーションをどれくらい持っているでしょうか？<br/><br/>当然、あらゆる言語でさまざまな形の褒め言葉があると思います。<br/><br/>今日は、そんな中から日本人でもなかなか使えない、少し格調の高い日本語の褒め言葉「けれん味がない」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「けれん味」は歌舞伎用語に由来し、はったりをきかせたり、ごまかしたりすることを意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち、「けれん味がない」とは、人からよく見られようとするわざとらしさや、はったり、ごまかしがないことを意味します。<br/><br/>基本的には褒め言葉として使われますが、はったりやごまかしが必要なメディア業界などでは、悪い意味で使われることもあることに注意して下さい。

Today I'd like to introduce Japanese one of them, "kerenmi ga nai" (けれん味がない), which is (somewhat?) high-toned and is difficult to use even for us.
<p class="correction_comment">high-toned --&gt; (somewhat?) high-toned - I only did this based on Bori's correction. I did a google translate and it didn't have anything related to this part of your sentence.<br/><br/>I like the sound of your original "high-toned" over "high class" . They are close in meaning but have, to me, a bit of a difference in emphasis. I haven't a clue what your intention is though.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">I like your original. To my ear "media world" sounds more natural than "world of media" but that is a good option too.</p>

 I liked Bori's suggestion too.

Thank you so much always for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; high-toned...<br/>This part is related to "格調の高い" (or 格調が高い). I think that I can use "graceful" or "elegant" instead of "high-toned."

Both of your alternatives have a visual/emotional feeling that high-toned doesn't. For what it's work I like them.

By the way (btw), as another example of the type of word choices you make your English is probably richer than 90%+ of natural English speakers. Probably even higher than that.
