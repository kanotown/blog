# 【No. 1197】<strong><em>Happa wo Kakeru</strong></em> (はっぱをかける - Firing Someone up)
<div class="date">Mar 29, 2018 21:52</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
If you want to give someone a kick in the back, you may use strong language.<br/><br/>Such an act is called はっぱをかける (happa wo kakeru) in Japanese.<br/><br/>I think that most Japanese people will image "leaf" when they hear はっぱ (happa), but this is wrong.<br/><br/>"Happa" in "happa wo kakeru" means an explosive or to blow up something in a construction site.<br/><br/>Also, かける (kakeru) means to set something.<br/><br/>Therefore, the literal meaning of "happa wo kakeru" is to set off an explosive, and it implies that you use strong words like a bomb to hurry someone.

はっぱをかける<br/><br/>強い言葉をかけたりして誰かに気合を入れることを、「はっぱをかける」と言います。<br/><br/>「はっぱ」とだけ聞くと、多くの日本人は "leaf" を想像しますが、違います。<br/><br/>ここでの「はっぱ」は工事現場における爆薬や、爆薬を使って爆破することを意味する言葉です。<br/><br/>また、「かける」 "to set something" を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち「はっぱをかける」とは、爆弾のような強い言葉をかけるということです。

 Thanks for teaching me this phrase! I English we might say 'light a fire under someone' or 'light a fire under だれだれ'.

Thank you so much for correcting my post and letting me know the phrase!<br/><br/>I have a question. Since "happa" can mean "gunpowder" or "explosive" that causes an explosion, I used the word "explosive," but is this unnatural?

You can say 'an explosive', but it sounds a little stiff to me. Most of the time I hear 'explosive', it's used an an adjective, like 'explosive words' or 'explosive materials'.
