# 【No. 1042】<strong><em>Tonton Byōshi</em></strong> (とんとん拍子 - Swimmingly)
<div class="date">Oct 25, 2017 12:15</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I often use the Japanese term "tonton byōshi" (とんとん拍子), when things go as I want them to.<br/><br/>The "tonton" (とんとん) of "tonton byōshi" is an onomatopoeia that represents the sound of stepping on the floor rhythmically while aligning with clapping of his/her teacher.<br/><br/>Therefore, just "tonton" can mean that things go well, but this term also has other meanings, such as the sound of hitting something or that profits/losses between two are the same.<br/><br/>If you add the term "byōshi" (拍子), which means rhythm, it can clearly mean that things go as you expect.<br/><br/>For example, you can use it like "Kōshō ga tonton byōshi ni susumu" (交渉がとんとん拍子に進む - The negociation is going along swimmingly).

とんとん拍子<br/><br/>物事が思い通りに進むとき、私はよく「とんとん拍子」という表現を使います。<br/><br/>「とんとん拍子」の「とんとん」は、舞台で師匠の手拍子に合わせて踊る際に、調子良く床を踏む音を表す擬音語です。<br/><br/>このため「とんとん」だけでも、「順調に進む」の意味を有しますが、「とんとん」は「物を叩く音」や「二つの損得がほぼ同じ事」などの意味も有します。<br/><br/>具合や調子を表す「拍子」をつけると、「物事が順調に進む」という意味に限定されます。<br/><br/>例えば「交渉がとんとん拍子に進む」のように使います。

 Very well written. And you taught me a new word!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I don't understand the English or the Japanese in the "two losses" part though.

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/><br/>&gt; I don't understand the English or the Japanese in the "two losses" part though.<br/>Sorry for my confusing English.<br/>I think that I should have said something like<br/>"profits are almost the same as losses."

The "tonton" (とんとん) of "tonton byōshi" is an onomatopoeia that represents the sound of stepping on the floor rhythmically while aligning with <span class="f_red">the</span> clapping of <span class="f_red">the/one's</span> teacher <span class="f_blue">OR</span> the sound of <span class="f_red">someone</span> stepping [...] with <span class="f_red">the</span> clapping of his/her teacher.
<p class="correction_comment">Since you haven't explicitly mentioned an individual that "his/her" could refer to, it's a little strange to get to that part and think, 'Who is this his/her?' "One" is a general placeholder for a person/people."The" doesn't point to an individual (in this case, the student of that teacher), so you wouldn't need to mention an individual. Adding "someone" provides an individual to attach "his/her" to, so that would work as well.</p>

<li class="corrected correct">
Therefore, just "tonton" can mean that things go well, but this term also has other meanings, such as the sound of hitting something or <span class="f_red">two sides that are evenly matched</span>.
<p class="correction_comment">When making lists, English flows better when the list items are consistent grammatically. In this case, "the sound..." is a noun, so I'd recommend changing the second item to a similar format ("two sides..."). There's probably a better way to phrase it, though.</p>

 Interesting! You learn something new every day. :)
 <br/>
 I'm not the best at explaining, so if there's anything in my comments that's confusing, I'd be happy to (try to) clarify.
