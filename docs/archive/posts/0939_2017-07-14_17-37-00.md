奥さん<br/><br/>日本語では、他人の妻のことを「奥さん」と言うことがよくあります。<br/><br/>「奥」はもともと、内部へ深く入ったところや、入り口から離れた場所のことを指します。<br/><br/>そこから、入り口から遠い部屋やそこに住む人を指すようになりました。<br/><br/>「奥さん」の「さん」は人名などに付ける丁寧の接尾語で、より丁寧な表現として「奥様」のように「様」をつけることもあります。<br/><br/>この言葉は、日本では奥に住むのは女性という認識があったことに由来します。<br/><br/>ただ、「奥」という言葉は決して女性を卑下したものではありません。<br/><br/>事実、「奥ゆかしい」という「奥」を使った言葉は、多くの女性にとって褒め言葉です。
