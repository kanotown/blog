Automatic doors sometimes don't react to me.<br/><br/>It's a little embarrassing.<br/><br/>Formerly there were automatic doors that detect  weights, but recently almost all of them use infrared sensors.<br/><br/>Therefore, the reason why automatic doors don't react is due to your clothes or your hair colors.<br/><br/>Basically, when the color is dark or the similar to the floor/mat color, it's difficult to react.<br/><br/>Conversely, when your clothes/hair color is bright or gaudy, it's easy to react.<br/><br/>If the automatic door doesn't react to you, let's move strongly with a bright thing.

自動ドア<br/><br/>私は時々、自動ドアが反応してくれないことがあります。<br/><br/>ちょっと恥ずかしいです。<br/><br/>昔は体重を感知するものもありましたが、現在の自動ドアはほとんど赤外線センサーを用います。<br/><br/>そのため、ドアが開かない原因は服装や髪の色などにあります。<br/><br/>基本的には、暗い色であったり、床やマットと同じ色の服であったりすると、反応しづらいです。<br/><br/>逆に、明るい色の服を着ていたり肌の露出が多い場合、カラフルな髪の色をしている人は、反応しやすくなります。<br/><br/>どうしても反応しない場合は、明るいものを持って大きな動作をしましょう。

<p class="correction_comment">A more common way to say the beginning is just: "There used to be automatic doors that detected weight~" instead of using 'formerly'<br/>You didn't mention change, so you don't have to use 'recently', just say they are 'now using infrared sensors'</p>

Therefore, the reason why automatic doors don't react is due to <span class="f_blue">either </span>your clothes or <span class="sline">your</span> hair <span class="f_blue">color</span>.

Thank you so much the corrections and your explanations! :)<br/><br/>&gt; This last part doesn't quite make sense, but I think you're trying to say:<br/>"~you should try moving through with bright clothing".<br/><br/>Sorry for my obscure English and thank you for presuming my thought. <br/>Actually, I wanted to say something like:<br/>...you should try shaking your arm (or body) while holding bright things such as papers. It may look like you're waving a flag.
