# 【No. 0657】<strong><em>Onna Gokoro to Aki no Sora</strong></em> (Women's Feelings and Autumn sky)
<div class="date">Oct 5, 2016 18:43</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There is the proverb "onna gokoro to aki no sora," the meaning of which is "women's Feelings and autumn sky."<br/><br/>This proverb expresses that women are as fickle as autumn weather.<br/><br/>Actually, there is also a similar proverb "otoko gokoro to aki no sora," the meaning of which is "men's feelings and autumn sky."<br/><br/>This proverb expresses that men are as fickle as autumn weather, and tend to cheat on their partners.<br/><br/>It's thought that the proverb came from the fact that cheating by married woman was punished heavily, while cheating by men wasn't in the Edo period.<br/><br/>Today, such sex discrimination vanished, and I think that the women version of the proverb is used more frequently than the men version.

女心と秋の空<br/><br/>日本には、「女心と秋の空」ということわざがあります。<br/><br/>この言葉は、変わりやすい秋の空のように、女性の気持ちも移り気で変わりやすいということを表します。<br/><br/>実は、「男心と秋の空」ということわざもあり、もともとはこちらが使われていました。<br/><br/>この言葉は、秋の空のように男の愛情は変わりやすい、すなわち男は浮気しやすい、ということを表します。<br/><br/>江戸時代、既婚女性の浮気は重い罰が与えられたのに対し、男性は比較的軽かったことに由来すると考えられています。<br/><br/>今ではそのような差別は無くなり、「女心と秋の空」がよく使われていると思います。

 This sounds very similar to lyrics from the song 病名恋ワズライ by HoneyWorks. Here's the lyrics: 乙女心変わる秋の空 It's close, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't mean the same thing. (^^;

 Thanks for the post! It's as interesting as always!

Thank you for your comment!<br/><br/>Yes, the lyrics mean the same thing. :)<br/>By the way, I heard there is a similar proverb in English: "A woman's mind and winter wind change oft."
