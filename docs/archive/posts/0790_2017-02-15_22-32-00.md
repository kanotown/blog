風邪<br/><br/>風邪をひいてしまいました。<br/><br/>喉と頭が痛く、悪寒がします。<br/><br/>今日は、風邪についての雑学を少し話そうと思います。<br/><br/>風邪は9割以上がウイルス感染によるものです。<br/><br/>ウイルスの種類は800以上にのぼり、これらウイルスを抑える薬は未だに存在しません。<br/><br/>我々が病院で処方してもらう薬は、風邪の症状を抑える効果しかありません。<br/><br/>風邪薬には副作用もあるため、多くの医師や薬剤師が風邪にかかった際は、薬に頼らず自然に治癒するのを待つそうです。<br/><br/>もし風邪の特効薬を開発することができたら、ほぼ確実にノーベル賞をもらえるようです。
