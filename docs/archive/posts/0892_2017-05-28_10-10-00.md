# 【No. 0892】<strong><em>Meboshi wo Tsukeru</strong></em> (目星をつける)
<div class="date">May 28, 2017 10:10</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
It is important to make an educated guess or establish a goal when you conduct/investigate something.<br/><br/>Such making an educated guess is often called "meboshi wo tsukeru (目星をつける)" in Japan.<br/><br/>"Me (目)" means "eye," "boshi (星)" usually means "star," but it also means "mark" derived from "star mark."<br/><br/>Since "tsukeru (つける)" means "to put/attach something," the literal meaning of "meboshi wo tsukeru" is "to put a mark."<br/><br/>In turn, this term has come to mean "to make an educated guess" or "to establish a goal."

目星をつける<br/><br/>何かを遂行・調査するとき、見当をつけたり目標とするところを定めることは重要です。<br/><br/>このように見当をつけることを、日本語では「目星をつける」と言います。<br/><br/>「目」は 'eye' を、「星」は的の中央につける星印から転じて 'mark (印)' を意味します。<br/><br/>「つける」は "to put/attach something" を意味するため、「目星をつける」の文字どおりの意味は "to put a mark (目印をつける)" となります。<br/><br/>これが転じて、「見当をつける」や「目標を定める」という意味で使われるようになりました。
