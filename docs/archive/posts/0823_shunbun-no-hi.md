 Great writing, very clear. I thought that Spring was "haru"? I guess there's more ways of saying it. Either way, keep up the great posts. I'm interested to hear more about Japan through your writing. がんばって

I don't believe this is true.  I've always been taught to put them inside the quotes.  Beyond this, putting them within the quotes is how they do it in books.

Hmm. It's interesting, I looked into it and it turns out there is a British and an American method. I guess when I took my writing courses I was taught the British method of periods outside of the quotation marks. But you're not wrong if you want to learn the American method, so the author can disregard my comments there.

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>I'm glad to hear you say that :)<br/><br/>&gt; I thought that Spring was "haru"? I guess there's more ways of saying it.<br/>Yes, "spring" is "春" -- you can read the kanji as "haru" in kun-yomi (Japanese readings of character) or "shun" in on-yomi (Chinese readings of character).
