ゴキブリとの遭遇<br/><br/>昨夜、ファストフード店で夕食を食べて帰ろうとしたら、店の外でゴキブリを見つけました。<br/><br/>とても衝撃的でした。<br/><br/>長野県に住んでいたときは全く見なかったので、およそ9年ぶりにごきぶりと遭遇したことになります。<br/><br/>今のところ私のアパートにはまだゴキブリが出ていませんが、あまり綺麗でもありません。<br/><br/>私の部屋はキッチン回りは綺麗ですが（ほとんど料理をしないので）、ダンボールなどが多いです。<br/><br/>そしてゴキブリは、ダンボールが好きだそうで、ダンボール内に卵を産んだりするそうです。<br/><br/>ゴキブリが出ないように、しっかりと部屋をダンボールを片付けようと思います。

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>&gt; I corrected it to saw a cockroach as I wasn't sure if you were actually MEETING a cockroach, as if it were in front of you, or saw as in it was crawling up a wall.<br/>The cockroach was crawling on the ground, and I just saw it, so I think the word "saw" is more appropriate. Thank you :)
