# 【No. 1290】<strong><em>Hoshikage</em></strong> (星影)
<div class="date">Jun 30, 2018 20:59</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
What comes to your mind when you hear <strong><em>hoshikage</em></strong> (星影)?<br/><br/>Hoshi (星) means <em>star</em> and kage (影) means 'shadow.'<br/><br/>Because of this, you (even Japanese people) might think that <em>hoshikage</em> is "a shadow created by the light of a star."<br/><br/>However, the actual meaning of <em>hoshikage</em> is just 'starlight.'<br/><br/>Originally, the word <em>kage</em> meant 'light.'<br/><br/>Later, it came to mean also "a black shape created by the light and an object," and now it is mainly used as the latter meaning.<br/><br/>Incidentally, if you want to say <em>moonlight</em> in Japanese, you can say <strong><em>tsukikage</em></strong> (月影 - here, <em>tsuki</em> means 'moon') in the same manner as the case of 'hoshikage.'

星影<br/><br/>「星影」と聞いて何を思い浮かべますか？<br/><br/>「星」は 'star,' 「影」は一般的に 'shadow' を意味します。<br/><br/>このことから、「星影」と聞いて「星の光によって作り出される影」を想像してしまうかもしれません。<br/><br/>しかし、実は「星影」は「星の光」を意味します。<br/><br/>もともと「影」という言葉は、「光」を意味する言葉でした。<br/><br/>後に、「光が物体に遮られてできる黒い形」のことも「影」と呼ぶようになり、現在では主に 'shadow' の意味になったというわけです。<br/><br/>同様に、「月影」と言うことで「月の光」を表すこともできます。

 Hi Toru!  It's very interesting to find out the etymology of words.  I'll have to check out some of your older posts.

<p class="correction_comment">I think if you change "incidentally" to "similarly" you can avoid the awkwardness of the latter part of your sentence.<br/><br/>Also, "incidentally" carries a bit of 偶然 meaning with it. And I'm guessing that the etymology of these words is somewhat connected. So "similarly" may be a better option because of that as well.</p>
