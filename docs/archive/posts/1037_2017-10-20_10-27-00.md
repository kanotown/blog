引っ張りだこ<br/><br/>多くの人から求められるような人を見たことがありますか？<br/><br/>あるいはあなたがそのような人ですか？<br/><br/>そのように求められること、およびそのような人のことを、日本語で「引っ張りだこ」と言います。<br/><br/>「引っ張り」は "pulling something up," 「だこ」は "octopus" を意味します。<br/><br/>日本では、タコの干物を作るとき、8本の足を周囲に引っ張って干します。<br/><br/>このようすを「引っ張りだこ」と言い、かつてはその形から「磔の刑」や「罪人」を意味していたようですが、現在では「引く手あまたの人気者」を意味するようになりました。
