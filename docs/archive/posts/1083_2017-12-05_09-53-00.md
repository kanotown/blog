# <strong><em>Kōcha</strong></em> (紅茶 - Black Tea)
<div class="date">Dec 5, 2017 09:53</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I'm drinking "kōcha" (紅茶) right now.<br/><br/>The "kō" (紅) means "red" and the "cha" (茶) means "tea," so the literal meaning of "kōcha" is "red tea."<br/><br/>The etymology is very simple -- the "red" in "red tea" describes the color of the liquid. <br/><br/>In English, it is called just "tea" in most cases, but it's also called "black tea" due to the color of the oxidized leaves.<br/>(I also heard that "black tea" implies tea without milk, sugar or lemon.)<br/><br/>Incidentally, in the UK famous for tea, around 98% of tea is drank with milk.

紅茶<br/><br/>私は今、紅茶を飲んでいます。<br/><br/>「紅」は "red," 「茶」は "tea" を意味するので、「紅茶」の文字通りの意味は "red tea" となります。<br/><br/>語源はとても単純で、抽出液の色が赤みがかっているからです。<br/><br/>英語では単に "tea" と呼ばれることが最も多いようですが、茶葉の色が黒であることから "black tea" とも呼ばれています。<br/>（"Black tea" はミルクやレモン、砂糖など何も入れない紅茶を意味するとも聞きました。）<br/><br/>ちなみに、紅茶で有名なイギリスでは、98％の紅茶がミルクティーとして飲まれているそうです。
