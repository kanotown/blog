仮病<br/><br/>最近、「仮病」で学校や仕事を休む若者が増えてきていると思います。<br/><br/>「仮」は「仮の」や「偽の」、「病」は「病気」を意味し、「仮病」は「病気でないのに病気のふりをすること」を意味します。<br/><br/>仮病の症状として多いのは、「頭痛」「腹痛」「吐気」「発熱」があります。<br/><br/>特に「頭痛」や「腹痛」などは第3者により確認が困難なため、好んで利用されるようです。<br/><br/>また、仮病の次に多いずる休みの理由としては、「身内の不幸」があります。<br/><br/>身内を仮想的に危篤にしたり、親戚を仮想的に亡くなったことにして、休むといものです。<br/><br/>このような嘘は、絶対につくべきではありません。

Of course adults and older people also use this lie. However, as a general tendency in Japan, young people like students or new employees use it more frequently than older people.
