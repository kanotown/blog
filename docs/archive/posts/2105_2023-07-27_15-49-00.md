<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Ā Ie ba Kō Iu</strong></em> (ああ言えばこう言う - Having a Smart Mouth)</h1>
<div class="date">Jul 27, 2023 15:49</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Ā Ie ba Kō Iu</strong></em><br/><br/>The Japanese idiom, "ā ie ba kō iu" (ああ言えばこう言う), describes a situation where someone always disagrees with what others say by providing various reasons."<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>ā</em></strong> (ああ) means "that," <strong><em>ie/iu</em></strong> (言え/言う) means "to say," and <strong><em>kō</em></strong> (こう) means "this," the literal meaning of this idiom is "when we say that, you say this."<br/><br/>In other words, whenever someone says "that" (advice or persuades), you say "this" (counterarguments).<br/><br/>Let<em>s make an effort to accept others</em> opinions with an open mind.

ああ言えばこう言う<br/><br/>人の言ったことに対して、何かと理屈を並べて反対するさまを、「ああ言えばこう言う」と言うことがあります。<br/><br/>「ああ」は "that"、「言え/言う」は "to say"、「こう」は "this" を意味するので、「ああ言えばこう言う」の文字どおりの意味は "when we say that, you say this" となります。<br/><br/>「ああ」という発言や説得がある度に「こう」反論して、他人に従おうとしないというわけです。<br/><br/>人の意見は素直に受け止める努力をしましょう。
