# 【No. 1370】<strong><em>Shiru Hito zo Shiru</strong></em> (知る人ぞ知る)
<div class="date">Sep 18, 2018 19:36</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Shiru Hito zo Shiru</strong></em><br/><br/>Today I will introduce you to the Japanese expression <strong><em>shiru hito zo shiru</em></strong> (知る人ぞ知る).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>shiru</em></strong> (知る) means "know" and <strong><em>hito</em></strong> (人) means "people" or "person," the literal meaning of this expression is "people who know it know it."<br/><br/>You might think that the literal meaning is natural and obvious.<br/><br/>However, the actual meaning of it is that everyone doesn't know it, but some informed people know it is valuable/important.<br/><br/>Shiru hito zo shiru is usually used as an adjective, for example, <strong><em>shiru hito zo shiru resutoran</em></strong> (知る人ぞ知るレストラン - a restaurant that is known only to a few informed people).

知る人ぞ知る<br/><br/>今日は「知る人ぞ知る」という表現を紹介します。<br/><br/>「知る」は "know," 「人」は "person" や "people" を意味するので、「知る人ぞ知る」の文字通りの意味は "people who know it know it" となります。<br/><br/>文字通りの意味を考えると、「知る人が知っている」なんて当たり前に感じることと思います。<br/><br/>しかし実際には、「誰もが知っているわけではないが、一部の人にとってはその存在や価値がよく知られている」という意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>「知る人ぞ知る」は基本的に、「知る人ぞ知るレストラン」のように形容詞として用いられます。
