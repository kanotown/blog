ぴえん<br/><br/>「ぴえん」という言葉を聞いたことがありますか？<br/><br/>「ぴえん」は、日本のSNSで2018年末頃から若者の間で広く使われるようになった、泣いているさまを表す擬態語です。<br/><br/>「ぴえん」の由来は泣き声の「ぴえーん」であり、悲しいときにも嬉しいときにも、気軽に使うことができます。<br/><br/>目を潤わせて困った顔をした顔文字とともに用いられることが多く、その顔文字自体が「ぴえん」と呼ばれることもあります。<br/><br/>実際、最近のスマートフォンでは「ぴえん」で変換すると、その顔文字が出てきます。

 I'm curious when you would use ぴえん in a happy situation.

Thank you for the correction!<br/>I think that ぴえん in a happy situation is used when a significant event has occurred or you are extremely happy. For example, 「大学に合格した！ぴえん」.<br/>To tell you the truth, I have rarely used ぴえん, because I am not so young, haha.
