<div class="date">Jul 19, 2023 17:14</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Monzen Barai</em></strong><br/><br/>The action of turning away a visitor without meeting them is called <strong><em>monzen barai</em></strong> (門前払い) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>mon</em></strong> (門) means "gate," <strong><em>zen</em></strong> (前) means "front," and <strong><em>barai/harai</em></strong> (払い) means "to expel," the literal meaning of this phrase is "to expel someone from the front gate."<br/><br/>Originally, this phrase meant the lightest banishment sentence during the Edo period, which involved expelling the offender from the front gate of the magistrate's office.<br/><br/>This has evolved over time to carry its current meaning.<br/><br/>If you are a visitor who is turned away without meeting anyone, you can say something like <strong><em>monzen barai wo kū</em></strong> (門前払いを食う), using the verb <strong><em>kū</em></strong> (食う), which means "to experience an undesirable situation."

門前払い<br/><br/>訪ねてきた人に会わないで追い返すことを、「門前払い」と言います。<br/><br/>「門」は "gate"、「前」は "front"、「払い」は "to expel" を意味するので、「門前払い」の文字どおりの意味は "to expel someone from the front gate" となります。<br/><br/>もともとこの言葉は、江戸時代の追放刑の中で最も軽い、奉行所の門前から追い払う刑罰を表すものでした。<br/><br/>これが転じて現在の意味を持つようになったというわけです。<br/><br/>あなたが訪問者で追い返される場合は、「好ましくない事を身に受けること」を意味する「食う」を使って「門前払いを食う」のように言います。
