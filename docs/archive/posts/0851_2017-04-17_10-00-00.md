おつむ<br/><br/>今日は「おつむ」という単語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「おつむ」は、「頭」という意味であり、主に幼児に対して用いられます。<br/><br/>かつて、丸くて小さいものを、「粒」を変化させて「つぶり」と呼んでいました。<br/><br/>そして、子どもの小さい頭を、「つぶり」を変化させて「つむり」と呼んでいました。<br/><br/>この「つむり」に、言葉を丁寧にする接頭語である「お」を付けて、「おつむり」となり、最終的には「り」が省略されて「おつむ」となりました。<br/><br/>「おつむ」を大人に対して用いる際は、基本的に皮肉の意味が込められます。<br/><br/>例：「おつむが弱い」「おつむが足りない」
