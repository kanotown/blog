<p class="comment_small">
 Haha. Been a while. I am glad you are still at it. This is a phrase I used on my sensei when we had Japanese classes. I suppose in my context, it meant "thank you for your hard work".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As an English speaker, it's a little unusual how a number of Japanese phrases are used for very different situations. よろしく is one example. I don't think I would be wrong to say that unlike other languages, Japanese is more dependent on rank and context.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I am guessing that makes translation very difficult.

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>Writing posts on lang-8 is one of my most important daily works, haha.<br/><br/>Yes, unfortunately, there are many phrases that depend on the context in Japanese.<br/>It is actually useful for us, but it might be confusing for people who learn Japanese.
