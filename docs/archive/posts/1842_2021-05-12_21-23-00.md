貴様<br/><br/>日本語では、人に対する敬称として「様」がよく使われます。<br/><br/>また、団体や学校に付ける敬称として「貴」があります。<br/><br/>そして、これら二つの敬称を組み合わせた「貴様」という単語があります。<br/><br/>それぞれの漢字の意味を考えると、「貴様」は相手への敬意を強く表す言葉となります。<br/><br/>事実、この言葉はかつて、文字どおり敬意をもって用いられた二人称代名詞でした。<br/><br/>しかし、現在では相手を罵って使う言葉となり、日常ではあまり使われなくなりました。<br/><br/>このように意味が変化したのは、遊郭で遊女が客に「貴様」と使うようになったことがきっかけであると言われています。
