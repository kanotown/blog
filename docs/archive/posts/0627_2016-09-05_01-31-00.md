<h1 id="subject_show">Hana mo Hajirau (Even Flowers Get Shy)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Sep 5, 2016 01:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese adjective "hana mo hajirau."<br/><br/>This is used to describe that a young woman is greenly and beautiful.<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "even flowers get shy," that is to say, it implies that the woman is so beautiful it makes even beautiful flowers feel inferior and get shy.<br/><br/>For example, this adjective is used as: "hana mo hajirau otome," or "hana mo hajirau otoshigoro."<br/><br/>"Otome" means a maiden, and "otoshigoro" means puberty, but I think that both of above example sentences can be translated into "a girl in the first flush of youth" in English.<br/><br/>As of this adjective, the Japanese language often uses flowers when describing the beauty of women.

 Hi Kanotownさん！^^
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Great post as always. Thank you for explaining the usage of this adjective! It is the first time I am seeing this adjective, so I find it rather interesting that there is such a phrase.
