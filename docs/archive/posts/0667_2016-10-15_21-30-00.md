# Imoni Kai
<div class="date">Oct 15, 2016 21:30</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, my laboratory members and I held imoni kai, the literal meaning of which is "stewed potato party."<br/><br/>Imoni kai is a traditional Japanese party that people make a nabe (pot) dish using taro and eat it in a river bed, and this party is mainly held in the Tohoku region in Japan.<br/><br/>Since the harvest season of taro is around October, imoni kai is normally held in autumn.<br/><br/>There are various seasoning ways, and we made two types of them: "Tonjiru-style"(which is seasoned like miso soup) and "Sukiyaki-style" (which is seasoned with soy source and sugar).<br/><br/>It was a hard work because we had to make furnaces by assembling stones.<br/><br/>However, both styles were really delicious and I was satisfied.

芋煮会<br/><br/>今日は大学の研究室のメンバで、芋煮会を行いました。<br/><br/>芋煮会とは、河川敷で里芋を使った鍋料理を作って食べる行事で、主に日本の東北地方で行われています。<br/><br/>里芋の収穫時期が10月頃であるため、一般的には秋に開催されます。<br/><br/>味付けは東北の地方によって大きく異なり、今日は「豚汁風」と「すき焼き風」の二通りを作って食べました。<br/><br/>河川敷で石を並べてかまどを作るところからだったので大変でしたが、どちらもとても美味しく、大満足でした。
