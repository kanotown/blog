# <strong><em>Chi to Nari Niku to Naru</strong></em> (血となり肉となる)
<div class="date">May 18, 2018 14:34</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Have you ever heard of the Japanese idiom, chi to nari niku to naru (血となり肉となる)?<br/><br/>Chi (血) means "blood," niku (肉) means "flesh," and to naru (となる) means "to become," the literal meaning of this idiom is "it becomes one's blood and flesh."<br/><br/>This idiom can mean that what you ate is absorbed my your body and becomes your blood and flesh literally.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is also often used to mean that you acquire skills or knowledge that will be helpful for your future activities by comparing blood and flesh to your abilities.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the abbreviation of this idiom is ketsuniku to naru (血肉となる).<br/><br/>Note that the reading of the kanji 血 is ketsu (not chi) here.<br/>(Even Japanese people mistakenly read it as chiniku to naru.)

血となり肉となる<br/><br/>日本語の慣用句に、「血となり肉となる」があります。<br/><br/>「血」は "blood," 「肉」は "flesh," 「となる」は "to become" を意味するので、「血となり肉となる」は "it becomes one's blood and flesh" を意味します。<br/><br/>この慣用句は文字通り、「食べたものが吸収されて、栄養となること」を意味することもあります。<br/><br/>一方で、血や肉を能力に例えて、「学んだ知識や技能が身について、将来の活動に役立つものとなる」を意味するためにもよく使われます。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「血」と「肉」をまとめて「血肉となる」と言うこともあります。<br/><br/>このとき、「血」の読み方が「ち」ではなく「けつ」になることに注意して下さい。<br/>（日本人でも「ちにくとなる」と間違えて読む人が多いです。）
