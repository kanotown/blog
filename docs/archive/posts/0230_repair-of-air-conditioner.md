Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>&gt; not sure what you mean here?<br/>I'm sorry for the poor English. I wanted to say something like <br/>"I was carrying my burden (such as PC, books, and research tools) to the new place just a little while ago. So now I'm tired."

<p class="correction_comment">Using "the" is not necessary here because "summer vacation" is something occurs every year.  If summer vacation only occurs once, or if it only occurs rarely, then using "the" would be acceptable.

<p class="correction_comment">It is best to say "a little while" instead of "a while."  This is because "a while" means "a long time."  To say "a little time," it is best to write "a little while."  This may be a bit confusing because "a little while" is vernacular English and commonly used by native speakers.</p>

 I am very impressed with your English.  You are able to produce complex sentences!  Your mistakes are a natural part of learning advanced English.  English grammar is very complicated and nuanced, so it always takes time to develop a more natural speaking style.  Keep up the great work!  あなたは手に話しますね！

Thank you very much for your corrections and helpful comments! :D Your explanations are really helpful for me, and I'm happy about your words. I would like to keep trying my best!<br/><br/>&gt; When you say "an air conditioner," you are saying that there is more than one air conditioner, but only one is broken.<br/>I understand well. There are two air conditioners in my laboratory, and both of them will be repaired, so I think I should have said  "the air conditioners."
