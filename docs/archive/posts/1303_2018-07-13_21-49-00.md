# 【No. 1303】<strong><em>Ohana</strong></em> (お花 - One's Favorite)
<div class="date">Jul 13, 2018 21:49</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Previously, I introduced you to the phrase "ohana tsumi ni iku" (お花摘みに行く - I will go picking flowers) as a code word to mean that you have to go to the bathroom.<br/><br/>Besides, I found that the <strong><em>ohana</em></strong> (お花 - flower) itself is sometimes used as a code word among girls to mean one's favorite.<br/><br/>The kanji, <strong><em>hana</em></strong> (花), can be divided into three parts: '艹' 'イ,' and 'ヒ.'<br/><br/>Here, by tilting '艹,' it becomes like 'キ.'<br/><br/>Furthermore, by rearranging these three characters, it becomes 'ヒイキ,' which means one's favorite.<br/><br/>This is the reason that <strong><em>ohana</em></strong> (お花 - flower) means <strong><em>hiiki</em></strong> (ヒイキ - one's favorite).<br/><br/>【Example sentence】<br/>"Ano ko wa, sensei no ohana yo" (あの子は先生のお花よ - She is the teacher's favorite.)

お花<br/><br/>以前私は、女性がトイレに行くことの隠語として「お花摘みに行く」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>そして今日私は、「お花」自体が女子学生の間で「贔屓」の隠語として使われることがあるということを知りました。<br/><br/>「花」という漢字は、「サ」「イ」「ヒ」の3つに分けることができます。<br/><br/>「サ」を傾けると「キ」になります。<br/><br/>そして3つの文字を並び替えると「ヒイキ」になります。<br/><br/>これが、「お花」が「贔屓」を意味する理由だそうです。<br/><br/>【使用例】<br/>「あの子は、先生のお花よ」

<p class="correction_comment">This sentence subtly indicates (with besides, and also "I found" which emphasizes the moment of discovery) that this discovery occurs at about the same time as the previous sentence. Ideally, you would write a sentence that more clearly indicates when in time you learned this alternate meeting of the word. When you wrote your entry? Previously? <br/><br/>I also wouldn't use "besides" as a transition here. "Additionally" might read more naturally.</p>

 Really interesting entry! My only comment is a slightly subtle point that has more to do with implied meaning than with grammar.

Thank you so much for the corrections! :)<br/>&gt; Ideally, you would write a sentence that more clearly indicates when in time you learned this alternate meeting of the word.<br/>I will try to write that in the days ahead. By the way, I learned the code word when searching for the yesterday's topic.

Ah, understood. In that case, one option for a transition would be as follows: "I recently discovered another slang term which uses 'ohana' in a different way:..." Very often in English, following a narrative continuity is quicker and easier for people to understand than a thematic continuity. Even academic or journalistic writing which is explicitly about themes and the meanings of things will often be delivered in terms of a narrative. This is why you so often see narrative nonfiction, where the journalist will give the chronology of their discovery process. I get the sense that this tendency is more overwhelming in English than in Japanese nonfiction writing, but maybe I'm totally mistaken about that?

I'm sorry, it was difficult for me to understand the difference between a narrative continuity and a thematic continuity. But I think that probably the narrative continuity tends to be used more in English than in Japanese.
