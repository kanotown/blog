# 【No. 1790】<strong><em>Hatodokei</strong></em> (鳩時計 - Cuckoo Clock)
<div class="date">Mar 21, 2021 18:47</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Hatodokei</strong></em><br/><br/>These days, I want to buy a <strong><em>hatodokei</em></strong> (鳩時計).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>hato</em></strong> (鳩) means "dove" and <strong><em>tokei/dokei</em></strong> (時計) means "clock," so the literal meaning of <em>hatodokei</em> is "dove clock." However, it is refered to as "cuckoo clock" in English and "kuckucksuhr" in German.<br/><br/>A cuckoo clock is a clock that strikes the hours with a cuckoo's call and was first made around 1750 in the Black Forest area in Germany.<br/><br/>After World War II, cuckoo clocks began to be produced in Japan.<br/><br/>Because cuckoos are not auspicious very much in Japan, cuckoo clocks were launched under the name <em>hatodokei</em>.

鳩時計<br/><br/>私は今、鳩時計を購入したいと考えています。<br/><br/>「鳩」は "dove"、「時計」は "clock" を意味するので、「鳩時計」の文字どおりの意味は "dove clock" となりますが、英語では "cuckoo clock"、ドイツ語では "kuckucksuhr" と呼ばれます。<br/><br/>鳩時計はカッコウの鳴き声で時刻を知らせてくれる時計で、1750年頃にドイツの黒い森と呼ばれるシュヴァルツヴァルト地方で作られました。<br/><br/>鳩時計は、戦後、日本でも生産されるようになりました。<br/><br/>しかし、日本では閑古鳥を意味するカッコウはあまり縁起が良くないということで、平和の象徴でもある「鳩」を製品名に使うようになったそうです。

<li class="incorrect">Since 'hato' (鳩) means "dove" and 'tokei/dokei' (時計) means "clock," so the literal meaning of 'hatodokei' is "dove clock." However, it is refered to as "cuckoo clock" in English and "Kuckucksuhr" in German.</li>

<p class="correction_comment">You can't use "so" and "since" in the same sentence like this. <br/>It would be like saying 「「鳩」は ""、「時計」は "clock" を意味するので、「鳩時計」の文字どおりの意味は "" となるからです」in Japanese. Doesn't make any sense.</p>

 Good example of the importance of localization. ^^

Thank you very much for the correction!<br/><br/>&gt; ... Doesn't make any sense.<br/>Oh, I completely forgot to add the meaning I looked up in the dictionary. Thank you for letting me know that. :)

Sure thing! Just to be clear, I was referring to the usage of "since" and "so" in the same sentence. Just copied and pasted your Japanese text as an example. ^^
