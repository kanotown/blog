# 【No. 0795】<strong><em>Yakan</em></strong> (Kettle)
<div class="date">Feb 20, 2017 11:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about a tool called "yakan."<br/><br/>Yakan is a kettle-shaped tool that is used for boiling water.<br/>(Incidentally, my dictionary says "yakan" is "kettle" or "boiler.")<br/><br/>Stainless, steel, aluminum or copper is often used as a material.<br/><br/>The yakan, which appeared in the Kamakura Period, was originally used to simmer drugs.<br/><br/>Therefore, the name became "yakan" -- <em>ya</em> means <em>medicine</em> and <em>kan</em> means <em>pod</em>.<br/><br/>It is not clear when yakan came to be used a tool for boiling water.<br/><br/>The roots of huetsuki yakan (kettle with whistle) that are often used these days seems to be ones that were released by a kitchenware manufacturer in New York in 1921.

やかん<br/><br/>今日は「やかん」という道具を紹介します。<br/><br/>「やかん」は、湯を沸かすために用いられる、土瓶型の道具です。<br/><br/>素材はステンレスやアルミニウム、銅、真鍮などであることが多いです。<br/><br/>鎌倉時代に登場したやかんは、もともと薬を煮出すために使われました。<br/><br/>このため、薬鑵（やっかん：薬の器）という名前になりました。<br/><br/>やかんがいつ頃から湯沸かしの道具として用いられるようになったかは、定かではありません。<br/><br/>現在よく見られる笛付きやかんのルーツは、ニューヨークの台所用品メーカーが1921年に発売したものが最初とされています。
