# <strong><em>Gotaku wo Naraberu</strong></em> (Give a Song and Dance )
<div class="date">May 27, 2017 18:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Woman: "Why were you late for our date today?"<br/><br/>Man: "Yesterday, I played a game until midnight after work. The game is an online game, and I played with my friends. You know, we have to cherish friends, right? <br/>It also can release stress of my work. Although I played the game, I got up early in the morning. Believe me. However, it was hard to decide my hairstyle..."<br/><br/>Woman: "Enough. Don't line up gotaku (Don't give me a song and dance)!"<br/><br/>The idiom "gotaku wo naraberu" means to say selfish reasons in a snobbish manner like this man.<br/><br/>"Gotaku" is an abbreviation for "gotakusen," which means to say someone's thought as if it were a statement of God, and "naraberu" means to "line up something."<br/><br/>In such a case, you should say sorry first instead of lining up gotaku.

御託を並べる<br/><br/>女性「今日のデート、なんで遅刻したの？」<br/><br/>男性「昨日仕事の後、夜遅くまでゲームしていたんだ。ゲームと言ってもオンライン通信対戦で、友達付き合いというのもあるし、仕事の疲れを癒すためにも必要なものだしね。それでも朝、頑張って起きたんだよ。だけど、なかなか髪型が決まらなくてさ。」<br/><br/>女性「もういい。御託を並べないで。」<br/><br/>「御託を並べる」という言葉は、この男性のように「自分勝手な理屈をえらそうにくどくど言うこと」を意味します。<br/><br/>「御託」は「御託宣」の略で、人が考えた勝手な理屈を、あたかも神のお告げのように言いふらすことを表します。<br/><br/>御託を並べるのはやめて、素直に謝りましょう。
