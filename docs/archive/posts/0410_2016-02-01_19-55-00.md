<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, a research hearing was held as the final examination of my doctoral course.<br/><br/>In accordance with the rules of the course, I had to perform my presentation in English.<br/><br/>To make the presentation successful, I recorded my voice and practiced many many times.<br/><br/>An a result, although the question-and-answer session was very hard, I got over this day.<br/><br/>After that, the examination meeting was held, then I seemed to pass the test.<br/><br/>I'm very pleased about it.<br/><br/>Only if I modify a part of my thesis and align some documents, I can graduate from my doctoral course!

博士の最終試験<br/><br/>今日は博士の最終試験として、公聴会が行われました。<br/><br/>コースの規定で、発表は英語で行わなければなりません。<br/><br/>発表を成功させるために、何度も自分の声を録音し、練習しました。<br/><br/>そして本番、質疑応答のセクションが大変でしたが、なんとか乗り切ることができました。<br/><br/>その後の審査会議の結果、試験は無事通過したようです。<br/><br/>とても嬉しいです。<br/><br/>後は書類を揃えて論文を一部修正すれば、博士過程を卒業できます！
