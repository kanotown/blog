<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Abura ga Noru</strong></em> (Putting on Fat)</h1>
<div class="date">Jan 27, 2017 11:01</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese idiom "abura ga noru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to put on fat," and it means that someone gets into the full swing of his/her work, or someone is in the prime as a man/woman.<br/><br/>Usage example: Recently his work has put on fat (he has gotten into the full swing of his work). It is said that men put on fat (men are in the prime of manhood) at around age 35.<br/><br/>Originally, this idiom has been used for fish or birds.<br/><br/>The amount of fat included in fish and birds increases depending on the season, then the taste improves.<br/><br/>From this fact, "abura ga noru" (to put on fat) came to mean that something/someone gets better.

脂が乗る<br/><br/>今日は「脂が乗る」という慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>「脂が乗る」は、仕事や勉強が調子に乗ってはかどることや、男盛り、女盛りであることを表す言葉です。<br/><br/>例：彼は最近ようやく仕事に油が乗ってきた。男性は35歳頃に油が乗ると言われている。<br/><br/>もともとこの言葉は、魚や鳥に対して使われる言葉でした。<br/><br/>魚や鳥は、季節によって脂肪が増え（脂が乗り）、味が良くなります。<br/><br/>このため、「脂が乗る」は調子が良くなるという意味で使われるようになりました。
