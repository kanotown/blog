# 【No. 0773】If you cut your nails at night...
<div class="date">Jan 29, 2017 10:19</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about a Japanese superstition.<br/><br/>"Yoru ni tsume wo kiru to oya no shinime ni aenai" (If you cut your nails at night, you won't be with your parents when they pass away).<br/><br/>Like this, it is thought that to cut your nails at night is something bad in Japan.<br/><br/>I will introduce two theories that are thought of as the derivation.<br/><br/>【Because it was dangerous】<br/>Formerly in Japan, people cut their nails using a small knife. Furthermore, since there were no light bulbs, it was very dark at night. As a result, some cut their hands wrongly and some were dead because of the mistakes.<br/><br/>【Because it could bring bad luck】<br/>By omitting "yoru ni tsume wo kiru" (to cut your nails at night), it becomes "夜爪 (yozume)," (night nails). This is associated with "世詰め (yozume)," which means "short-lived."

夜に爪を切ると<br/><br/>今日は日本の有名な迷信を紹介します。<br/><br/>「夜に爪を切ると親の死に目に会えない」<br/><br/>日本ではこのように、夜に爪を切ることは良くないことだとされています。<br/><br/>この理由として考えられている二つの説を紹介します。<br/><br/>【危険だったから】<br/>かつての日本では、小刀で爪を切っていました。さらに、電球が無く、夜はろうそくなどが用いられたため、とても暗かったです。その結果、間違って手を切ってしまい、それが原因で死んでしまったことがあったそうです。<br/><br/>【縁起が悪いから】<br/>「夜に爪を切る」を省略すると、「夜爪」となり、これは「世詰め」を連想させます。「世詰め」は「短命」を意味します。
