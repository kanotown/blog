# 【No. 2193】<strong><em>Yanagi ni Kaze</strong></em> (柳に風 - Warding Off)
<div class="date">Oct 23, 2023 14:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Yanagi ni Kaze</strong></em><br/><br/>People who do not oppose others and smoothly ward things off are sometimes described as <strong><em>yanagi ni kaze</em></strong> (柳に風).<br/><br/><br/>Since <strong><em>yanagi</em></strong> (柳) means "willow," and <strong><em>kaze</em></strong> (風) means "wind," the literal meaning of <em>yanagi ni kaze</em> is "wind against willows."<br/><br/>Willows have long, thin, drooping branches and leaves, and even when a strong wind blows, they sway flexibly and let the wind pass through.<br/><br/>This nature of the willow has given <em>yanagi ni kaze</em> its current meaning.<br/><br/>This idiom is sometimes cited as life's tips for navigating difficulties well.

柳に風<br/><br/>相手に逆らわずにうまく受け流す人のことを、「柳に風」と表現することがあります。<br/><br/>「柳」は ""、「風」は "" を意味するので、「柳に風」の文字どおりの意味は "" となります。<br/><br/>柳は細長く垂れた枝と葉を持っており、強い風が吹いても、しなやかになびいて、受け流します。<br/><br/>このような柳の性質から、「柳に風」は現在の意味を持つようになったというわけです。<br/><br/>この慣用句は「人生のコツ」としてしばしば引用されます。
