<div class="date">Feb 3, 2016 10:24</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will introduce how to get on and off trains in Japan.<br/><br/>There are many types of trains, but the ways to get on and off them are divided into three types.<br/><br/>In cities like Tokyo or many other regions, doors of trains open and close automatically. <br/><br/>However, in the suburbs or the countryside (especially in cold regions), we have to open and close the doors by pushing buttons.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if the trains are old types, we have to open and close the doors by using our hands.<br/><br/>The reason why the opening and closing are performed manually is to improve the efficiency of heating and cooling by not leaving the doors open.<br/><br/>Also, the last person who was getting on or off the train has not to forget to close the door firmly.<br/><br/>Please be careful when you use these trains in Japan.

日本の電車<br/><br/>今日は、日本の電車について紹介します。<br/><br/>日本には様々な種類の電車が走っていますが、乗降の種類は大きく3つあります。<br/><br/>東京やのような都会やその他多くの地域では、電車の扉は自動で開閉します。<br/><br/>しかし郊外や田舎（特に寒冷地方）に行くと、ドアの開閉はボタンで行います。<br/><br/>さらに、古いタイプの電車だと、ドアの開閉は手で行います。<br/><br/>このように手動でドアの開閉を行うのは、扉を開けっ放しにしないことで冷暖房の効率をあげるためです。<br/><br/>また、最後に乗り降りした人は、扉をしっかりと閉めるのを忘れないようにしましょう。<br/><br/>これらの電車に乗る祭は注意して下さい。
