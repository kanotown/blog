# 【No. 0036】How to Pronounce Abbreviations
<div class="date">Jan 23, 2015 22:13</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned laws of how to pronounce abbreviations.<br/><br/>Firstly, if the abbreviation is composed of 2 characters, it should be pronounced in unabbreviated form.<br/><br/>For example, "i.e." is pronounced "that is," and "e.g." is pronounced "for example."<br/><br/>Secondly, if the abbreviation is composed of 3 characters, it should be pronounced each characters.<br/><br/>For example, "WHO," "TPP," "ODA," and "FBI."<br/><br/>Thirdly, if the abbreviation is composed of 4 or more characters, it should be pronounced literally.<br/><br/>For example, "NATO," "AIDS," "NASA," and "UNESCO."<br/><br/>However, there are many exceptions.<br/><br/>For example, "UCLA" is pronounced "yuu-see-el-ei," "MIT" is sometimes pronounced "mit."<br/><br/>I think the way of pronounce depends on its readability, understandability, and degree of coolness.

 I've never learnt these rules... you learn a new thing everyday, eh? But you're right, there are loads of exceptions.I think possibly the first one is more accurate as "if the abbreviation is in lower case letters, read it as a whole word", for example, "ltd." is always read as "limited", or "a.s.a.p." is read as "as soon as possible".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hope this helps!
