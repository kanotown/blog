# <strong><em>Chōda no Retsu</strong></em> (長蛇の列 - Very Long Line)
<div class="date">Aug 2, 2021 12:42</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Chōda no Retsu</strong></em><br/><br/>A very long line waiting for something can be described as <strong><em>chōda no retsu</em></strong> (長蛇の列) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>chō</em></strong> (長) means "long," <strong><em>da</em></strong> (蛇) means "scake," and <strong><em>retsu</em></strong> (列) means "line/queue," the literal meaning of <em>chōda no retsu</em> is "long snake's line."<br/><br/>This term was coined from the fact that a very long line looks like a big and long snake.<br/><br/>For example, you can say <strong><em>mōsho no tame, aisu-ya ni chōda no retsu ga dekita</em></strong> (猛暑のためアイス屋に長蛇の列ができた - "Due to the extremely hot day, many people lined up in front of the ice cream shop.").

長蛇の列<br/><br/>とても長々と続く行列のことを、「長蛇の列」といいます。<br/><br/>「長」は "long"、「蛇」は "snake"、「列」は "rowa" を意味するので、「長蛇の列」の文字どおりの意味は "long snake's line" となります。<br/><br/>長々と続く行列は、まるで大きくて長い蛇のようであることから、この表現が生まれました。<br/><br/>例えば、「猛暑のため、アイス屋に長蛇の列ができた」のように使うことができます。
