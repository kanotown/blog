# 【No. 2045】<strong><em>Kyūshi ni Isshō wo Eru</em></strong> (九死に一生を得る - Having a Narrow Escape)
<div class="date">May 28, 2023 12:02</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kyūshi ni Isshō wo Eru</em></strong><br/><br/>Have you ever survived a critical situation where the chances of survival were meager?<br/><br/>In such a situation, you can use the Japanese phrase <strong><em>kyūshi ni isshō wo eru</em></strong> (九死に一生を得る).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>kyū</em></strong> (九) means "nine," <strong><em>shi</em></strong> (死) means "death," <strong><em>isshō</em></strong> (一) means "one," <strong><em>shō</em></strong> (生) means "life," and <strong><em>eru</em></strong> (得る) means "to get," the literal meaning of this phrase is "to get one life out of nine deaths."<br/><br/>In other words, if the same situation were to occur ten times, you would be dead nine times and survive only once. It is miraculous that you survived this time.

九死に一生を得る<br/><br/>ほとんど助かる見込みのない危機的状況から助かったことはありますか？<br/><br/>そのようなとき、「九死に一生を得る」というフレーズを使うことができます。<br/><br/>「九」は "nine"、「死」は "death"、「一」は "one"、「生」は "life"、「得る」は "to get" を意味するので、「九死に一生を得る」の文字どおりの意味は "to get one life out of nine deaths" となります。<br/><br/>同じことが10回あったら、9回は死んでいて、助かるのは1回のみであり、今回は奇跡的に助かったというわけです。
