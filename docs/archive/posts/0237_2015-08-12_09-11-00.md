# '歳' and '才'
<div class="date">Aug 12, 2015 09:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to introduce the Kanji, '歳（さい） and '才（さい）.'<br/><br/>Both of them are often used in the sense of <em>age,</em> for example, "20歳（20才）" means "twenty years old."<br/><br/>However, only '歳' is the precise kanji as the meaning of 'age.'<br/><br/>In fact, '才' means <em>talent</em> of 'ability.'<br/><br/>A common point of these kanji was how to read it.<br/><br/>Since '才' is more easy to write, we got to use it as a abbreviation of '歳'.<br/><br/>However, '才' is just an abbreviation, so we should use '歳' in the formal situation.
