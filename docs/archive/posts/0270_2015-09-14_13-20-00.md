# Unmanned Sales of Vegetables
<div class="date">Sep 14, 2015 13:20</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In countrysides of Japan, you can see that vegetables are being sold in the open air.<br/><br/>Vegetables are arranged, and prices are written, but there are no sales person.<br/><br/>If you want to buy the vegetables, you have to put your money into the box placed near them.<br/><br/>Since no labor cost is needed, you can buy vegetables inexpensively.<br/><br/>I think such unmanned sales imply good public safety and order of Japan.<br/><br/>However, unfortunately there seems to be some Japanese people who take vegetables without paying money.

野菜の無人販売<br/><br/>日本の田舎では、野外で野菜が無人販売されている光景を目にします。<br/><br/>野菜が並べられていて、値段が書かれていますが、販売員はいません。<br/><br/>野菜を購入した場合は、お金を近くに置いてある箱に入れます。<br/><br/>人件費がかからないので、とても安い値段で購入することができます。<br/><br/>私は、野菜の無人販売は治安の良さを示唆していると思います。<br/><br/>しかし残念ながら、お金を払わず野菜を持っていく日本人もいるようです。

<p class="correction_comment">I don't think "however" is needed since unfortunately already contradicts what previous sentence says. You also don't need "people" since "Japanese" can mean the language or people, but depends on context. In this context, it means people.</p>
