<div class="date">Apr 28, 2023 17:33</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Sankan Shion</strong></em><br/><br/>Recently, warm and cold days have been repeated every few days.<br/><br/>Such a climate seen from winter to spring is called <strong><em>sankan shion</em></strong> (三寒四温).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>san</em></strong> (三) means "three," <strong><em>kan</em></strong> (寒) means "cold," <strong><em>shi</em></strong> (四) means "four," and <strong><em>on</em></strong> (温) means "warm," the literal meaning of this four-character idiom is "three cold (days) and four warm (days)."<br/><br/>In other words, three warm days will be after three cold days.<br/><br/>Originally, this is a proverb that describes the features of the winter climate in northeastern China and the Korean Penisula, whereas such a climate is seen only once a year or less in Japan.

三寒四温<br/><br/>最近、数日ごとに温かい日と寒い日が繰り返されています。<br/><br/>冬から春にかけて見られるこのような気候のことを、「三寒四温」と言います。<br/><br/>「三」は "three"、「寒」は "cold"、「四」は "four"、「温」は "warm" を意味するので、「三寒四温」の文字通りの意味は "three cold and four warm (days)" となります。<br/><br/>3日ほど寒い日が続くと、その後4日ほど温かい日が続くということです。<br/><br/>もともとは中国東北部や朝鮮半島で冬季に見られる天候の特徴を表したことわざであり、日本でこのような気候の変化は年に1回あるかどうかという程度です。
