<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Dō ni Iru</strong></em><br/><br/>The Japanese idiom <strong><em>dō ni iru</em></strong> (堂に入る) refers to achieving proficiency in a study or skill.<br/><br/>This idiom is short for <strong><em>dō ni nobori te shitsu ni iru</em></strong> (堂に昇りて室に入る), which originated in the Analects of Confucius.<br/><br/><strong><em>Dō</em></strong> (堂) means "front room," <strong><em>nobori/noboru</em></strong> (昇り/昇る) means "to go up," <strong><em>shitu</em></strong> (室) means "inner room," and <strong><em>iru</em></strong> (入る) means "to enter," making literal meaning of this phrase "to go up to the front room and enter the inner room."<br/><br/>In other words, the idea is that one's knowledge or skills have reached not just the superficial level but also a profound region.<br/><br/>In the Analects, the latter part is phrased as <strong><em>shitu ni irazu</em></strong> (室に入らず) in a negative context, which means that one's knowledge or skills have not reached a profound region.

堂に入る<br/><br/>学問や技術が申し分のないほどに習熟していることを、「堂に入る」と言います。<br/><br/>「堂に入る」は、論語に由来する「堂に昇りて室に入る」という表現を省略した慣用句です。<br/><br/>「堂」は「表座敷 ("front room")」、「昇る」は "to go up"、「室」は「奥の間 ("inner room")」、「入る」は "to enter" を意味するので、「堂に昇り室の入る」の文字どおりの意味は "" となります。<br/><br/>学問や技術が、表面的な部分だけでなく、奥深いところまで達しているというわけです。<br/><br/>論語の中では、後半部分が「室に入らず」と否定文になっており、「学問や技術が奥深くまでは達していない」という意味で使われていました。

<p class="correction_comment">This is okay, though I think "profound region" sounds a bit odd. Another possibility would be "one's knowledge or skills have reached past the surface and arrived at a deeper level."</p>
