# 【No. 0712】Tachi Ojo
<div class="date">Nov 29, 2016 16:25</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese term "tachi ojo".<br/><br/>"Tachi" means "to stand", "ojo" means "to die", so "tachi ojo" refers to "to die while standing."<br/><br/>Yesterday I talked about "Benkei".<br/><br/>It is believed that Benkei was shot by a lot of arrows from surroundings in the battle of Koromogawa, and he died while standing supported by his long halberd called naginata.<br/><br/>From this story, "tachi ojo" can also refer to a state that someone is incapable of moving or something is dead-end.<br/><br/>By the way, I found that "Benkei's tachi ojo" was translated into "the last stand of Benkei" in English on the Internet.

立ち往生<br/><br/>今日は「立ち往生」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「往生」は「死ぬこと」であるため、「立ち往生」は「立ったまま死ぬこと」を意味します。<br/><br/>昨日、私は弁慶について話しました。<br/><br/>弁慶は衣側の戦いで前後から無数の矢を受け、薙刀を支えに立ったまま死んだと言われています。<br/><br/>これが転じて、「立ち往生」は「身動きが取れない状態」や「何かが行き詰った状態」も表します。<br/><br/>「弁慶の立ち往生」は英語で "the last stand of Benkei" と表すようです。

<p class="correction_comment">OR: By the way, while researching online I discovered that "Benkei's tachi mojo" is translated as "The last stand of Benkei" in English. [a bit more natural, to my ears] <br/><br/>We might also commonly say: Benkei's Last Stand.</p>
