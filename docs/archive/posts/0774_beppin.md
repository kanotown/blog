# 【No. 0774】<strong><em>Beppin</em></strong> (A Beautiful Woman)
<div class="date">Jan 30, 2017 00:07</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese word "beppin," which means a beautiful woman.<br/><br/>It is said that this word comes from a signboard of an eel restaurant in Aichi Prefecture.<br/><br/>During the Edo period, eel dishes came to be popular, and the restaurant hung out a sign that was written as "sukoburu beppin," which means "very different item."<br/><br/>(Here "beppin" is an abbreviation for "betsu no shina," which means "other item.")<br/><br/>This changed to just "beppin," and came to be used to mean an outstanding person.<br/><br/>And now it is used as a word that means only a beautiful woman.

べっぴん<br/><br/>今日は「美人」を意味する「べっぴん」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、愛知県にあるうなぎ屋の看板に由来すると言われています。<br/><br/>うなぎが流行りだした江戸時代、この店では特別な品があるという意味で「頗別品（すこぶるべっぴん）」という看板を掲げていました。<br/><br/>これが単に「別品」となり、やがて優れた人物を指す言葉としても用いられるようになりました。<br/><br/>そして現在では、女性の容姿のみを指す言葉として使われます。

 The words I changed are more suggestions than corrections. Your writing didn't have any real errors per se, but I think these changes would make it slightly more natural.

 Do people still use this word? It sounds very Showa Era to me.

Yes, Japanese people use this word. I sometimes hear it on TV shows. However, your sense might be right in a way. Young people don't use this word very much.
