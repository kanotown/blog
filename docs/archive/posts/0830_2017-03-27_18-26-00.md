諸刃の剣<br/><br/>今日は「諸刃の剣」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「諸刃」は「両側に刃がついていること」を意味し、「諸刃の剣」は「一方ではとても役に立つが、他方では大きな損害をもたらす危険があること」を意味します。<br/><br/>どちらの縁にも刃がついている剣は、自分自身を傷つけてしまう恐れがあることに由来します。<br/><br/>日本の国民的RPGであるドラゴンクエストでは、武器として「もろはのつるぎ」が登場するため、多くの日本人にとってこの言葉はなじみがあります。<br/><br/>この武器は高い攻撃力を有しますが、与えたダメージの一部が自分に返ってきます。<br/><br/>ちなみに、英語の "double-edged sword" も日本語の「諸刃の剣」も聖書の一節から来ているそうです。
