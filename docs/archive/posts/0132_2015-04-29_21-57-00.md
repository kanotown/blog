<div class="date">Apr 29, 2015 21:57</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I ate natto.<br/>今日は納豆を食べました。<br/><br/>Since I really like natto, I eat it almost everyday.<br/>私は納豆が大好きで、毎日のように食べています。<br/><br/>Some people might not like the smell, but natto, which includes rich nutrients such as calcium and vitamins, has great benefits for our health.<br/>匂いが苦手な方もいるかもしれませんが、納豆はカルシウムやビタミンなど体に必要な栄養素が豊富に含まれている、とても健康に良い食品です。<br/><br/>Biotin contained in natto makes healthy hair and skin, and removes fatigue of our body.<br/>納豆に含まれるビオチンは、健康な髪や皮膚を作り、体の疲れを取り除きます。<br/><br/>Nattokinase contained in natto dissolves blood clots, and improves blood flow.<br/>納豆に含まれるナットウキナーゼは、血栓を溶かし、血液をサラサラにします。<br/><br/>Polyamine contained in natto improves metabolism, and helps prevent aging.<br/>納豆に含まれるポリアミンは、新陳代謝や老化防止に効果があります。<br/><br/>Natto lecithin included in natto has a detox effect.<br/>納豆に含まれる納豆レシチンは、デトックス効果があります。<br/><br/>Isoflavone included in natto regulates a balance of female hormone, and makes bone stronger.<br/>納豆に含まれるイソフラボンは、女性ホルモンのバランスを整えたり、骨を丈夫にする効果があります。<br/><br/>Calcium included in natto makes bone thick, and keeps our health.<br/>納豆に含まれるカルシウムは、骨を太く、健康に保ちます。<br/><br/>Protein included in natto supples muscles of a heart and blood vessels, and helps absorption of calcium.<br/>納豆に含まれるタンパク質は、心臓や血管の筋肉をしなやかにしたり、カルシウムの吸収を助ける効果があります。<br/><br/>However, since natto includes also purines, eating too much natto could become a cause of gout.<br/>しかし、プリン体も含まれているので、あまり食べ過ぎると痛風の原因になります。<br/><br/>Also, when you stirred natto about 300 times, the amount of the natto's amino acid increases about 2.5 times, and the natto's ingredient increases about 4 times.<br/>また、納豆は300回かき混ぜると、アミノ酸の量が2.5倍に、甘み成分の量が約4倍になります。<br/><br/>Let's stir natto well and enjoy eating natto.<br/>よくかき混ぜて、みんなで納豆を食べましょう。

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/>Natto is produced by fermenting soybeans with bacillus subtilis natto.
