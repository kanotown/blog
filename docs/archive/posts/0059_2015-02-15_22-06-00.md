<h1 id="subject_show">Nabe Dishes</h1>
<div class="date">Feb 15, 2015 22:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　　Today, I cooked a nabe dishes. A nabe means a pot, and also means a Japanese cuisine similar to stew. This dish is really simple to cook, because all we have to do is putting various foods in a pot and boiling them. Today, I put Chinese cabbage, Welsh onion, bean curd, velvet shank, chicken and pork in an earthen pot and boiled them using a chicken based soup. It was really simple taste and delicious, also it made me warmed. Furthermore, it is good for health. In Japanese winter, we can't spend comfortably without nabe dishes.

Thank you very much for correcting me!<br/><br/>&gt; is an earthen pot the same as a clay pot?I searched earthen pot on Google, but I don't think it's for cooking.<br/><br/>An earthen pot (土鍋 or どなべ) is a Japanese traditional cookware made from earth.<br/>My dictionary said "earthen pot" means "donabe," but I think I should have use "donabe" instead of "earthen pot." If it is possible, please search for "土鍋" or "土鍋　水炊き" on Google Image Search. I think cooking images will appear.
