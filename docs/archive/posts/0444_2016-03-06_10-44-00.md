<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In recent years, doing desk work while standing up has got a lot of attention.<br/><br/>By standing up constantly, you can improve your posture and blood circulation of your feet.<br/><br/>Also, you can continue to concentrate, and won't become sleepy.<br/><br/>Of course it will make you tired, but you also will divide your break from your work sharply.<br/><br/>On the other hand, people who sit for a long time every day seem to have back pain and stiff shoulder, because of decline of muscle for supporting your hip.<br/><br/>Furthermore, they have higher risks about heart disease due to poor circulation and diabetes due to insulin decrease.<br/><br/>I might consider a purchase of a standing desk for my new workplace.

スタンディングデスク<br/><br/>近年、立ちながらデスクワークをすることが注目を浴びています。<br/><br/>常に立つことで、姿勢が良くなり、足の血行も良くなるそうです。<br/><br/>また、常に集中力が保たれ、眠くなりません。<br/><br/>立つことで当然疲れますが、作業と休憩の間にメリハリが生まれるとも言われています。<br/><br/>一方、長時間座る人は、腰を支える筋が衰え、腰痛や肩こりになりやすいそうです。<br/><br/>また、血行不良による心臓病や、インスリン減少による糖尿病のリスクが上昇するようです。<br/><br/>私も来月からの新しい職場では、スタンディングデスクを検討してみようと思います。
