しゃかりき<br/><br/>何かに懸命に取り組むことや、奮闘することを「しゃかりき」と言います。<br/><br/>「しゃかりき」は「釈迦」と「力」と組み合わせてできた言葉だと考えられています。<br/><br/>「釈迦」は "Buddha," 「力」は "power" を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち「しゃかりき」は、釈迦が人々の幸せのために力を尽くしたことに由来する表現、もしくは釈迦の力の大きさに人々が畏怖の念を覚えたことに由来する表現というわけです。<br/><br/>ときどき「がむしゃら」と混同されますが、「やけくそ」の意味を含む「がむしゃら」とはニュアンスが違います。<br/><br/>【例文】<br/>しゃかりきになって勉強する。

It is thought that shakariki was made by <span class="sline">composing</span> <span class="f_red">combining </span>two words: shaka (釈迦) and riki (力).
<p class="correction_comment">I thought the word "combining" may be a better fit for this sentence. The word "composing" is a good word, but it feels more natural to use this word when describing the creation of music, art, and poetry. For example, in the sentences: "John Keats is know for composing many romantic poems" and "Beethoven is known for composing beautiful, classical, piano music, but did you know that he was deaf?".</p>

<p class="correction_comment">I think this sentence may need more revision, so perhaps another Lang-8 user many offer a more useful correction. I crossed out possible, but I think "everything possible" and "everything in his power" could both be used, but using both terms together seems a little less natural.</p>
