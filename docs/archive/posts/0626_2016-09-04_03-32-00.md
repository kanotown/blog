# 【No. 0626】Hige
<div class="date">Sep 4, 2016 03:32</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "hige."<br/><br/>Hige means human's (especially man's) hair that grows above his upper lip (mustache), jaw (beard), or cheek (sideburn).<br/><br/>"髭" is often used as the kanji of "hige," but strictly speaking, "髭" means "mustache," "鬚" means "beard," and "髯" means "sideburn." <br/><br/>There are also three different words in English as well as the kanji.<br/><br/>The word "hige," which can show three different hair, seems to be unique to Japan.<br/><br/>By the way, it was considered that mustache bushi (Japanese samurai) in medieval Japan should grow their mustache, and bushi who have less mustache wore a false mustache.

ひげ<br/><br/>今日は「ひげ」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ひげ」は、人間（特に男性）の口の上、あご、ほおなどに生える毛を意味します。<br/><br/>漢字は「髭」が使われることが多いですが、くちひげは「髭」、あごひげは「鬚」、ほおひげは「髯」のように使い分けられます。<br/><br/>英語も同じように、それぞれ異なる英単語が存在します。<br/><br/>一つの「ひげ」という言葉でくちひげ、あごひげ、ほおひげを表す言葉は日本語特有のもののようです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、日本の中世において武士は髭を蓄えるべきとされ、髭の薄い武士は付け髭をつけていたそうです。

 One of my gr 6 students would routinely ask if I knew how to write the kanji for ひげ。 ... I wonder if he knew there were actually three different candidates.

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>I think that most Japanese people don't know there are three kanji for ひげ, because we usually use only "髭". If he knew three different kanji, it's amazing :)
