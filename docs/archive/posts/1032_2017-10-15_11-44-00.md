ナス<br/><br/>ナスという野菜は好きですか？<br/><br/>ナスはインド原産の野菜で、夏から秋にかけて栽培されます。<br/><br/>英語ではその形から、"eggplant" と呼ばれます。<br/><br/>かつての日本では「なすび」という呼び方が一般的でした。<br/><br/>「なすび」の語源には、いくつかの説があります。<br/><br/>その味から「中酸実」となり、「なすび」となったという説や、夏に実がなることから「夏実」となり、「なすび」となったという説が有名です。<br/><br/>正直に申しますと、私はナスの食感が苦手です。

 Eggplant is excellent chopped with other veggies in a tomato-based pasta sauce... :D

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>In this season, Japanese people often eat just grilled eggplants. I think that cooked eggplants containing in other dish like you said are better.

You're very welcome!<br/>Oh, that's interesting... grilled eggplants are usual in the Japanese autumn? It's cool actually... I'm going to eat grilled eggplant today XD<br/>Have a good one!

 I have corrected your sentences. Avoiding unnecessary commas is one sign that you have your sentence in the correct order and have avoided a fragmented sentence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I also assume that eggplant is not a vegetable because it has seeds. As you know, vegetables cannot have seeds.

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>Yes, eggplant has seeds, but interestingly it's usually regarded as "yasai" (野菜 - vegetable) in Japan. Thank you for letting me notice that. I will talk about that in today's entry.
