# 【No. 1108】<strong><em>Toshi no Se</em></strong> (年の瀬 - The End of the Year)
<div class="date">Dec 30, 2017 20:00</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The end of the year is sometimes referred to as 年の瀬 (toshi no se) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The 年 (toshi) means "year" and the 瀬 (se) means "shallow area of a river."<br/><br/>Since the flow of water becomes faster in the shallow area of the river, it's difficult to cross over there by ship.<br/><br/>On the other hand, many Japanese people in the Edo period often used money on deferred payments, and they settled these bills at the end of the year.<br/><br/>By comparing such a rush at the end of the year with a shallow area of a river, this term 年の瀬 (toshi no se) was born.

年の瀬<br/><br/>日本では、年末のことを「年の瀬」と表現することがあります。<br/><br/>ここで「瀬」とは、川の浅いところを意味する言葉です。<br/><br/>川の浅いところは、水の流れが早くなるため、船で渡ることが困難です。<br/><br/>一方、江戸時代の日本の生活ではつけ払いが多く、年末に未払いのものをまとめて精算していたようです。<br/><br/>このような精算の慌ただしさや大変さを川の瀬に例えて、年の瀬という言葉が生まれたとされています。
