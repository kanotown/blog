# The House of Councilors Election
<div class="date">Jul 10, 2016 12:42</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Since the House of Councilors election is being held today, I will tell you about three trivia that are related to Japanese elections.<br/><br/>【No. 1】<br/>In Japan, only a person who come to a polling station can confirm that there is no ballot in the ballot box. Some people seem to get up very early for confirming the ballot box.<br/><br/>【No. 2】<br/>When the number of a runner's votes is the same as another runner's one, the result will be eventually tolerated by lot. This way might be the same in many countries overseas.<br/><br/>【No. 3】<br/>Payments of Snacks/sweet treats for election staff are defined as up to a ceiling of 500 yen per day by law. Payments of bento (lunch bags) are up to 1000 yen per one meal.

参議院選挙<br/><br/>今日、日本では参議院選挙なので、選挙にちなんだ雑学を3つ紹介します。<br/><br/>【No. 1】<br/>日本では投票所に一番乗りした人は、投票箱に何も入っていないことを確認します。この確認をしたいがために、早起きして来る人が多いそうです。<br/><br/>【No. 2】<br/>獲得票数が同じだった場合は、最終的にくじ引きで決まります。これは他の国でも同じかもしれません。<br/><br/>【No. 3】<br/>日本の選挙員のおやつ代は、法律で一日500円までと決められています。弁当代は一食1000円までです。
