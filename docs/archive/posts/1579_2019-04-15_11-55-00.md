# 【No. 1579】<strong><em>Shame</strong></em> (写メ - Photo) Part 2
<div class="date">Apr 15, 2019 11:55</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Shame</strong></em> (写メ) Part 2<br/><br/>Yesterday, I introduced the slang term <strong><em>shame</em></strong> (写メ), which means to take photos with (or photos taken by) a mobile phone or smartphone.<br/><br/>If you want to use <em>shame</em> as a verb, you can say <strong><em>shame-ru</em></strong> (写メる) by adding the suffix <strong><em>ru</em></strong> (る).<br/><br/>For example, <strong><em>shame-rou</em></strong> (写メろう) means "let's take photos (with our smartphones)."<br/><br/>I often use and hear these terms, <em>shame</em> and <em>shame-ru</em>.<br/><br/>However, among the current young people, it seems that these slang terms are becoming dead words because they do not use e-mails very much.

写メ Part 2<br/><br/>昨日は「写メ」という俗語を紹介しました。<br/><br/>「写メ」を動詞として使う場合は、接頭辞「る」をつけて「写メる」のように言います。<br/><br/>例えば、「写メろう」のように言うことができます。<br/><br/>「写メ」も「写メる」も私はよく使ってきましたし、周りで使っている人も多くいます。<br/><br/>しかし現在の若者の間では、写真をメールに添付することや、メールをすること自体も減ってきていることから、「写メ」という言葉が死語になりつつあるようです。

 To be honest, for me, email as a tool of communication have always had an image of something you only use at work. Back in the day when I was younger we used ICQ, AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) etc. and their mobile counterparts, email was used only for formal matters.

It's been a while! :)<br/>Thank you so much for correcting my post and letting me know the interesting information!<br/>Actually, I didn't know these messenger services. When I was young, we used just e-mail for both formal and casual matters.

&gt;It's been a while! :)<br/>&gt;Thank you so much for correcting my post and letting me know the interesting information!<br/><br/>Ha! It's been a while indeed)<br/>You're welcome!<br/><br/>&gt;Actually, I didn't know these messenger services. When I was young, we used just e-mail for &gt;both formal and casual matters.<br/><br/>Oh, really. On the other hand I think that it's convenient when you have one communication tool that you can use both for work and leisure.
