大きなお世話<br/><br/>日本語には「大きなお世話」という言葉があります。<br/><br/>「大きな」は "big," 「お世話」は "care" や "favor" を意味します。<br/><br/>これを組み合わせた「大きなお世話」は、良い意味を持つと思われるかもしれません。<br/><br/>しかし、実際には「余計なお世話」「いらぬ世話」を意味し、相手の気遣いを拒む時に使われます。<br/><br/>さらに、皮肉の意味を込めて使われることが多いので、使う際には注意して下さい。<br/><br/>英語では "None of your business" や "Leave me alone" のように訳されます。

Thank you for the comment!<br/>Yes, it's not a good phrase, but it's sometimes regarded as a humorous response to a joke.<br/>For example:<br/>My mother: "I think you should have a girlfriend because you're already 30. Do you want me to help you find your girlfriend from my friends? Haha."<br/>Me: "It's ookina osewa!"
