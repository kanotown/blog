# A Little Cool Usage of "こと(koto)"
<div class="date">Nov 16, 2015 13:12</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will introduce a Japanese expression that I think is a little cool.<br/><br/>An example sentence is shown below:<br/><br/>「こと日本においては少子高齢化が問題となっている（In Japan in particular, the falling birth rate and the aging population have become a big problem.）」<br/><br/>The "こと（which is written as '殊' in kanji）" in this example means something like "in particular," and it emphasizes following words.<br/><br/>Actually, "特に (tokuni）" is often used in conversations as the meaning of "in particular", but I think it's cool if someone use "こと" or "殊に(kotoni)."

少しかっこいい「こと」の使い方<br/><br/>今日は、私が少しかっこいいと思う日本語の表現を紹介します。<br/><br/>以下に例文を示します。<br/><br/>「こと日本においては少子高齢化が問題となっている。」<br/><br/>ここでの「こと」は、漢字で書くと「殊」であり、「in particular」のような強調の意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>口頭では「特に」と言われることが多いですが、「こと」あるいは「殊に(ことに)」と言うとちょっとかっこいいと思います。

A Little Cool Usage of "こと(koto)"
<p class="correction_comment">A Little Cool Usage of "こと" (koto) - I believe the bracketed text should be outside the quotation marks. Also, for me the expression "little cool" sound unnatural. "A cool little use of koto" sounds better.</p>

 I don't understand why you prefer koto, but in terms of meaning what you wrote makes sense. It would be great to understand how these different expressions carry differences in meaning. Or is it only the sound? Be careful with where to end your quotation marks!

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>Ah, sorry. I forgot to write why I feel koto is cool. The reason is because it is a quite formal expression in Japan, and we can see it only in formal sentences or discourses.
