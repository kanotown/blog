プレミアムフライデー<br/><br/>昨日はプレミアムフライデーでした。<br/><br/>プレミアムフライデーは、日本政府と経済界が提唱する、新しい個人消費キャンペーンです。<br/><br/>具体的には、月末の金曜日には午後3時など早めに仕事を切り上げて、夕方から買い物や旅行を楽しんでもらうというものです。<br/><br/>この日、多くの飲食店や旅行会社がさまざまな割引キャンペーンを行いました。<br/><br/>昨日、2017年2月24日がプレミアムフライデーの初めての施行日で、これから2ヶ月に1回、1年に6回のペースで施行されます。<br/><br/>ちなみに昨日は15時から会議で、私には全く関係ありませんでした。
