刹那<br/><br/>我々が最も使う時間の単位は、秒、分、時などであり、これは世界共通です。<br/><br/>このような世界で一般的な単位とは別に、日本ではほんの一瞬を表現する際に「刹那」を使うことがあります。<br/><br/>「刹那」は仏教における時間の概念の一つで、極めて短い時間を表します。<br/><br/>定義は諸説ありますが、指をひとはじきする間に65刹那あるなどと言われています。<br/><br/>また、漢字文化圏では、10^-18という数の単位としても用いられています（実際に使われるケースはほとんどありません）。

Thank you for the comment :)<br/>Yes, if you use "刹那" effectively instead of other words such as "瞬間," it will be a cool/beautiful Japanese sentence.

Thank you so much for correcting my post! (^^)<br/><br/>&gt; I'm not sure I understand 指をひとはじき, so this could be wrong.<br/>The act called "指を弾く（ゆびをはじく）" is something like the following.<br/><object height="315" width="560">

<br/>I'm no sure but the verb "snap" might be more appropriate.

Huh, interesting.<br/><br/>I would call that a snap, but we usually snap with a different finger. Hmm.<br/><br/>It's interesting anyway! Thanks!
