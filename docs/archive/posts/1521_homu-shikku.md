# 【No. 1521】<strong><em>Hōmu shikku</em></strong> (ホームシック - Homesickness)
<div class="date">Feb 17, 2019 01:44</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Hōmu shikku</em></strong><br/><br/>Five days have passed since I came to Italy, and I am gradually becoming <strong><em>hōmu shikku</em></strong> (ホームシック).<br/><br/><em>Hōmu shikku</em> is a nostalgic feeling that you want to back to your hometown or home, and it comes from the English term "homesick."<br/><br/>However, note that "homesick" is an adjective, whereas <em>hōmu shikku</em> is a noun. (In other words, <em>hōmu shikku</em> can be translated as "homesickness.")<br/><br/>Incidentally, you can say <strong><em>kaikyō-byō</em></strong> (懐郷病) instead of <em>hōmu shikku</em>.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>kai</em></strong> (懐) means "nostalgia," <strong><em>kyō</em></strong> (郷) means "home/hometown," and <strong><em>byō</em></strong> (病) means "sick," the literal meaning of the combination is "a sick that you feel nostalgic about your home/hometown."

ホームシック<br/><br/>イタリアに来て5日が経ち、私は若干ホームシックになりつつあります。<br/><br/>「ホームシック」とは、家庭や故郷を懐かしむ心情のことで、英語の "homesick" から来ています。<br/><br/>ただし、英語の "homesick" は形容詞である一方、日本語の「ホームシック」は名詞として扱われます（すなわち英語の "homesickness" に対応します）。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「ホームシック」のことを「懐郷病」と言うこともできます。<br/><br/>「懐」は "nostalgia"、「郷」は "home/hometown"、「病」は "a sick that you feel nostalgic about your home/hometown" を意味するので、「懐郷病」の文字どおりの意味は "" となります。
