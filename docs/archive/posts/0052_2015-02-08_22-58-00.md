　Today, my boss and I checked master thesis presentations of my two juniors. Each presentation was 15 minutes, however, our comments and discussion took around 3 hours. Although we all got exhausted, my juniors had to make a thorough review of the points put forth by us after that. I want them to be rewarded eventually because they have been working hard.
