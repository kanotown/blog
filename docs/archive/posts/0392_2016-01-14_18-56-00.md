3つの出来事<br/><br/>昨日と今日で3つの出来事があったので、まとめて日記に書きます。<br/><br/>まず昨日、大学教員の内定を頂くことができました。<br/><br/>とても嬉しいです。<br/><br/>そして今日はTOEIC SWの試験を受けました。<br/><br/>話す練習をほとんどしてこなかったので、スピーキングが苦しかったです。<br/><br/>最後に、今日ついに12,000単語の学習が完了しました。<br/><br/>おおよそ200時間かかりました。<br/><br/>とても達成感がありますが、忘れている単語も多いので、また初めからやり直す予定です。<br/><br/>ちなみに、12m000番目の単語は「twitter」でした。<br/><br/>あるSNSのおかげでとても簡単な単語でした（笑）
