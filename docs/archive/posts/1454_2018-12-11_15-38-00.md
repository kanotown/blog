<div id="post_ja"><div id="body_show_mo">
居眠り<br/><br/>私は今日、ほんの数分程「居眠り」をしてしまいました。<br/><br/>「居眠り」とは、何かをしているときに（特に学校や職場などで）眠ってしまうことを意味する言葉です。<br/><br/>「居」は "stay," 「眠り」は "sleep" を意味するので、「居眠り」の文字どおりの意味は "a sleep while staying" となります。<br/><br/>「居眠り」は日本においてよく観察される慣習の一つとなっています。<br/><br/>これは、労働時間の増加、および睡眠時間の減少の結果であると考えられています。<br/><br/>英語では "snooze" や "doze" という単語で表現されます。

<li class="corrected correct">
Today, I did 'inemuri' (居眠り) for just a few minutes.
<p class="correction_comment">Okay, so there isn't anything technically wrong that I can tell here. However, if I were to say this to my friend, I would construct the sentence more like this, "For just a few minutes today, I inemuri-ed (居眠り).'<br/><br/>The reason is, sometimes when we transfer foreign words into English we throw English grammar on top of it to make it sound grammatically correct, even though it does not have an actual grammatical usage in the language. I don't know if there is a real rule for this but i see it sometimes.  and alternative way to construct the sentence if you did not want to throw some tricky English at the end of it might be 'For just a few minutes today I took a inemuri' (居眠り)' in this construction we are using inemuri' (居眠り) like we would use nap, which acts similarly as far as the grammar goes.<br/><br/>Sorry if that is more confusing then helpful.</p>
