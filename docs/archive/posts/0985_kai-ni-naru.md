# 【No. 0985】<strong><em>Kai ni Naru</em></strong> (貝になる - Saying Nothing)
<div class="date">Aug 29, 2017 09:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I often do "kai ni naru" (貝になる).<br/><br/>The "kai" (貝) means "shellfish," the "naru" (なる) means "become/be," so the literal meaning of "kai ni naru" is to become a shellfish.<br/><br/>Since shellfishes close their shells tightly, it's hard to open them.<br/><br/>Because of this, "kai ni naru" (becoming a shellfish) has come to mean to close your mouth and say nothing, just like a shellfish.<br/><br/>Incidentally, there is the Japanese movie and drama, titled "watashi ha kai ni naritai" (私は貝になりたい - I'd Rather Be a Shellfish).<br/><br/>I haven't watched them, but according to the Internet, the title "kai ni naritai" just literally means to want to be a shellfish living at the bottom of the sea.

貝になる<br/><br/>私は会議中、よく貝になります。<br/><br/>「貝」は "shell," 「なる」は "become" なので、「貝になる」の文字通りの意味は "to become a shell" です。<br/><br/>貝は硬い殻を閉ざして、なかなか開きません。<br/><br/>貝のように口を閉じ、口を開かない、すなわち発言をしないことを、「貝になる」と言います。<br/><br/>ちなみに、日本の映画・ドラマで「私は貝になりたい」というものがあります。<br/><br/>私はこの作品を見ていませんが、どうやらこのタイトルの「貝になりたい」は、純粋に海底に住む貝に生まれ変わりたいという意味のようです。

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; Is the Japanese movie BOTH a movie and drama?<br/>At first, the drama titled "私は貝になりたい" was created, and after that, the movie having the same title was created. Therefore both the movie and drama exist.

Ok, then. Your last sentence is correct.
