# 【No. 1098】How to Go to the Bathroom: Part 2
<div class="date">Dec 20, 2017 09:40</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I introduced you to a common expression that is used when you want to go to the bathroom.<br/><br/>Today I'd like to talk about other Japanese expressions implying that you will go to the bathroom.<br/><br/>*お花摘みに行く* (*ohana tsumi ni iku* - I will go picking flowers): This is an expression for women.<br/><br/>*雉撃ちに行く* (*kiji uchi ni iku* - I will go pheasant hunting): This is an expression for men.<br/><br/>Originally, it seems that these expression was used to imply urinating/defecating on climbing.<br/><br/>This is because the posture of urinating/defecating in the grass is similar to the posture of flower picking or pheasant hunting.

トイレへの行き方 Part 2<br/><br/>昨日は、トイレに行くときに使う一般的な表現を紹介しました。<br/><br/>今日は、その他のトイレに行くことをほのめかす表現を幾つか紹介します。<br/><br/>「お花摘みに行く」・・・女性が用を足しに行くことを意味する表現です。<br/><br/>「雉撃ちに行く」・・・男性が用を足しに行くことを意味する表現です。<br/><br/>これら表現は、登山において用を足しに行く際に使われていたことに由来するようです。<br/><br/>草花の中で用を足す姿は、花摘みや雉撃ちの際の姿勢と似ているためです。
