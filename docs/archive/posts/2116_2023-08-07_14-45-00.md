花火 Part 2<br/><br/>日本では「おもちゃ花火」も一般的です。<br/><br/>「おもちゃ」は "toy" を意味するので、「おもちゃ花火」の文字どおりの意味は "toy fireworks" となります。<br/><br/>おもちゃ花火の中でも、特に「線香花火」は儚くて美しいです。<br/><br/>「線香」は "incense stick" を意味するので、「線香花火」の文字どおりの意味は "incense stick fireworks" となります。<br/><br/>かつて、香炉に線香のように立てて遊んだことに由来するそうです（今は、先を下に向けて遊びます）。<br/><br/>線香花火は、少量の黒色火薬を用いた花火であり、時間経過・温度変化によってさまざまな燃え方の変化を楽しむことができます。

 It's been a long time since I've really gotten to enjoy fireworks. I used to love sparklers and "Roman candles" a lot. I've only seen senko hanabi in VRChat, so it wasn't real, of course. It's nice to know what they're called now, though.

I also would like to enjoy fireworks after a long time. "Roman candle" is a new term I never heard! It sounds exciting, but maybe a little too thrilling for me, haha. :)<br/>I hope you will enjoy real and beautiful 'senko hanabi' someday!
