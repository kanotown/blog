# 【No. 0831】<strong><em>Tedama ni Toru</em></strong> (To Lead Someone by the Nose)
<div class="date">Mar 28, 2017 07:43</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I'd like to talk about the Japanese idiom "tedama ni toru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to take tedama," and it means to lead or control someone as you wish.<br/><br/>Here "tedama" is a Japanese traditional toy, "otedama," which is made by putting azuki beans or rice into a small cloth bag, and sewing it.<br/><br/>"Otedama" also means a kind of games for girls -- they enjoy throwing some otedama straight up into the air with a certain rule or timing according to a song.<br/><br/>Since girls manipulated otedama at will, "tedama ni toru" (to take tedama) came to mean "to lead/control someone."

手玉に取る<br/><br/>今日は「手玉に取る」という日本の慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>「手玉に取る」は、人を思い通りに動かしたり、翻弄したりすることを表します。<br/><br/>ここで「手玉」とは、小さな布袋に小豆や米などを入れて縫い合わせた玩具、「お手玉」のことです。<br/><br/>「お手玉」は、歌に合わせて一定のルールやタイミングで、上に放り投げて楽しむのが一般的です。<br/><br/>この「お手玉」を少女たちが自由自在に操るようすから、「手玉に取る」は「人を翻弄する」という意味を持つようになりました。
