自動販売機の下<br/><br/>日本のテレビ番組の調査によると、自動販売機の下には、約10％の確率でお金が落ちているそうです。<br/><br/>実際に300台の自動販売機を調査したところ、2724円が見つかりました。<br/><br/>一台につき、平均9円のお金が落ちていることになります。<br/><br/>また、日本には約550万台の自動販売機が設置されています。<br/><br/>すなわち、日本の自動販売機の下には約5000万円が眠っていることになります。<br/><br/>ちなみに、何故か「日本には5150万台の自動販売機があり、4億6千万円が落ちている」というブログ記事が沢山ありました。<br/><br/>これは当然嘘で、人口の半分近くの自動販売機はさすがにありません。
