# 【No. 2152】<strong><em>Oshi</strong></em> (推し - My Fave): Part 1
<div class="date">Sep 12, 2023 12:26</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Oshi</strong></em><br/><br/>If you have a particular favorite member in an idol group or character in an anime, that is colloquially referred to as <strong><em>oshi</em></strong> (推し).<br/><br/><em>Oshi</em> is an abbreviation of <strong><em>oshimen</em></strong> (推しメン), which is short for <strong><em>oshiteiru member</em></strong> (推しているメンバー - meaning "member you are recommending") or <strong><em>ichioshi no member</em></strong> (一推しのメンバー - meaning "most recommended member").<br/><br/>In other words, <em>oshi</em> represents a member you like so much that you want to recommend them to someone else.<br/><br/>Incidentally, currently in Japan, an anime/manga called <strong><em>Oshi no Ko</em></strong> (推しの子 - literally "My Fave's Children") is becoming popular.

推し<br/><br/>アイドルグループやアニメにおけるキャラクターの中で、特にお気に入りのメンバーやキャラクターがいるとき、その対象を俗に「推し」と呼ぶことがあります。<br/><br/>「推し」は、「推しているメンバー」または「一推しのメンバー」の略語「推しメン」を、さらに省略したものと考えられています。<br/><br/>すなわち、誰かに推薦したくなるほどそのメンバーが好きであるということです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、現在日本では「推しの子」というアニメ/マンガが流行っています。

'Oshi' is an abbreviation of 'oshimen' (推しメン), which is short for 'oshiteiru member' (推しているメンバー - meaning "member you <span class="f_blue">want people to check out/recommend that people check out</span>") or 'ichioshi no member' (一推しのメンバー - meaning "the member you <span class="f_blue">like/want people to check out </span>the most").
<p class="correction_comment">"Recommend" in this case is vague and unclear so I've provided a suggestion. There is probably a more concise way to say it than what I wrote though....</p>

Thank you for the correction!<br/><br/>&gt; "Recommend" in this case is vague and unclear so I've provided a suggestion.<br/>Thank you for your suggestion! The original Japanese also contains vagueness, so a literal translation seems difficult. As another option, words like "push" or "top pick" might be used.

Fyi, "recommend" is vague because you need to specify what you're recommending them for. If you said to someone "I recommend him." Their response would probably be: "Huh? For what?" <br/><br/>You could use it in a professional setting like, "I recommend him for the job." for example. <br/><br/>But for an artist, it's better to say, "You should check him out/listen to him/watch his movies/etc." <br/><br/>Hope that makes sense!

Thank you for the explanations! I understand it well now.<br/><br/>Indeed, when considering a situation where 'oshi' is used in conversation, the phrase "You should check out/..." sounds like a natural translation. :)
