# 【No. 1529】<strong><em>Denka no Houtou</strong></em> (伝家の宝刀 - A Last Resort)
<div class="date">Feb 24, 2019 23:27</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Denka no Houtou</strong></em><br/><br/>A measure of last resort that you use in an emergency is referred to as <strong><em>denka no houtou</em></strong> (伝家の宝刀) in Japanese.<br/><br/><strong><em>Den</em></strong> (伝) means "tradition," <strong><em>ka</em></strong> (家) means "family" or "house," and the combination <strong><em>denka</em></strong> (伝家) means something that has been passed down in someone's family for generations.<br/><br/>In addition, <strong><em>hou</em></strong> (宝) means "treasure" and <strong><em>tou</em></strong> (刀) means "sword," so the literal meaning of <em>denka no houtou</em> is "a treasured sword that has been passed down in someone's family for generations."<br/><br/>Since such a sword of the heirloom is a strong weapon used in an emergency, this term came to have its current meaning.

伝家の宝刀<br/><br/>いざというときに出す、とっておきの切り札のことを、「伝家の宝刀」と言います。<br/><br/>「伝」は "tradition"、「家」は "family/house" を意味し、「伝家」で先祖代々その家に伝わることを意味します。<br/><br/>また、「宝」は "treasure"、「刀」は "sword" を意味するので、「伝家の宝刀」の文字通りの意味は "a treasured sword that has been passed down in someone's family for generations" となります。<br/><br/>家宝として代々伝えられてきた刀はいざというときに使う強力な武器であることから、「伝家の宝刀」は現在の意味を持つようになったというわけです。

 Nice writing! Can you give an example of how to use 伝家の宝刀 in a sentence?
</p>

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/><br/>For example, you can use 伝家の宝刀 as follows:<br/>あの野球選手は、ついに伝家の宝刀であるフォークボールを投げた。(That baseball player finally threw his trump card, a forkball.)
