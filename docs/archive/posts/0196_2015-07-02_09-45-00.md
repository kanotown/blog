<p class="correction_comment">James Evans did not invent the Inuktitut language however, he only invented the symbols used to write it, so it would be better to say something like:<br/><br/>"In order to express the languages of the Canadian Aboriginals, James Evans devised a script for Inuktitut in 1840."<br/><br/>A "script" can also refer to the alphabet or symbols that a language uses in writing.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">I think "speak" sounds more precise than "use" in this case, but "use" is okay.<br/><br/>"Recently" doesn't work here because this is not a sudden event or trend. These 30 thousand people have been speaking Inuktitut their entire lives. They did not just learn it all of a sudden.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">"Couldn't" might imply that you can understand it now.<br/><br/>Changed "excited" to "excite" so that the tense is the same. Otherwise, I might say "... but these characters excited me when I first saw them."</p>
