# 【No. 1875】<strong><em>Jūyaku Shukkin</strong></em> (重役出勤 - Fashionably Late)
<div class="date">Jun 14, 2021 19:39</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Jūyaku Shukkin</strong></em><br/><br/>Arriving at work much later than the opening time, or just being late, is commonly referred to as <strong><em>jūyaku shukkin</em></strong> (重役出勤) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>jūyaku</em></strong> (重役) means "executive" and <strong><em>shukkin</em></strong> (出勤) means "attendance," the literal meaning of <em>jūyaku shukkin</em> is "executives attendance."<br/><br/>This term was coined because executives do not have their working hours closely controlled by someone else, unlike regular employees.<br/><br/>In actual cases, this term is often used with a sarcastic nuance to someone who is late, such as "It's amazing that you can be as late as an executive."

重役出勤<br/><br/>始業時間よりも大幅に遅れて出勤することや、遅刻することを、俗に「重役出勤」といいます。<br/><br/>「重役」は "executive"、「出勤」は "attendance" を意味するので、「重役出勤」の文字どおりの意味は "executives attendance" となります。<br/><br/>重役は平社員とは異なり、就業時間を細かく管理されることがないため、このような言葉が生まれました。<br/><br/>実際には、遅刻をした人に対して、「重役でもないのに遅刻をするんだね」という嫌味のニュアンスを込めて使われることが多いです。
