# <strong><em>Munasawagi</strong></em> (胸騒ぎ - Bad Feeling)
<div class="date">Feb 5, 2018 20:54</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Have you ever felt that something bad would happen?<br/><br/>Such a state is called 胸騒ぎ (munasawagi) in Japanese.<br/><br/>胸 (mune) means "chest" and 騒ぎ (sawagi) means "romp," so the literal meaning of 胸騒ぎ is "one's chest romps."<br/><br/>The etymology is very simple -- if you have a bad feeling about something, you will feel tension and your heart beat faster as if the chest would romp.<br/><br/>These days, you can also say 胸騒ぎ when you're expecting good things and being excited.<br/><br/>Incidentally, this term is usually used like 胸騒ぎがする (munasawagi ga suru - I feel 'munasawagi'),.

胸騒ぎ<br/><br/>何か悪いことが起きると予感して興奮したことはありますか？<br/><br/>そのような状態のことを、日本語で「胸騒ぎ」と表現することがあります。<br/><br/>「胸」は "chest", 「騒ぎ」は "romp" を意味するので、「胸騒ぎ」の文字通りの意味は "one's chest romps" となります。<br/><br/>語源は単純で、嫌な予感で興奮しているときは、まるで胸が騒いでいるかのようのドキドキするからです。<br/><br/>最近では、期待で胸が高鳴ることも、「胸騒ぎ」と表現することがあります。<br/><br/>ちなみに、大抵の場合「胸騒ぎがする」の形で使われます。

 Is this similar to "doki doki suru"? Munasawagi, huh? I think I understand. Thank you very much, I've learned something new today!

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/><br/>&gt; Is this similar to "doki doki suru"? <br/>Yes, both have the similar meaning :)<br/>I think that "doki doki suru" implies a good sense, whereas "munasawagi" implies a bad sense.

Thank you so much for the suggestion!<br/>Hmm, as you said, maybe it's a little too strong. I think that "munasawagi" can be translated as "vague foreboding," "funny feeling," or "presentiment."
