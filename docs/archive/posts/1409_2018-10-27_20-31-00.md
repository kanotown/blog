<div class="date">Oct 27, 2018 20:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Narau yori Narero<br/><br/>In my university, education based on practice has been performed.<br/><br/>It is also important to learn from people and books, but if you want to acquire practical skills efficiently, you should gain practical experience.<br/><br/>There is a proverb that says this fact, <strong><em>narau yori nareyo</em></strong> (習うより慣れよ).<br/><br/><strong><em>Narau</em></strong> (習う) means "to learn" or "to study," <strong><em>nareru</em></strong> (慣れる) means "to get used to something," so the literal meaning of this proverb is "It is better to get used to it than learn it."<br/><br/>The similar fact can be described in English as "Practice makes perfect."

習うより慣れよ<br/><br/>私の大学では、実践に基づいた教育が行われています。<br/><br/>人や本から学ぶことも大事ですが、それよりも実践的な経験を重ねたほうが、よりよく技能を身につけることができます。<br/><br/>このことを表すことわざに、「習うより慣れろ」があります。<br/><br/>「習う」は "to learn" や "to study" を、「慣れる」は "to get used to" を意味するので、「習うより慣れよ」は "It is better to get used to it than learn it." という意味になります。<br/><br/>英語では "Practice makes perfect" のように表現されます。

 実践的な教育は、より多くの時間も費用を掛かるから、実現する大学はほどんどないと思います。

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/>確かに、実践的な教育は多くの時間と労力を使います。日本の工学系の大学 (engineering course)では、週に数時間程度だけ「演習 (Practice)」という名前で実践的な技術を学ぶケースが多いと思います。
