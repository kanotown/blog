今日は、喉がむずむずしました。<br/><br/>風邪かな、と思ったけれど、目も痒かったので、恐らくスギ花粉症です。<br/><br/>スギ花粉症は日本で最も多い花粉症で、約2,500万人（人口の約20％）が患っているとされています。<br/><br/>日本でスギ花粉症患者が多い理由は、戦後の復旧のため、大規模なスギの植林が行われたためです。<br/><br/>スギは成長率が高く建材としての価値も高いですが、大量の花粉が飛散するため、多くの日本人が花粉症になりました。<br/><br/>スギ花粉は、時には風に乗って、300km離れたところにも到達します。<br/><br/>そのため日本では、この時期の天気予報の際には、花粉情報もよく報じられます。<br/><br/>今年度からスギの伐採と同時に、花粉の少ない苗木への植え替えが進められていくそうなので、来年以降が待ちどおしいです。
