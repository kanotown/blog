今日、私は後輩達と一緒に千葉県へ旅行に来ました。<br/><br/>私達は朝5時に出発し、アクアラインの海底トンネルを通り、海ほたるPAで朝食を食べました。<br/><br/>アクアラインは千葉と東京を繋ぐ高速道路で、この海底トンネルは、世界最長です。<br/><br/>この海底トンネルを抜けると、人工島の海ほたるPAに辿り着きます。<br/><br/>とても綺麗な場所でした。<br/><br/>その後、岬や山などを巡り、ホテルで豪華な魚料理を食べました。<br/><br/>とても楽しい一日でした。<br/><br/>酔っ払っているので、少しおかしな文章かもしれません。<br/><br/>ごめんなさい。
