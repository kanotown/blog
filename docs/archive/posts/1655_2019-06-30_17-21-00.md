# 【No. 1655】<strong><em>Shari</strong></em> (シャリ - White/Vinegared Rice)
<div class="date">Jun 30, 2019 17:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Shari</strong></em><br/><br/>White rice or vinegared rice used for sushi is called <strong><em>shari</em></strong> (シャリ) in Japan.<br/><br/>It is thought that <em>shari</em> comes from a Sanskrit term "sarira" (meaning "Buddha's cremains") or "sari" (meaning "rice").<br/><br/>In general, outside of sushi shop, white rice is called <strong><em>kome</em></strong> (米), <strong><em>hakumai</em></strong> (白米), or <strong><em>gohan</em></strong> (ご飯).<br/><br/>Incidentally, rice used for sushi is usually flavored with vinegar and is referred to as <strong><em>sumeshi</em></strong> (酢飯 - literally means "vinegared rice").<br/><br/>There are various reasons for this; vinegared rice has effects of preservation, deodorization, and sterilization, and possess a good flavor.

シャリ<br/><br/>寿司に使う白米や酢飯は、「シャリ」と呼ばれます。<br/><br/>「シャリ」はサンスクリット語で「（釈迦の）遺骨」を意味する "sarira"、もしくは「米」を意味する "sari" から来ていると考えられています。<br/><br/>白米は寿司以外では、「米（こめ）」や「白米」、「ご飯」などと呼ばれます。<br/><br/>ちなみに、寿司に使われる米は通常、酢が加えられた「酢飯」です。<br/><br/>この理由は、味、防腐、防臭、殺菌などさまざまです。

<p class="correction_comment">We often just call シャリ, "sushi rice". You probably already know that but I thought I would write it just in case.</p>

There are various reasons for this; vinegared rice has preserving and sterilising properties, and has a good smell and flavour.
<p class="correction_comment">I'm not sure why, but we often prefer to use verbs to nouns. ~ o ~ BrEn: sterilise; AmEn: sterilize ~ o ~ BrEn: flavour; AmEn: flavor ~ o ~ I'm not sure whether by "deodorising" you meant "has a good smell"</p>

Thank you for the correction! :)<br/>&gt; I'm not sure whether by "deodorising" you meant "has a good smell"<br/>Here, by using deodorising/deodorizing, I wanted to mean that vinegar can remove bad smell.

Oh I see, then it's correct :)
