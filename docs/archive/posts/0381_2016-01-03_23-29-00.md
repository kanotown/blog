帰省<br/><br/>今日は仕事が一段落ついたので実家に帰省しました。<br/><br/>夕方に家につき、甥っ子と姪っ子にお年玉として New Nintendo 3DS をプレゼントしました。<br/><br/>それから家族で夕飯を食べ、母と義兄とスターウォーズエピソード7を観に行きました。<br/><br/>実は私はエピソード4〜6を観ていなかったのですが、楽しかったです。<br/><br/>よくわからないところは、義兄が解説してくれました。<br/><br/>今日は疲れたのでもう寝ます。<br/><br/>おやすみなさい。

 I enjoyed the new Star Wars movie too.  I watched it at the only IMAX theater with a 4K laser projector in New England.  :)

Thank you very much for the corrections and explanations! :)<br/>Wow, the IMAX theater with a 4K laser projector sounds so fantastic. I really want to the theater someday.

<div class="name"><span class="just_name">thethinker83</span><br>
There are only eight of these theaters in the entire world.  Maybe there is one in Japan?  :)
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
Eight?! The number is really small... You're right, according to the Internet, one of them seems to be located in Osaka. I will visit Osaka in next September to participate in an academic conference, so I will reserve a ticket of the theater at that time, hehe.
