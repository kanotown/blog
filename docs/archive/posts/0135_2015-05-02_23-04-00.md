Today, graduates of my laboratory and I went hiking to a nearby mountain that the altitude is about 2000 m.<br/><br/>Since it was very sunny and the air was clear, I felt good, but I got suntanned.<br/><br/>Also, I tried using iPhone's panoramic shooting function first time ever, and took some pictures.<br/><br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/kurumayama1.jpg" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/kurumayama1.jpg</a><br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/kurumayama2.jpg" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/kurumayama2.jpg</a><br/><br/>Actually, we went to near the top of the mountain by car, but I'd like to climb there by bicycle next time.

今日は研究室の卒業生と一緒に、標高2000ｍ程の近くの山までハイキングに行きました。<br/><br/>よく晴れて、空気が澄んでいたので、とても気持ちよかったですが、結構日焼けしてしまいました。<br/><br/>そして、iPhoneのパノラマ撮影機能を初めて試してみました。<br/><br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/kurumayama1.jpg" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/kurumayama1.jpg</a><br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/kurumayama2.jpg" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/kurumayama2.jpg</a><br/><br/>今日は車で山の上の方まで登りましたが、今度は自転車で登ろうと思っています。

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/>Yes, I also think the performance of iPhone 6's camera is good, except the convex design.
