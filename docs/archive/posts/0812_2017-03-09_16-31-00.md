# 【No. 0812】Sanbyoshi Sorou
<div class="date">Mar 9, 2017 16:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese term "sanbyoshi sorou."<br/><br/>The literal meanings is "three beats get together," and it means that three or all necessary conditions are equipped.<br/><br/>In Nou music, a traditional Japanese art, three percussion instruments are used -- kozutsumi (small hand drum), ookawa (knee drum), and taiko (stick drum).<br/><br/>When beats by these instruments get together, a good harmonious performance is given, so this term was born.<br/><br/>For example, if you use this term for a baseball player, it will mean that the player has three excellent abilities -- running, batting, and defence.<br/><br/>This word is often used as good meanings, but you can use it to mean bad elements, such as drinking, gambling, and trafficking women.

三拍子揃う<br/><br/>今日は「三拍子揃う」という表現を紹介します。<br/><br/>「三拍子揃う」は、三つ、もしくは必要な条件すべてが揃っていることを表します。<br/><br/>日本の伝統芸能である能楽では、小鼓、大鼓、太鼓の3つの打楽器が使われます。<br/><br/>これらの楽器の拍子が揃っていると、調和がとれた良い演奏が奏でられることから、このような言葉が生まれました。<br/><br/>例えば野球選手に対して「三拍子揃っている」と言うと、走塁、攻撃、守備の三つの分野が優れていることになります。<br/><br/>この言葉は良い意味で使われることが多いですが、飲酒、賭博、女郎買いなど三つの悪い要素を表すこともあります。

 Interesting! I think that Confucius often wrote in his works that harmony is a virtue.

<p class="correction_comment">"Equipped" doesn't really work in that context.  "Equipped" is more for physical objects.<br/>Ex1: My TV came equipped with LED lights and a cool wall mount.<br/>Ex2: I came equipped with my sword.<br/>The physical object thing doesn't always work, but it generally works.<br/>I'm having a hard time coming up with ways in which it doesn't work.  Sorry about that.  Feel free to ask questions if you're confused.<br/><br/>There's also the different forms of "equip," but I'm going to direct you to a dictionary for that: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/equip<br/>This dictionary is very helpful, and though it might be a little difficult for you because your native language isn't English, it has plenty of examples of how the words are used.<br/><br/>Another thing that's kind of related: Merriam-Webster has a word of the day so you could possibly learn some new English vocab from it.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">(in blue)<br/>In English (at least for European/Western), art has the connotation of visual art, like paintings, drawings, or photography.  It doesn't really work with music, and though people say that music is an art, I was momentarily confused when I saw "art" being used to describe "music" in that way.  <br/>It would be better to say, "In Nou music, a traditional Japanese music, three..."  It pains me to write this though because the repetition of "music" sounds bad, but I don't know any other way to say it.</p>

Thank you very much always for the corrections and helpful comments! :)<br/><br/>Actually, my dictionary says that 伝統芸能 is translated into "traditional art" or "traditional performing art." Will it be better by using the latter?
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">JayfeatherRex</span><br>
No problem!<br/><br/>Yes, it would be better to say performing art--&gt;"In Nou music, a traditional performing art, three..."
