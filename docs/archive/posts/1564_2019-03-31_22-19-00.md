失笑<br/><br/>何かがおかしくて、こらえきれず笑ってしまったことはありますか？<br/><br/>そのような笑いを、日本語で「失笑」と言います。<br/><br/>「失」は通常 "lose" を意味しますが、ここでは "mistake/wrong" を意味します。<br/><br/>また、「笑」は "laugh" を意味するので、「失笑」での文字どおりの意味は "a wrong laugh" となります。<br/><br/>「失」の意味が "lose" である認識が強いためか、「失笑」の意味を「呆れて笑えない」と勘違いしている日本人がとても多いです。<br/><br/>文化庁のアンケート調査によると、60％以上の日本人がこの言葉を間違えて使っているそうです。

<p class="correction_comment">I wasn't sure what you meant by "...is familiar in the meaning of..." The way I corrected it above means that when 失 appears in words, it usually means "lose," so people tend to read it as "lose" even when it means something else.</p>
