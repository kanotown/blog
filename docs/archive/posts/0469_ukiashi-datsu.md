# 【No. 0469】Ukiashi-datsu
<div class="date">Mar 31, 2016 12:24</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about a Japanese term "ukiashi-datsu."<br/><br/>"Uki" of "ukiashi" means to float, and "ashi" of "ukiashi" means your feet.<br/><br/>Therefore, "ukiashi" means a state that you're standing on your tiptoes and your heels are floating.<br/><br/>Since this state is unstable, "ukiashi" came to express that you're restless and anxious, or you have cold feet.<br/><br/>Nowadays, we often use "ukiashi" as "ukiashi datsu (to stand with a state of ukiashi)," or "ukiashi-ninaru (to become ukiashi)."<br/><br/>Recently, people sometimes use "ukiashi-datsu" as the meaning of "to be restless and excited," but this is misuse.

浮き足立つ<br/><br/>今日は日本語の「浮き足立つ」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「浮き足」とは、かかとが浮いて、つま先立ちであることを意味します。<br/><br/>この状態は不安定であるため、「浮き足」は、不安で落ち着きがないことや、逃げ腰になることを意味するようになりました。<br/><br/>そして現在は、基本的に「浮き足立つ」や「浮き足になる」のように使われます。<br/><br/>最近、「楽しみで落ち着きが無い」という意味で「浮き足立つ」と使われることがありますが、これは誤用です。
