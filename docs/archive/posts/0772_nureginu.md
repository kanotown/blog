# 【No. 0772】<strong><em>Nureginu</em></strong> (Innocent Sins)
<div class="date">Jan 28, 2017 21:44</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese term "nureginu."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "wet clothes," and it means "innocent sins" or "unfounded rumors."<br/><br/>When you want to mean "to accuse someone of falsely," you can say "nureginu wo kiseru" by using the verb "kiru," which means "to wear."<br/><br/>Originally, "nureginu" meant "clothes wetted by water."<br/><br/>There are some theories about the etymology, and one of them comes from the following old story:<br/><br/>A stepmother envied the beauty of husband's daughter by a previous marriage, and she put a wet cloth of a fisherman who lived nearby in the daughter's room.<br/><br/>The daughter's father looked the cloth, and he was misled into thinking that she stole the fisherman's cloth, then he killed his daughter.

濡れ衣<br/><br/>今日は「濡れ衣」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「濡れ衣」は、「無実の罪」や「根拠のない噂」などを意味します。<br/><br/>「誰かに無実の罪をかぶせる」ことを言うときは、「濡れ衣を着せる」のように「着る」という動詞が用いられます。<br/><br/>もともと「濡れ衣」は、文字通り「水に濡れた衣服」を表す言葉でした。<br/><br/>語源の説は幾つかありますが、そのうちの一つは以下の昔話からきているというものです。<br/><br/>継母が先妻の娘の美しさを妬み、近くに住む漁夫の濡れた衣を娘の寝室に置きました。<br/><br/>これを見て、娘が漁夫の衣を盗んだと勘違いした実父は、娘を殺してしまいました。
