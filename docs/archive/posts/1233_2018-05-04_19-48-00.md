みどりの日<br/><br/>今日は、みどりの日です。<br/><br/>みどりの日とは、日本の国民の祝日の一つで、「自然にしたしむとともにその恩恵に感謝し、豊な心をはぐくむ」ことを趣旨としています。<br/><br/>「みどり」は "green," 「日」は "day" を意味します。<br/><br/>かつて5月4日は、憲法記念日とこどもの日に挟まれた、特定の名前の無い休日でした。<br/>（日本では、前日および後日祝日の場合、その日は「国民の休日」になります。）<br/><br/>1989年から2006年まで、みどりの日は4月29日でしたが、2007年から5月4日に移動したのです。<br/><br/>もともと昭和天皇の誕生日であった4月29日は、現在は「昭和の日」となっています。

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/><br/>みどり is "green," but according to the Wikipedia, Midori no Hi is translated as "Greenery Day."

Thanks for the info.......Wikipedia is no doubt an excellent resource.....but in common parlance, when I lived in Japan, it was absolutely and always.."Green Day"....I never met anyone who said Greenery Day...
