Saturday<br/>April 28 (Sun) ... Sunday<br/>April 29 (Mon) ... Shōwa Day<br/>April 30 (Tue) ... National Holiday<br/>May 1 (Wed) ... Enthronement of the Crown Prince<br/>May 2 (Thu) ... National Holiday<br/>May 3 (Fri) ... Constitution Day<br/>May 4 (Sat) ... Greenery Day<br/>May 5 (Sun) ... Children's Day<br/>May 6 (Mon) ... Substitute Holiday<br/><br/>Since the Crown Prince was enthroned on May 1, this day became a national holiday only in 2019.<br/><br/>In addition, a weekday between national holidays also becomes a national holiday according to Japanese law, so both April 30 and May 2 became holidays.<br/><br/>Furthermore, when a national holiday coincides with Sunday, next Monday becomes a substitute holiday, so May 6 became a holiday.<br/><br/>Due to the overlapping of several factors, it has become such a long holiday.

10連休<br/><br/>日本にはゴールデンウィークと呼ばれる連休があり、2019年は10連休となりました。<br/><br/>その内訳は下記のとおりです。<br/><br/>4月27日（土）・・・休日<br/>4月28日（日）・・・休日<br/>4月29日（月）・・・昭和の日<br/>4月30日（火）・・・国民の休日<br/>5月1日（水）・・・皇太子殿下即位・改元<br/>5月2日（木）・・・国民の休日<br/>5月3日（金）・・・憲法記念日<br/>5月4日（土）・・・みどりの日<br/>5月5日（日）・・・こどもの日<br/>5月6日（月）・・・振替休日<br/><br/>5月1日に皇太子殿下が即位されたため、2019年に限りこの日が祝日となりました。<br/><br/>そして日本では祝日に挟まれた平日は「国民の休日」となるため、4月30日と5月2日が休みとなります。<br/><br/>さらに、祝日と日曜日などが重なった場合は、休日が減らないよう次の平日を「振替休日」とする制度があるため、5月6日も休みとなります。<br/><br/>幾つかの要素が重なり合って、このような長い連休になったというわけです。

<p class="correction_comment">"Became" is not wrong here, but could be a bit vague. If this is a holiday in 2019 and no other year, I would use "is a". If this is a holiday in 2019 and will continue to be a holiday in 2020 and onward, I would use "starting in".</p>

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/>&gt; "Became" is not wrong here, but could be a bit vague.<br/>May 1st except 2019 is not a national holiday, so the former correction seems to be appropriate. :)
