凍ったトイレ<br/><br/>昨日、家に帰ってトイレに行こうとしたら、水が凍っていました。<br/><br/>このままでは水が流れません。<br/><br/>しかしよく見ると、凍っているのは表面付近だけのようでした。<br/><br/>何度か沸騰したお湯を上からかけ、暫く待っていたら溶けて流れてくれました。<br/><br/>なんとかなりました。<br/><br/>普通の水道であれば、チョロチョロと水を流すことで凍結を防ぐことができますが、トイレはできません。<br/><br/>何か対策を考える必要があります。

 Ah, that's interesting! Perhaps this is because my country doesn't snow, topics like this actually allows me to learn about incidents that do not occur in my country and it enthralls me. It must be troublesome solving that, but still, I would really have liked to see how it looked! (笑) Good luck finding a solution for it :)

Thank you very much always for correcting my post! :)<br/>Haha, indeed it might be a rare occurrence, but it's also astonishingly inconvenient.<br/><br/>Actually, I forgot that I had turned off the cleaning function with warm water and the heated seat function to save electricity. So I turned on them, but if they doesn't work, I will buy antifreeze liquid.

It's my pleasure ^^<br/><br/>I do understand it is astonishingly inconvenient to melt that freeze. Hope it works after you've turned them on! Then you could save some money ;)

Thanks for caring :)<br/>It seems to work, but I'm scared of the electricity charge, haha.

No problem :) hahaha this seems like a tough time for you. Over here in Singapore, it's the other way round. We are afraid of the electricity bills when it comes to summer, because we would somehow switch on the air conditioner every single night due to the sweltering heat here. xD

Actually, I have been to Singapore in December, and I was surprised at the heat and the humidity. Since I have a low tolerance for heat, I might switch on the air conditioner through a whole year if I live in Singapore, haha.
