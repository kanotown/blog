<div class="date">Apr 9, 2021 19:27</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Mī-Hā</strong></em><br/><br/>I think I am <strong><em>mī-hā</em></strong> (ミーハー).<br/><br/><em>Mī-hā</em> refers to a person who is crazy about following trends, even though he/she was not actually interested in them.<br/><br/>It is thought that <em>mī-hā</em> is short for <strong><em>mī-chan hā-chan</em></strong> (みいちゃんはあちゃん)<br/><br/>There are several theories about the etymology of <em>mī-chan hā-chan</em>. I will introduce the most accepted theory in the following.<br/><br/>In Japan at the beginning of 1900, when this phrase was borne, there were many women whose names started with <strong><em>mi</em></strong> (み) and <strong><em>ha</em></strong> (は), such as <strong><em>miyo</em></strong> (みよ) and <strong><em>hana</em></strong> (はな).<br/><br/>Because of this, <em>mī-chan hā-chan</em> became a slang term that represents young women, and later, it came to have the above meaning.

ミーハー<br/><br/>私は「ミーハー」です。<br/><br/>「ミーハー」とは、もともと興味がなかったにもかかわらず、世間で流行したことがきっかけでにわかに熱中する者のことを指します。<br/><br/>「ミーハー」の由来は、「みいちゃんはあちゃん」の略語であると考えられています。<br/><br/>「みいちゃんはあちゃん」の由来は諸説ありますが、以下では有力だと考えられている説を1つ紹介します。<br/><br/>この言葉が生まれた1900年初頭の日本では、「みよ」「はな」など、「み」「は」ではじまる名前の女性が多くいました。<br/><br/>そこから、若い女性を差す俗称として「みいちゃんはあちゃん」が生まれ、後に流行り物に飛びつくという意味を持つようになったそうです。
