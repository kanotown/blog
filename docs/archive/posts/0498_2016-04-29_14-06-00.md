<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I received a sad news.<br/><br/>My grandfather (my mother's father) passed away.<br/><br/>Since my grandfather on my mother's side lived in a remote location, I couldn't meet him frequently.<br/><br/>I think that I should have met to him at short intervals.<br/><br/>He was a Christian, and he seem to be in heaven.<br/><br/>I heard that death is the beginning of eternal life, and is not a sad thing for Christians.<br/><br/>However, I think that most people will feel sad more than a little if their familiar person pass away.<br/><br/>I want to pray for his soul to rest in peace

祖父の死<br/><br/>昨日、訃報がありました。<br/><br/>私の祖父（私の母の父）がお亡くなりになりました。<br/><br/>母方の祖父は、離れた場所に住んでいて、頻繁に会うことはできませんでした。<br/><br/>もっと会っておけばよかったと、思います。<br/><br/>クリスチャンの彼は今、天国にいるそうです。<br/><br/>クリスチャンにとって、死は永遠の命の始まりであり、悲しいことではないと聞きました。<br/><br/>しかし、親しい人の死は、どうしても悲しい気持ちになってしまうと思います。<br/><br/>安らかな眠りをお祈りしています。
