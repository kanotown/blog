# 【No. 0733】<strong><em>Omou Tsubo</strong></em> (Thought Pot)
<div class="date">Dec 20, 2016 11:38</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "omou tsubo".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "thought pot", and it means that something goes what you wanted or what you expected.<br/><br/>Usage example: The war situation became enemy's omou tsubo (thought pot).<br/><br/>Here, "tsubo" means a pot, especially which is used to roll a dice in gambling.<br/><br/>It is said that an experienced dealer who had a role of rolling a dice could decide the number of the dice as he thought.<br/><br/>From this fact, to become what you wanted/expected has come to be referred to as "omou tsubo" (thought pot).

思う壺<br/><br/>今日は「思う壺」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「思う壺」とは、思った通りになることや、期待通りになることを意味します。<br/><br/>使用例：戦況は敵の思う壺になってしまった。<br/><br/>ここで「壺」は、賭博においてサイコロを入れて振るための壺（壺皿）を指します。<br/><br/>熟練の壺振り師は、狙ったとおりのサイコロの目が出せたと言われいます。<br/><br/>このことから、思い通りになることを「思う壺」と呼ぶようになりました。
