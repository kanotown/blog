<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kagishippo</strong></em><br/><br/>There are many stray cats living around my apartment.<br/><br/>Around noon today, a stray cat that crossed in front of me had <strong><em>kagisippo</em></strong> (かぎしっぽ).<br/><br/><strong><em>Kagi</em></strong> (かぎ) means "key," <strong><em>shippo</em></strong> (しっぽ) means "tail," and <strong><em>kagishippo</em></strong> (かぎしっぽ) is a term for representing a tail of a cat bent like a key.<br/><br/>A cat's tail is commonly composed of 18 to 20 coccygeal vertebrae, and it becomes <em>kagishippo</em> when a part of the coccygeal vertebrae deforms or fuses.<br/><br/>Cats with <em>kagishippo</em> have been believed to protect property in Japan and China, and they have been cherished as auspicious cats.<br/><br/>Also in European countries, it seems that such cats are treated as auspicious cats.

かぎしっぽ<br/><br/>私のアパートの周りには野良猫がたくさん住んでいます。<br/><br/>今日の昼頃、私の目の前を横切った野良猫は、「かぎしっぽ」をしていました。<br/><br/>「かぎ」は "key"、「しっぽ」は "tail" を意味し、「かぎしっぽ」は鍵のように曲がった猫のしっぽを表す言葉となっています。<br/><br/>猫のしっぽは一般的に、18～20個の尾椎で構成されており、尾椎の一部がくっついたり変形したりすると、かぎしっぽになるようです。<br/><br/>かぎしっぽの猫は、日本や中国では「財産を守ってくれる」と言われ、縁起のよい猫として大事にされてきました。<br/><br/>また、ヨーロッパでは「幸せをひっかけてくる」と言われ、やはり縁起のよい猫とされているようです。

 My cat was a stray I picked up off the street and he had a kinked tail.  I think he was part Siamese.  That might explain why he had a kink in his tail!  I suppose Thai people think kinked-tail cats bring good luck!

Sounds nice! <br/>&gt; bring good luck!<br/>This is exactly what I wanted to say in my last sentence. I heard that people in European countries also think that such kinked-tail cats bring good luck (cats with kinked tails could hook you good luck).

The average American doesn't know the word "auspicious", so they'd probably say "bring good luck" instead.

Cats with 'kagishippo' have been believed to protect property in Japan and China, and they have been cherished as auspicious cats.
<p class="correction_comment">Correct - but putting 'protect property in Japan and China' at the end of the phrase made me think that the the property had to be in Japan or China (even if the cat was somewhere else). Better would be to put that at the beginning - 'In Japan and China, cats with .....protect property...</p>
