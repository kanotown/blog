# 【No. 1216】<strong><em>Oriitte</strong></em> (折り入って - Earnestly)
<div class="date">Apr 17, 2018 10:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "oriitte" (折り入って) that I will use it later.<br/><br/>"Oriitte" is used as an adverb, and it represents that you ask a favor or have a consultation with someone in a serious manner.<br/><br/>This term was derived from the verb "oriiru" (折り入る), which means to do something with one's whole heart.<br/>(Note that "oriiru" is no longer used now.)<br/><br/>For example, you can use it as the followings:<br/>"Oriitte onegai ga arimasu" (折り入ってお願いがあります - I have a special favor to ask of you).<br/>"Oriitte gosoudan ga arimasu" (折り入ってご相談があります - I'd like to have a private word with you).<br/><br/>We don't say this word frequently, but I think that it is one of beautiful tongues in Japanese.

折り入って<br/><br/>今日は、私がこの後に使おうとしている表現「折り入って」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「折り入って」は副詞的に使われ、真剣な態度で特別な頼み事や相談をするさまを表します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、「心を込めて行う」ことを意味する動詞「折り入る」に由来します。<br/><br/>例えば、「折り入ってお願いがあります」や「折り入ってご相談があります」のように使います。<br/><br/>あまり頻繁に使う言葉ではありませんが、美しい日本語の言葉遣いの一つだと思います。

<p class="correction_comment">'phrase' or 'word' would work best. I know oriitte is just one word, but I feel it is okay to say 'phrase' here (but maybe that's just me...)</p>
