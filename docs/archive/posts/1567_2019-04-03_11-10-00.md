# 【No. 1567】<strong><em>Tachi Ōjō</strong></em> (立ち往生 - Gridlock)
<div class="date">Apr 3, 2019 11:10</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Tachi Ōjō</strong></em><br/><br/>A traffic accident causing injury or death happened yesterday near the center of Tokyo, and many trains stopped, so many people did <strong><em>tachi ōjō</em></strong> (立ち往生) at platforms.<br/><br/>The original meaning of <em>tachi ōjō</em> is "to die while standing," but now it usually means a state in which someone is incapable of moving.<br/><br/><strong><em>Tachi</em></strong> (立ち) means "to stand," and <strong><em>ōjō</em></strong> (往生) is a Buddhist term that means "to die" or "to die and born in the legitimate land of Buddha."<br/><br/>That is to say, the literal meaning of <em>tachi ōjō</em> is equivalent to its original meaning.

立ち往生<br/><br/>昨日は都心で人身事故があり、電車が止まり、多くの人が駅で「立ち往生」していました。<br/><br/>「立ち往生」の本来の意味は「立ったまま死ぬこと」ですが、それが転じて「身動きがとれなくなること」を表すようになりました。<br/><br/>「立ち」は "to stand"、「往生」は仏教用語で「死んで仏の国に生まれること」や「死ぬこと」を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち「立ち往生」の本来の意味は、文字どおりの意味ということです。
