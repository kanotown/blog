# 【No. 1554】<strong><em>Sihou Happou</strong></em> (四方八方 - Every Direction)
<div class="date">Mar 21, 2019 20:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Sihou Happou</strong></em><br/><br/>In my previous post, I introduced the word <strong><em>happou</em></strong> (八方), which means every direction in the surroundings.<br/><br/>Of course, <em>happou</em> itself makes sense, but if you want to emphasize that directions are diverse, you can use the four-character idiom <strong><em>sihou happou</em></strong> (四方八方).<br/><br/><strong><em>Shi</em></strong> (四) means "four," <strong><em>ha/hachi</em></strong> (八) means "eight," <strong><em>hou/pou</em></strong> (方) means "direction," so the literal meaning of this idioms is "four directions and eight directions."<br/><br/>Both <strong><em>sihou</em></strong> (四方) and <strong><em>happou</em></strong> (八方) mean every direction, but in the narrow sense, the former means north, south, east and west, and the latter means northeast, northwest, southeast and northeast in addition to <em>sihou</em>.

四方八方<br/><br/>以前の投稿の中で、周囲のさまざまな方向を表す「八方」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>もちろん「八方」だけでも意味をなしますが、より周囲のさまざまな方向であることを強調したい場合、「四方八方」と言うこともできます。<br/><br/>「四」は "four"、「八」は "eight"、「方」は "direction" を意味するので、「四方八方」の文字どおりの意味は "four directions and eight directions" となります。<br/><br/>「四方」も「八方」もさまざまな方向を表す言葉ですが、狭義において「四方」は「北」「南」「東」「西」、八方はそこに「北東」「北西」「南東」「南西」を加えた方向のことです。

<p class="correction_comment">two different senses of "itself" (where you placed it, it sounds like それ自体)<br/><br/>In English, we say "every which way" if we want to emphasise "in all (various) directions". This "way" can mean either "direction" or "method." It's probably more commonly used for "method", but you could say:<br/><br/>"Every which way he looked, there was nothing but trees and rocks. There was no sign of the path anywhere"</p>

Both 'sihou' (四方) and 'happou' (八方) mean every direction, but in the narrow sense, the former means north, south, east and west, and the latter means northeast, northwest, southeast and northeast in addition <span class="f_blue">to the four cardinal directions</span>.
