<h1 id="subject_show">Futsutsuka</h1>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "futsutsuka."<br/><br/>"Futsutsuka" means that someone is inexperienced or insensitive due to lack of his/her ability or education.<br/><br/>It is said that this term comes from "futotsuka" -- where "futo" means "thick" and "tsuka" means "bulk." <br/><br/>In the past, it literally meant that something is thick and sturdy.<br/><br/>However, during the Heian period, aesthetic sense of delicate was widely spread in Japan.<br/><br/>Therefore, "futsutsuka" came to mean that thick things are unromantic, then it came to have the current meanings.<br/><br/>Also, we often calle such people "futsutsuka mono" ("mono" means "person").

ふつつか<br/><br/>今日は「ふつつか」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ふつつか」は、能力やしつけが足りず、行き届かないさまや、気の利かないさまを表す言葉です。<br/><br/>この言葉は「ふとつか」から転じたとされ、かつては文字通り「太く丈夫なさま」という良い意味を表していました。<br/><br/>しかし、平安時代で優美繊細の美意識が浸透し、太いものは情緒に欠けているという意味を持つようになり、現在のような意味に変化しました。<br/><br/>また、そのような人のことを「ふつつかもの」と言います。
