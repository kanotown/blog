# 【No. 1143】<strong><em>Sarushibai</em></strong> (猿芝居 - Stupid Trick)
<div class="date">Feb 3, 2018 05:26</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Formerly, I introduced you to the Japanese term 猿真似 (sarumane), which means to imitate acts of others without thinking.<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/63865845310158804822564330234895781584" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/63865845310158804822564330234895781584</a><br/><br/>Today I would like to talk about another Japanese term, 猿芝居 (sarushibai), which also contains the word 猿 (saru) as well as "sarumane" does.<br/><br/>Since 猿 (saru) means "monkey" and 芝居 (shibai) means "show" or "play," "sarushibai" originally meant a "monkey show" literally.<br/><br/>Later, it has come to mean a "poor show/performance," a "sucky play," and an "inept trick."<br/><br/>Incidentally, "sarushibai" is a little similar to the Japanese term 茶番 (chaban), which was introduced in the following my entry.<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/203983428487821700505159013443589740611" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/203983428487821700505159013443589740611</a>

猿芝居<br/><br/>以前私は、「考えもなくむやみに人のまねをすること」を意味する「猿真似」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>今日は、同じく「猿」を使った言葉「猿芝居」を紹介します。<br/><br/>猿は "monkey," 芝居は "show" を意味するので、もともと猿芝居は文字通り "monkey show" を意味する言葉でした。<br/><br/>これが後に、下手な演技をあざける言葉として使われるようになり、更に、見え透いた浅はかなたくらみを意味するようにもなりました。<br/><br/>この言葉は、以下のリンクで紹介している「茶番」と意味が少し似ています。

 ahahaha, it's like the English equivalent of "Monkey see, monkey do." I have a request for a future entry: can you explain the origin of 一か八か?

Thank you for letting me know the expression! It's pleasing to the ear.<br/><br/>&gt; I have a request for a future entry: can you explain the origin of 一か八か?<br/>Thank you for the suggestion. Actually, I already talked about 一か八か in the following entry :)<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/113625984541929466656458525521577151436" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/113625984541929466656458525521577151436</a>
