<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Hana wo Oru</strong></em><br/><br/>Continuing from yesterday's post, I would like to talk about an idiom related to nose, <strong><em>hana wo oru</em></strong> (鼻を折る).<br/><br/><strong><em>Hana</em></strong> (鼻) means "nose" and <strong><em>oru</em></strong> (折る) means "to break," so the literal meaning of <em>hana wo oru</em> is "to break one's nose."<br/><br/>Of course, you can use this phrase to mean to break someone's nose physically.<br/><br/>However, it is often used to mean to subdue someone's pride.<br/><br/>People who take pride in something is described as <strong><em>hana ga takai</em></strong> (鼻が高い - literally "one's nose is high").<br/><br/>That is to say, <em>hana wo oru</em> implies that you break someone's high nose.

鼻を折る<br/><br/>昨日に引き続き、今日は「鼻を折る」という慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>「鼻」は "nose"、「折る」は "to break" を意味するので、「鼻を折る」の文字どおりの意味は "to break one's nose" となります。<br/><br/>もちろん、この言葉は文字どおり、物理的に誰かの鼻を折ることを意味することもあります。<br/><br/>しかし、実際には「得意がっているものをへこませて、恥をかかせる」ことを意味することが多いです。<br/><br/>得意がっている人は鼻を高くします。<br/><br/>「鼻を折る」とは、その高くなった鼻をへし折るということです。

<p class="correction_comment">I would put "high nose" in quotation marks since you're quoting the phrase you mentioned earlier and this phrase isn't used in English in the same way</p>
