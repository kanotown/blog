# 【No. 0949】<strong><em>Ashi ga Hayai</strong></em> (足が早い - Spoil Rapidly)
<div class="date">Jul 24, 2017 23:13</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I bought a Costco's new cake, "Strawberry Trifle" yesterday.<br/><br/>Since cakes are "ashi ga hayai" (足が早い), I have to eat all of them by tomorrow.<br/><br/>Here, the literal meaning of "ashi ga hayai" is that something's legs are quick, and it means that food or something is spoil quickly.<br/><br/>"Ashi" (legs/feet) could represent changes in movements or states of things, and perishable things change quickly (hayai - 早い), so they have come to be called "ashi ga hayai."<br/><br/>Also, based on the same etymology, "ashi ga hayai" can mean that a product or something sells fairly well.

足が早い<br/><br/>私は昨日、コストコの新作ケーキ「ストロベリーストライフ」を購入しました。<br/><br/>ケーキは「足が早い」ので、今日か明日までに食べきらないといけません。<br/><br/>ここで「足が早い」は、食品などが腐りやすいことを意味します。<br/><br/>「足」はものごとの移動や様子の変化を表すことがあることから、「腐りやすいもの」は「足が早い」と言われるようになったとされています。<br/><br/>また、同様の語源から、「足が早い」は「商品の売れ行きが良い」ということを表すこともあります。

 "Product or something"
 <br/>
 "Food or something"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This is not natural English although it does not break any grammar rules.  You might consider using "et cetera/etc." here, although overuse becomes awkward very quickly.
