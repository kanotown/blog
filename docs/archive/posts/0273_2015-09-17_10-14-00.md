# 【No. 0273】Don't Mind
<div class="date">Sep 17, 2015 10:14</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Japan, we often say "ドンマイ(don-mai)," when we encourage people who made a mistake.<br/><br/>"ドンマイ" is the word derived from "( I ) don't mind" in English, but I learned that the nuance is different for Japanese and English.<br/><br/>English speakers seem to say "I don't mind" instead of "don't mind," but this doesn't mean to encourage someone.<br/><br/>"ドンマイ" in Japan is similar to "Never mind" and "Don't worry about it" in English.<br/><br/>Since there are several phrases whose nuances have changed by taking root in Japan, we have to be careful when we use them.

Don't mind<br/><br/>日本では、失敗した人を励ますとき、よく「ドンマイ」と言います。<br/><br/>「ドンマイ」は英語の「( I ) don't mind」に由来する言葉ですが、英語と日本語ではニュアンスが違うことを知りました。<br/><br/>英語では「Don't mind」ではなく「I don't mind」と言うそうですが、これは自分が気にしないという意味であり、相手を励ましているわけではありません。<br/><br/>日本での「ドンマイ」は、英語では「Never mind」や「Don't worry about it」のようです。<br/><br/>日本で定着してニュアンスが変わってしまった英語は幾つかあるので、使うときは注意したいです。
