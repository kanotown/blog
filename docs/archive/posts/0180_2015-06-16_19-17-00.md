<h1 id="subject_show">ID Photo</h1>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I had my friend take a photo for my resume.<br/><br/>We firstly used a single lens reflex camera, but it was not so great.<br/><br/>Next, we used iPhone 6's camera, and the result was somehow better.<br/><br/>So I decided to use the photo by iPhone.<br/><br/>However, since it was a little dark, I slightly adjusted the brightness.<br/><br/>I believe such a brightness adjustment is OK. Maybe.

Thank you very much for your corrections and comment!<br/><br/>I have one question.<br/>In the above sentence, I thought 'have' is an causative verb that is used something like "have + someone+ verb." But can(should) I say "have + someone+ to verb?"

Welcome, I believed @Oceansea has also helped you below. <br/><br/>Yes, you can say in either way. In my context, I think to be much formal and proper, with the "to" makes it sound better.

<p class="correction_comment">I think the verb "try" is better than "used" here.<br/><br/>"First we tried a single lens reflex camera..."<br/><br/>We will often say "first I tried this, then I tried that, and so on." It is a good way to show that maybe you did not know which picture would be the best.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">You can use "try" again here too.<br/><br/>"An iPhone 6's camera"<br/>Note that "a" changed to "an" because "iPhone" starts with a vowel sound.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">"OK" is usually spelled "okay" in writing. "OK" is more like an abbreviation.</p>
