# Although I rarely get annoyed, I was different today.
<div class="date">Jan 9, 2015 22:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Although I rarely get annoyed, I was different today.<br/><br/>A student told me something like "You might be criticized by your boss because you're wasting time in such a trashy programming.".<br/><br/>What?!  I never thought it's a waste of time and never ignored my study!!!!!!<br/><br/>If he were a professional programmer, I might barely understand his remark, but he's a complete beginner.<br/><br/>Furthermore, He spends five days a week not studying at all.<br/><br/>I really didn't want to be said such a thing from such him.<br/><br/>Humph, humph!<br/><br/>I'm so sorry to sing the blues.
