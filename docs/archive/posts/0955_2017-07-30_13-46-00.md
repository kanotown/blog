# <strong><em>Debu</strong></em> (でぶ - Fat)
<div class="date">Jul 30, 2017 13:46</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Recently I might have become a little bit "debu" (でぶ),<br/><br/>"Debu" is a slang term that refers to a fat person or animal, and is often used as an ironic expression.<br/><br/>The most accepted theory about its etymology is that the onomatopoeia, "deppuri" (でっぷり), which means fat, chenged to "debu debu" (でぶでぶ), and finally became "debu."<br/><br/>There are other theories, for example, one of them is that "double chin" changed to "debu chin" (でぶちん), then changed to "debu." <br/><br/>Please be careful not to say "debu" to other people inconsiderately.

でぶ<br/><br/>最近私は少し「デブ」に近づいてきたかもしれません。<br/><br/>「デブ」とは、肥満体型の人、すなわち太っている人のことを指す俗語であり、よく差別用語として使用されます。<br/><br/>この言葉の語源は、太っていることを表す擬音語「でっぷり」が変化して「でぶでぶ」となり、「でぶ」となったとする説が有力です。<br/><br/>その他にも、"double chin" (二重あご) が「でぶちん」となり、「でぶ」となった説などがあります。<br/><br/>決して軽い気持ちで他人に「でぶ」と言わないように注意して下さい。
