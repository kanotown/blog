# 【No. 0952】Mid-term Graduation Research Presentation
<div class="date">Jul 27, 2017 22:24</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, a mid-term graduation research presentation (poster presentation) of senior students was held in my university.<br/><br/>I was very busy because I had to prepare and manage the venue, collect and arrange Fast Forward (1 minute presentations for posters), and go out for giving a class several times.<br/><br/>Yesterday, I was working until midnight, and finally stayed at my university.<br/><br/>It was a very difficult day, but the presentation went very well, so I'm satisfied.<br/><br/>However, although there were many interesting posters, I could check only some of them because of my class.<br/><br/>I have a regret only about that.

卒研中間発表<br/><br/>今日は、大学4年生の卒業研究の中間発表会（ポスター発表）が行われました。<br/><br/>私は会場の準備をしたり、ファストフォワードの集約作業をしたり、途中で授業をしに行ったり、かなり忙しかったです。<br/><br/>昨日は大学に泊まり込みで作業していました。<br/><br/>とても大変でしたが、頑張ったかいあってか、発表会は滞りなく行われました。<br/><br/>その点は満足です。<br/><br/>ただ、面白そうな発表が多かったにも関わらず、授業のためあまり聞けなかったのが心残りです。
