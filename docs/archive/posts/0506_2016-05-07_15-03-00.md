# 【No. 0506】The Meaning of "Jibun"
<div class="date">May 7, 2016 15:03</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the meaning of the Japanese word "jibun."<br/><br/>Normally, "Jibun" means "I," and is used when you refer to yourself.<br/><br/>For example: "Jibun ha Tokyo shusshin desu (I am from Tokyo.)"<br/><br/>However, in Western Japan, "jibun" means "you," and is used when you refer to your conversation partner.<br/><br/>For example: "Jibun doko kara kitann (where are you from)?"<br/><br/>The reason is because they speak while thinking the conversation partner's perspective.<br/><br/>"Boku" is the first-person word for men, but we sometimes use it as the meaning of "you" toward young boys, such as "boku, nan-sai (how old are you)?"<br/><br/>As just described, since first-person and second-person words are sometimes mingle in Japan, please be careful.

「自分」の意味<br/><br/>今日は、日本語の「自分」の意味を紹介します。<br/><br/>「自分」は通常、話し手が自分自身を参照する際に使う一人称の言葉です。<br/><br/>例：自分は東京出身です。<br/><br/>しかし、関西地方で「自分」は、話し相手を指す際に使う二人称の言葉です。<br/><br/>例：自分どこから来たん？<br/><br/>これは、話す際に相手の立場に立って考えているからです。<br/><br/>「僕」は男が使う一人称ですが、女性が小さい子どもに対して相手目線になり、「僕、何歳？」のように使うこともよくあります。<br/><br/>このように日本語には、一人称と二人称が入り交じることがありますので、注意しましょう。
