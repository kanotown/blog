<h1 id="subject_show">Predicate adjectives that begin with "a"</h1>
<div class="date">Apr 7, 2015 23:53</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned an adjective that begin with "a" is a predicative adjective almost all cases.<br/><br/>In the other words, this adjective don't modify nouns, but is used for a complement.<br/><br/>For example, afraid, alike, alone, asleep, alive awake, etc.<br/><br/>(Of course, there are exceptions such as unable, well, glad, worth, pleased, liable.)<br/><br/>I became curious, so I searched for them.<br/><br/>In Old English, these adjectives had a meaning of progressive, or was a past participle, so they often represent a state.<br/><br/>Also, a progressive form in Old English was represented like "bēon + on + V-ing."<br/><br/>Through Medium English from Old English, prefixes "an-" and "a-" came to be used instead of "on."<br/><br/>It is said that "alive" or "asleep" is exist as a vestige of that.<br/><br/>This is the reason why an adjective that begin with "a" is a predicative adjective.<br/><br/>Also, a present participle was represented like "bēon + V-ende" in Old English, and this became "be + V-ing," and finally, a progressive form "be + V-ing" was born by combining a gerund and a present participle.<br/><br/>Ah, I think my sentences are so hard to understand. I'm sorry.

私は、a で始まる形容詞はほとんど全て叙述用法でのみ使われると学びました。<br/><br/>言い換えれば、名詞を修飾せず、補語としてのみ使用される形容詞です。<br/><br/>例えば afraid, alike, alone, asleep, alive, awake などです。<br/><br/>（unable, well, glad, worth, pleased, liable などの例外もあります。）<br/><br/>少し気になったので、少し詳しく調べてみました。<br/><br/>これらの形容詞は古英語において、進行形の意味を持っていたり、過去分詞であったりしたため、状態を表すことが多いようです。<br/><br/>また、古英語の進行形は、bēon + on + V-ing のように、動名詞の前に on をつけて表していました。<br/><br/>古英語から中英語にかけて on の代わりに接頭辞 an- そして a- が使われるようになり、その名残として alive や asleep があると言われています。<br/><br/>これが、a で始まる形容詞が叙述用法で使われる理由です。<br/><br/>また、古英語で現在分詞は bēon + V-ende というように表されており、これが be + V-ing となり、動名詞と現在分詞が組み合わさって現在の進行形が生まれました。<br/><br/>あぁ、理論がめちゃくちゃでわかりにくいかもしれません。ごめんなさい。

 This was a tough post to correct! Your English was very good -don't worry! :) It's just that the grammatical terms and the topic in general isn't something native speakers come across on a daily basis! I learnt a lot today~ Thank you :)

Thank you very much for your helpful corrections and comment!<br/>I'm happy about your words. :)<br/><br/>&gt; I thought that you were talking about the 'progressive form' so I changed it to that<br/>Your guess is perfect! I appreciate so much your deductive powers!

<p class="correction_comment">"Progressive" also can mean "to make progress." When speaking about grammar terms, I think it is a good idea to say "the progressive tense." Although it is not required to say "tense," it does help keep things clear.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">I think that "constructed" is a good word to use here. We often talk about sentence constructions in English, so it makes sense to use it. Your example of "bēon + on + V-ing" is an example of a sentence construction.<br/><br/>I think it is good to add the word "this." "Bēon + on + V-ing" is only one example. There are many other examples that could be used. In fact, it might even be a good idea to describe the construction first, and then give your example. For example:<br/><br/>"In English a progressive form is constructed by adding the suffix "-ing" to the end of a verb. For example: run + ing."<br/><br/>Two sentences written like this are very clear.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">"Middle" seems to be used to describe times or distances.<br/>"Medium" seems to be used to describe cooking (the egg was medium done) or thickness (the thank had medium armor).<br/><br/>I say "seems to be used" because I just thought about it by myself for a little bit before posting.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">Some people might not realize that "V" stands for verb. If you want, you could say something like<br/><br/>"Also, a present participle was represented like "bēon + V-ende" (where "V" represents a verb) in Old English..."</p>

 I think that this is a very difficult subject for you to write about! I am impressed. Writing about the grammar of a language that you are learning is not easy. It is even more difficult to write about the history of that grammar. You are very brave!

Thank you very much for correcting my post!!<br/>Your corrections and comments are really helpful, and I'm happy about your words. :)<br/><br/>I heard something like "if you learn history of English, it will be fun to learn English," so I will sometimes try to learn history of English!
