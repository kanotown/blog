# <strong><em>Uri Futatsu</strong></em> (Two Melons)
<div class="date">Oct 8, 2016 10:17</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "uri futatsu."<br/><br/>The literal translation is "two melons," and it means that brothers or parent and child are very similar to each other.<br/><br/>This word comes from the fact that when you cut a melon in two, these  cross sectional shapes are very similar.<br/><br/>However, the same is true for many other vegetables and fruits.<br/><br/>Although it's not fully reliable, it could come from the fact that a cross section of a melon was compared to a face of a beautiful woman in Japan.<br/><br/>By the way, there is a similar expression in English: "as like as two eggs."

瓜二つ<br/><br/>今日は「瓜二つ」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「瓜二つ」とは、兄弟や親子などがよく似ていることを表す言葉です。<br/><br/>瓜を二つに切ったとき、二つの切り口がとてもよく似ていることに由来します。<br/><br/>しかし、このことはほとんどの野菜や果物に対しても言えます。<br/><br/>瓜が選ばれた理由は定かではありませんが、瓜の断面が美人の顔の形に例えられていること（瓜実顔）と関係しているかもしれません。<br/><br/>ちなみに英語では、「よく似た二つの卵」(as like as two eggs) のように、卵を用いた表現があります。

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>I learned something new :)<br/><br/>&gt; That would be two halves of a melon, wouldn't it?<br/>Yes, I wanted to say that two halves of a melon have the almost same cross sectional surfaces.
