<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Tokoya</strong></em> (Barber Shop)</h1>
<div class="date">Dec 17, 2016 14:00</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the etymology of the Japanese word "tokoya", which means "barber shop".<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "toko" is "floor", and "ya" is "shop".<br/><br/>In the Edo period in Japan, people who make men's hairstyle or cut men's hair were called "kami-yui" ("kami" means "hair" and "yui" means "to fix").<br/><br/>Also, since hairstyles were made / hairs were cut on a simple floor, such a store was called "kami-yui doko" ("doko" means "floor").<br/><br/>Then "kami-yui" in "kami-yui doko" was omitted, and "ya" which means "shop" or "occupation" was attached, it became "tokoya".<br/><br/>By the way, most customers of tokoya are men, and women usually go "biyoin" (hair salon).

床屋<br/><br/>今日は「理髪店」を意味する「床屋」という日本語の語源を紹介します。<br/><br/>（「床」は "floor", 「屋」は "shop" を意味します。）<br/><br/>江戸時代の日本では、男性の髪を結ったり剃ったりする職業を文字通り「髪結い」と呼んでいました。<br/><br/>また、髪結いは簡易的な「床」を用意して行われたことから、そのような店は「髪結い床」と呼ばれました。<br/><br/>現在では「髪結い床」の「髪結い」が省略され、店や職業を表す「屋」が付き、「床屋」となりました。<br/><br/>ちなみに「床屋」の客の多くは男性で、「女性」は「美容院」に行くことが多いです。
