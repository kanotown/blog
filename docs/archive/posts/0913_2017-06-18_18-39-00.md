# 【No. 0913】<strong><em>Orekireki</strong></em> (お歴々)
<div class="date">Jun 18, 2017 18:39</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Even though I am Japanese, I sometimes come across Japanese words I don't know when referring a dictionary.<br/><br/>Today, I found the Japanese term "orekireki" (お歴々), which refers to people who have a high identity and a high status.<br/><br/>Here "reki" (歴) means that something follows histories or places in succession, or something is clearly different.<br/><br/>Also, the latter "reki" has a function that emphasizes the term just before it, and "rekireki" has come to mean that someone is different (someone has a high identity), in addition to its original meaning.<br/><br/>Later, the polite prefix "o" has often come to added to rekireki, and now orekireki mainly has the above meaning.

お歴々<br/><br/>私は日本人ですが、辞書を調べているとまだまだ知らない日本語も存在します。<br/><br/>今日は、身分や地位が高く立派な人々を指す「お歴々」という言葉を見つけました。<br/><br/>ここで「歴」は、何かが次々と時間や場所をたどっているさまや、何かがはっきりと違うさまを意味します。<br/><br/>「々」は「歴」を強めるはたらきを持ち、「歴々」は何かがはっきりと違うさまの意味に加えて、誰かがほかと違う人であること、すなわち身分の高い人も指すようになりました。<br/><br/>後に丁寧の接頭辞「お」が付き、お歴々はもっぱらそのようなことを意味するようになりました。
