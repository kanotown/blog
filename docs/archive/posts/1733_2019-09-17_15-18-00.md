<div class="date">Sep 17, 2019 15:18</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Ichihayaku</strong></em><br/><br/>When describing you do something quickly before anyone else, you can use the Japanese expression <strong><em>ichihayaku</em></strong> (いち早く).<br/><br/>People often think that <strong><em>Ichi</em></strong> (いち) can be written in kanji as 一, which means "one," but actually it is written as 逸, which means "remarkable" or "extraordinary."<br/><br/>In addition, <strong><em>hayaku</em></strong> (早く) means "fast" or "quick."<br/><br/>That is to say, <em>ichihayaku</em> means "extraordinarily fast/quick" or "ASAP."<br/><br/>For example, you can say <strong><em>kare wa ichihayaku kitaku shita</em></strong> (彼はいち早く帰宅した - "He went home before anyone else").

いち早く<br/><br/>他の人よりも早く、真っ先に何かをするとき、「いち早く」という表現を使うことがあります。<br/><br/>「いち」は "one" を意味する「一」であると思われがちですが、実際には "remarkable" や "extraordinary" を意味する「逸」です。<br/><br/>また、「早く」は "fast" や "quick" を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち「いち早く」は、"extraordinarily fast/quick" や "ASAP" のような意味になります。<br/><br/>例えば、「彼はいち早く帰宅した」のように使います。
