残念なプレミアムフライデー<br/><br/>二日前、日本でプレミアムフライデーが導入されたことについて書きました。<br/><br/>月末の金曜日は早めに仕事を切り上げ、消費喚起を促すキャンペーンです。<br/><br/>しかし、実際に早帰りなどの対応をした企業は120社程度だったそうで、日本全体のたった0.1％です。<br/><br/>ある企業は「金曜に早く帰るために他の日の残業が増えたら意味がない」とも述べています。<br/><br/>一部のネットユーザーは、この日は本当にプレミアムな国民、すなわち上級国民のために作られた日だと不満の声をあげています。

 The post has already been corrected but I wanted to say that I don't think Premium Friday was a great idea to begin with.  In my opinion people would just go home earlier.  Maybe it should be a long lunch break on Fridays eg 2 hours, so there is nothing else to do but go shopping.
</p>

A long lunch break might be a good idea. It might be good even every Friday or every day. Some Japanese employees continue working without enough break, so they should take an adequate rest on a regular basis for improving work efficiency.

<p class="correction_comment">You don't need to say that it's on Premium Friday because it was mentioned recently.<br/><br/>(in blue)<br/>It sounds more natural to say "isn't" instead of "is not" in casual writing.</p>

&gt; I would rephrase this. Using "however" sounds a little odd.<br/>Is it natural to use "unfortunately" instead of "however?"
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">JayfeatherRex</span><br>
No problem!<br/><br/>Yes, it sounds better to use "unfortunately".  This actually changed my understanding of what you said.
