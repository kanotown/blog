<h1 id="subject_show">A Fact about Suicide in Japan</h1>
<div class="date">Feb 19, 2015 21:19</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Today, I'd like to write a hidden fact about suicide in Japan. In Japan, it is reported that the number of suicide is around 30,000 people per year for the last 10 years. This is not a small number, however, can it be true? In fact, WHO says that the number of suicide in Japan is around 110,000 people per year. In Japan, the number of unnatural death is 150,000 people per year. WHO counted the half number of unnatural death as the number of suicide. However, Japanese government doesn't say that. Also, they doesn't recognize a suicide without a testament as a suicide, and the suicide without the testament is counted as an unnatural death. Therefore, it is said that the accurate number of suicide in Japan is around 180,000 people per year. On the other hand, the number of deaths in Japan is around 1.2 million people per year. This means that one people out of seven people in Japan will die in suicide. I think this is a horrible fact.
