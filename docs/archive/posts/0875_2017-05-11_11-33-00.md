# 【No. 0875】<strong><em>Utsukushii</strong></em> (Beautiful)
<div class="date">May 11, 2017 11:33</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the common Japanese adjective "utsukushii."<br/><br/>"Utsukushii" refers to that colors, shapes or sounds of something are beautiful.<br/><br/>This term comes from the verb "itsukushimu," which expresses a feeling of compassion for weaker persons than yourself.<br/><br/>Therefore "utsukushii" originally referred to the same meaning of "itsukushimu." <br/><br/>However, around the beginning of the Heian period, it came to express feelings of cute/sweet for tiny/young ones, and after the end of the Heian period, it has come to have the current meaning.<br/><br/>Also, the kanji for "utsukushii" is "美しい," and "美" can be decomposed into "羊," meaning sheep, and "大," meaning big.<br/><br/>This might be related that sheep were very rare in the past in China, and they were used as a reward or a gift to God.

美しい<br/><br/>今日は一般的な日本語である「美しい」についてお話します。<br/><br/>「美しい」は、色・形・音などの調和がとれていて綺麗であることを表す形容詞です。<br/><br/>この言葉は「いつくしむ」が変化したもので、もともとは自分より弱いものに対する慈しみの感情を表しました。<br/><br/>そして、平安初期以降には小さい/幼いもの対する「かわいい」「いとしい」といった感情を表すようになり、平安末期頃から今の意味になったとされています。<br/><br/>また、「美しい」の「美」という漢字は、「羊」と「大」に分解することができます。<br/><br/>これは、かつて中国では羊は珍しく、何かの褒美や神様への供え物としても利用されていたことと関係しているかもしれません。

Thank you so much for correcting my post, Yukinekorin-san!<br/>I think that most Japanese people don't know such a history/origin about Japanese words. Now you know more about some Japanese terms than Japanese people! :)
