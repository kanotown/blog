もしもし<br/><br/>今日は「もしもし」というとても頻繁に利用される表現を紹介します。<br/><br/>「もしもし」は、相手に呼び掛ける際に用いる言葉で、特に電話の第一声で使用されます。<br/><br/>この言葉は、「これから話をします」という意味の「申す（もうす）」という動詞に由来します。<br/><br/>かつてはこの動詞を連ねて「申す、申す」もしくは「申します、申します」と使われていましたが、これが短縮されて「もしもし」となりました。<br/><br/>ちなみに、日本で電話が開通した当初は「おいおい」という言葉が使われていました。<br/><br/>しかし、「おいおい」は男性が使う少し乱暴な表現ということで、しばらくして使われなくなりました。

<p class="correction_comment">(in blue)<br/>This is an appositive phrase.  You are saying what the expression is so you need to use commas.<br/><br/>"was used"<br/>I can't explain "was" versus "were" very well so I've included a site for you to reference: http://writingexplained.org/was-vs-were-difference</p>
