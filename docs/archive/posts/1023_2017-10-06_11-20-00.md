ぐでんぐでん<br/><br/>昨日は飲み会がありました。<br/><br/>私は仕事のため途中で退散しましたが、中には「ぐでんぐでん」になった人もいたかもしれません。<br/><br/>「ぐでんぐでん」は、正体をなくすほど酒に酔っ払った様子を表す言葉です。<br/><br/>「ぐでん」は、男性の尊称「貴殿」から来ています。<br/><br/>「貴殿」の「貴」は "you" を意味しますが、これが「愚か者」を意味する「愚（ぐ）」に置き換えられ、「愚殿（ぐでん）」という言葉ができました。<br/><br/>以前、「へべれけ」という日本語を紹介しましたが、「ぐでんぐでん」はそれよりもさらにひどい状態を表します。

 I see, hebereke and guden both express drunkenness. I guess it's like the difference between sloshed and crunk.
