<h1 id="subject_show">Review My Posts</h1>
<div class="date">Feb 7, 2015 23:51</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Today, I tried to reviewing my posts because I sometimes make a same mistake. However, lang-8 is opens slowly, so I can't review comfortably. Therefore, I created the following web page.<br/><br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/lang-8/" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/lang-8/</a><br/><br/>In this page, my previous posts are published. By using this page, I can easily review my mistakes. Furthermore, I'd like to investigate a trend of my mistakes someday. I think I have made a lot of boo-boo relevant to articles.
