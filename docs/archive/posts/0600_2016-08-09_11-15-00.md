600回目の投稿<br/><br/>今日で600回目の投稿になります。<br/><br/>かなり危ない日もありましたが、なんとか休まず続けることができています。<br/><br/>そして明日から、私の大学はお盆休みに入ります。<br/><br/>お盆とは、祖先の霊を祀る日本の行事であり、我々はよくこの期間にお祭りを開いたり、お墓参りをします。<br/><br/>お盆中に行われる夏祭りでよく行われる「盆踊り」という言葉を聞いたたことがあるかもしれません。<br/><br/>盆踊りはもともと死者を供養する意味合いを持っていましたが、最近では宗教的意味合いは薄れ、娯楽のように親しまれています。

<p class="correction_comment">"there were some dangerous days" sounds very unnatural in this context.<br/>"Although I was in danger of missing my target, I managed to continue to write one English post everyday, without missing a day."<br/><br/>"In danger" also sounds very extreme. Like something bad would have happened to you if you didn't do it.<br/>You could tone it down by saying, "Although I came close to missing my target, I managed to continue to write one English post everyday, without missing a day."<br/><br/>Personally, I would say,<br/>"Although I sometimes came close to missing my target of writing one English post a day, I managed to continue it everyday for 600 days."</p>
