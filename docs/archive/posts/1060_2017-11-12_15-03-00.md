# 【No. 1060】<strong><em>Ude ga Naru</strong></em> (腕が鳴る - Itching to Do)
<div class="date">Nov 12, 2017 15:03</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Have you ever been excited due to a feeling that you want to show someone your skills or power?<br/><br/>If you want to represent such a feeling, you can say the Japanese idiom "ude ga naru" (腕が鳴る).<br/><br/>The "ude" (腕) means "arm," the "naru" means "making a sound," so the literal meaning of "ude ga naru" is "one's arms make a sound."<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I couldn't find the etymology about this idiom.<br/><br/>However, since "ude" can also mean "skill" or "power," probably Japanese people thought that "ude" lets us know to want to be exerted by making a sound.

腕が鳴る<br/><br/>技能や力を発揮したくて、うずうずしたことはありますか？<br/><br/>そのような気持ちを表す慣用句に、「腕が鳴る」というものがあります。<br/><br/>「腕」は "arm," 「鳴る」は "making a sound" を意味するので、「腕が鳴る」の文字どおりの意味は "one's arms make a sound" となります。<br/><br/>残念ながら、この慣用句の語源に関する説明を見つけることはできませんでした。<br/><br/>しかし、「腕」は技能や腕力も意味するので、それらが音を鳴らして使われたがっていると考えたのが成り立ちだと思います。
