四苦八苦<br/><br/>ものすごく苦労することや、非常に苦しいことを、日本語で「四苦八苦」と言います。<br/><br/>「四」は "four," 「苦」は "suffering," 「八」は "eight" を意味するので、この言葉の文字どおりの意味は "four sufferings, eight sufferings" となります。<br/><br/>もともとこの言葉は、仏教においてあらゆる苦しみを意味するものでした。<br/><br/>「四苦」は「生」、「老」、「病」、「死」の4つの苦しみを表します。<br/><br/>「八苦」では上記の4つの苦しみに加えて、「愛別離苦（愛する者と別離する苦しみ）」、「怨憎会苦（恨み憎んでいる者に会う苦しみ）」、「求不得苦（求めるものが得られない苦しみ）」、「五蘊盛苦（人間の肉体と精神が思うがままにならない苦しみ）」を表します。<br/><br/>例えば「四苦八苦する」のように使われます。
