# 【No. 1170】<strong><em>Tokoton</em></strong> (とことん - Thoroughly)
<div class="date">Mar 2, 2018 11:22</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
When you want to express the end of things or doing something thoroughly, you can use the Japanese term とことん (tokoton).<br/><br/>This term comes from the rhythmic stepping sound トコトントコトン (tokoton tokoton), which represents a Japanese dance.<br/><br/>There are two theories about the etymology of this sound -- one says that "toko" means "floor" and "ton" is an onomatopoeia that represents the stepping sound, and the other says that "tokoton" itself is the onomatopoeia.<br/><br/>Also, the reason why "tokoton" has come to have the current meaning is because the Japanese military song とことんやれ節 (tokoton yare bushi) had become popular in 1868.<br/><br/>Where やれ (yare) means "do it," and 節 (bushi) means "melody."<br/><br/>It's thought that since the discipline of the military was very strict, "tokoton yare" (tokoton do it) was considered as "do it thoroughly until the end."

とことん<br/><br/>物事の最後の最後や、徹底的に何かをすることを表す時、「とことん」という日本語を使うことがあります。<br/><br/>この言葉は、日本舞踊を表現する「トコトントコトン」というリズミカルな足拍子の音に由来します。<br/><br/>この足拍子には、「トコ」は「床」を意味し「トン」のみが擬音だとする説と、「トコトン」自体が擬音だとする説がありますが、正確なことはわかっていません。<br/><br/>そして、「トコトン」が現在の意味を持つようになった理由は、1868年に流行した軍歌「とことんやれ節」に由来します。<br/><br/>「やれ」は "do it," 「節」は "melody" を意味します。<br/><br/>軍の規律の厳しさから、「とことんやれ」が「最後まで徹底的にやれ」のような意味に捉えらたものと考えられます。

<p class="correction_comment">I got caught on it too, but in English sentence structure it is safer to not use things like: "--" ":" etc. Also, if you can spit one big sentence into 2 separate ones ALWAYS do it. ;) it will be a winning decision.

<p class="correction_comment">* try avoiding abbreviations as much as possible in academic writing, such as "It's" "We'll" "I'm" etc. Use instead the complete forms as "It is" "We will" "I am" etc.<br/>* And, remember to pay attention to the right punctuation. I know it is very tricky. but you are doing good so far! just be more careful.<br/>* Try using more verbs to explain things whenever you can.</p>

 Your English writing skills are amazing! Such a great sense of sentence composition, as well as grammar and words usage! You also have a very well put vocabulary, which is a great asset to have. Keep up with your consistent efforts!

Besides, I found it interesting reading your post. Japanese Onomatopoeias are my weak point! <br/>Thank you for writing about it!

Thank you so much for the corrections and helpful comments!<br/>I'm glad to hear you say that :)<br/><br/>&gt; I believe because of the wooden shoes they wear when dancing traditional Japanese dances. Is it?<br/>日本舞踊 (nihon buyō) is indeed a kind of traditional Japanese dances, but as far as I know, actors wear 足袋 (tabi - split-toe socks), not wooden shoes. Of course, socks don't make clear stepping sounds. Note that Japanese people tend to express various things by using onomatopoeia, even if it doesn't make a sound.<br/><br/>&gt; I got caught on it too, but in English sentence structure it is safer to not use things like: "--" ":" etc. Also, if you can spit one big sentence into 2 separate ones ALWAYS do it. ;) <br/>Thank you for the explanation, I understand well. :)<br/>Please let me ask one question. If these listed elements were words (not sentences), would it be recommended to use "--" or ":" etc.? (E.g., "There are three types: A, B, and C.")
