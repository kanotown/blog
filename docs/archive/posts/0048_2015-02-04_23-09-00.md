# Interesting English Sites
<div class="date">Feb 4, 2015 23:09</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I found some interesting English sites, for example, The Oatmeal, FML, Engrish.com, and so on.<br/><br/>The Oatmeal is a comic website created by Matthew Inman. All comics on this site were drawn by him, and a huge variety of comics are published. These comics look like really interesting, but unfortunately, I couldn't understand almost all these comic jokes without dictionaries. I think If I can read these comics smoothly, they will become more interesting.<br/><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/" target="_blank">http://theoatmeal.com/</a><br/><br/>On the other hand, I could understand some jokes of FML without dictionaries. Every day, many people post interesting events that happened to them as their diary on FML. Almost all posts are really short and simple. <br/><a href="http://www.fmylife.com/" target="_blank">http://www.fmylife.com/</a><br/><br/>I think I can take a breathing spell and learn English by reading these sites' jokes. I will sometimes try to read these jokes for my relief and studying.

I will sometimes try to read these jokes for my relief and studying.
<p class="correction_comment">"Relief" likes to have the word "from" after it. For example, "I need a relief from studying."<br/><br/>But I think that you mean "I will sometimes try to read these jokes to take a break or to study."</p>

Thank you so much for your correction!<br/><br/>&gt; They spell "English" with an "r?" That is interesting.<br/>Yes, this site introduce weird English which is used in some countries such as Japan!<br/><a href="http://www.engrish.com/" target="_blank">http://www.engrish.com/</a><br/><br/>&gt; But I think that you mean "I will sometimes try to read these jokes to take a break or to study."<br/>Yes! I think your guess is perfect! Thank you again. (^-^)

Thank you very much for correcting me! :D<br/><br/>&gt; i am not sure what a "breathing spell" is~ did you mean "take a breather" ? i got confused ^^'<br/>Yes! I wanted to say something like "take a breather." Actually, according to my dictionary, meaning of "take a breathing spell" and "take a breather" was the same! :O<br/><br/>&gt; Do you know any Japanese websites that are the same? if you do could you please tell me! ^u^<br/>Hmm, I'm sorry. I don't know any Japanese site like FML. <br/>It's a little different, but I sometimes watch animal topic of NAVER to help me relax. :)<br/><a href="http://matome.naver.jp/topic/1Hiol" target="_blank">http://matome.naver.jp/topic/1Hiol</a><br/><br/>Also, this is a joke site which many people post their jokes for pictures.<br/><a href="http://bokete.jp/" target="_blank">http://bokete.jp/</a>
