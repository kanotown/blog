<h1 id="subject_show">Body Fat Percentage of Pigs</h1>
<div class="date">Jan 16, 2016 12:50</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Obese people are sometimes referred as "豚(buta, which means pig)" in Japan.<br/><br/>(I have no idea whether such a figurative expression is used as well overseas.)<br/><br/>However, the body fat percentage of the pig is actually about 13% to 18%.<br/><br/>That is, it is lower than the body fat percentage of the average human.<br/><br/>Also, some people seem to use "豚(pig)" as the meaning of "dirty" or "idiot."<br/><br/>However, pigs are a cleanly animal, because they distinguish clearly a toilet, a bedding, and a place to eat.<br/><br/>Furthermore, since they can recognize themselves when they watch a mirror, it's able to be said that they have high cognitive abilities.<br/><br/>The expression "pig" might be a compliment.

豚の体脂肪率<br/><br/>日本では、太っている人のことを「豚」ということがあります。<br/><br/>（海外でもそのような表現をするのかはわかりません。）<br/><br/>しかし、実は豚の体脂肪率は13％～18％程度だそうです。<br/><br/>すなわち、平均的な人間の体脂肪率よりも低いのです。<br/><br/>また、「汚い」や「馬鹿」であるという意味でも「豚」という言葉が使われることがあるようです。<br/><br/>しかし豚はきれい好きで、豚は糞をする場所や寝床、食べる場所などを自分で区別します。<br/><br/>さらに、鏡を見て自分であることを認識できるため、とても高い認知能力を持っていると言えます。<br/><br/>「豚」という表現は褒め言葉になるかもしれません。

 Pigs are very interesting animals.  Recently they have become a very popular pet in America because they are smart, clean, and cute

Thank you very much for correcting my post!<br/>Sounds interesting. In the near future, mini/micro pigs might become a popular pet in Japan as well.

 Interesting! I've heard that pig's intestines are similar to those of human beings, and can be easily transplanted without risk of side effects.

You're welcome!^_^<br/><br/>&gt;And thank you foe letting me know the interesting information.<br/><br/>It's nothing.^_^<br/><br/>&gt;By the way, my boss has used and analyzed pig's femur instead of human's one on his &gt;research.<br/><br/>I see. It seems that humans and pigs are genetically close to each other.
