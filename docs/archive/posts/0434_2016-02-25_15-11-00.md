# 【No. 0434】The Meaning of "Unique"
<div class="date">Feb 25, 2016 15:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The word "unique" is one of foreign words that are often used in Japan.<br/><br/>It is said that "unique" was derived from "unus," which means "one" in Latin, and it has several meanings such as "individual" or "sole."<br/><br/>However, somehow many Japanese misunderstand the meaning of "unique."<br/><br/>If we say "he is a unique person (彼はユニークな人だ)," the meaning will become something like "he is a funny person (彼は面白い人だ)."<br/><br/>In my opinion, Japanese confuse the meanings of "unique（ユニーク）" with "humor（ユーモア）."

ユニークの意味<br/><br/>「ユニーク」は日本でよく使われる外来語の一つです。<br/><br/>「ユニーク」はラテン語で「1」を表す「unus」が語源だと言われており、「唯一の」や「独特な」といった意味があります。<br/><br/>しかし、何故か日本人の多くは「ユニーク」の意味を勘違いしています。<br/><br/>「彼はユニークな人だ」と言うと、「彼は面白い人だ」という意味になります。<br/><br/>個人的には、日本人は「ユニーク」と「ユーモア」と混同しているのではないかと思っています。

 In your last sentence it would perhaps be better to start it with "In my experience…" as it is surely more than conjecture on your behalf. Your English is though very good. A synonym for unique is idiosyncratic which does extend to meaning outre or not the norm and in a possibly humorous way, so not all that wide of the mark.

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>I'm glad to hear you say that :)<br/>Also, I didn't know the meaning of "unique" could be extended like that. I will be more careful when I write my post! Thank you for letting me know.

Thank you for writing it, I did not know of the words latin root. Your English usage is both natural and crystal clear in meaning.

 "Gorgeous" is another one that's changed meaning in Japanese. In English, we'd say "gaudy" instead.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But, I think it's natural for a loanword to adopt new meanings in its new language. English has done that to a few Japanese words too, like "head honcho" (any kind of "boss"/VIP in English), and "tsunami" (large oceanic waves caused by earthquakes - as distinct from "tidal waves" - caused by the moon's gravity).

Thank you very much for the corrections!<br/>I also thought "Gorgeous" means something like "gaudy." Thank you for letting me know.<br/>Indeed, to change the meaning might be natural as you said :)
