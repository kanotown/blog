# 【No. 0221】The Meaning of "失笑"
<div class="date">Jul 27, 2015 13:17</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to introduce the word "失笑," which is misunderstood by many Japanese people.<br/><br/>Although the true meaning of "失笑" is to burst out laughing, around 70% Japanese think it as to laugh scornfully.<br/><br/>I think the reason why is that the main meaning of "失" is "lost."<br/><br/>If we read the sentence "笑いを失う," we would think it as something like "it wasn't funny thing."<br/><br/>However, the meaning of "失" in "失笑" is "mistake." <br/><br/>Therefore "失笑" means mistaking laughing, and it was extended to mean bursting out laughing.<br/><br/>After you read this post, you would be more savvy about "失笑" than many Japanese people, but please be careful when you use it.<br/><br/>Because many of us regard "失笑" as a bad meaning.

Thank you very much for correcting me! :)<br/>&gt; Does "bursting out laughter(←mistaken laughter?)" mean "laughing out loud?"<br/>I think it's a little different meaning. I wanted to use "mistaken laughter" as the meaning of situation like the following:<br/>(During an important meeting) Tom should not laugh in the meeting, but he find something funny, and eventually he fail to stifle a laugh. "Pff!"

 誤用といえば、他にも有名な例がありますね。「浮足立つ」、「煮詰まるところ」とか。

お詳しいですね！<br/>そのどちらも、正しい意味で使っている人をほとんど見たことがありません。（笑）<br/>また、私の大学では「敷居が高い」を間違った意味で使う人が本当に多いです。
