5C問題<br/><br/>私は先日、「5C問題」と遭遇しました。<br/><br/>5C問題とは、プログラミングなどで日本語を扱う際に起こりうる問題です。<br/><br/>日本語は通常、それぞれの文字が2バイトで表現されます。<br/><br/>しかし、日本語用文字コードの一つである Shift-JIS を使うと、特定の文字（例えば「表」や「十」、「ソ」）の2バイト目の文字コードが '5C' となります。<br/><br/>'5C' 単体ではバックスラッシュ記号となり、これは多くのプログラミング言語のエスケープ文字として採用されています。<br/><br/>このため、日本語の特定の文字がプログラミング上で特殊な意味を持ち、エラーなどを誘発するというわけです。

 This was interesting to learn. Do you also know of the set of kanji included in ASCII that are not real kanji? It's very fascinating stuff.

Thank you for the correction!<br/><br/>&gt;  Do you also know of the set of kanji included in ASCII that are not real kanji?<br/>I do not know that. Is it a set of kanji for jokes or something?

I spent a long time searching, but I couldn't find the page where I learned this. The story is that when computer designers first sought out to make a working Japanese alphabet in ASCII, they sent requests all over the country asking for each town name in Kanji. When it came time to transcribe them though, the designers made some mistakes, and they accidentally invented several kanji that have no meaning, but are still in the ASCII alphabet today. It's fascinating.<br/>This isn't the link I was talking about, but here is a site that collects more "fake kanji":<br/><a href="http://zht.glyphwiki.org/wiki/Group" target="_blank">http://zht.glyphwiki.org/wiki/Group</a>:%E5%89%B5%E4%BD%9C%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%86%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88

It looks like the link didn't work, but if you can search "創作漢字", it should take you to them then.

Wow, thank you so much for letting me know that! The story and fake kanji (創作漢字) are very interesting and fascinating. I will check them more. :)
