# 【No. 1752】<strong><em>Zen wa Isoge</strong></em> (善は急げ - Now is the Time for Action)
<div class="date">Oct 5, 2019 20:04</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Zen wa Isoge</strong></em><br/><br/>I sometimes remind myself of the Japanese proverb <strong><em>zen wa isoge</em></strong> (善は急げ).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>zen</em></strong> (善) means "good/virtue" and <strong><em>isoge</em></strong> (急げ) means "hasten/hurry," the literal meaning of <em>zen wa isoge</em> is "hasten to do good things."<br/><br/>In other words, this proverb says that if you think it is a good thing, you should do it immediately without hesitation.<br/><br/>However, unplanned and imprudent actions can cause a bad result, so you should also have some caution.<br/><br/>It can be translated into English as "Now is the time for action."

善は急げ<br/><br/>私はときどき「善は急げ」ということわざを自分に言い聞かせます。<br/><br/>「善」は "good/virtue"、「急げ」は "hasten/hurry" を意味するので、「善は急げ」の文字どおりの意味は "hasten to do good things." になります。<br/><br/>すなわち、「良いと思ったことならば、ためらわずすぐに実行するべきだ」ということを言っているわけです。<br/><br/>ただ、無計画に慌てて行動しては失敗してしまうかもしれないので、気をつけなければいけません。<br/><br/>英語では "Now is the time for action" のように言うことができます。

<p class="correction_comment">We don't really use "result" after the verb "cause," nor do we often use it in the singular. I see Japanese people do this often. What Japanese word are you thinking of? Maybe "outcome" is a better translation of it, even though "results" is a more common word in English?</p>

Thank you for the correction! :)<br/><br/>I thought that the Japanese sentence 'warui kekka wo maneku' (悪い結果を引き起こす).<br/>Here, 'warui' (悪い) means "bad," 'kekka' (結果) means "result/outcome/consequence," and 'hikiokosu' (引き起こす) means "cause/deliver/produce/lead to."<br/><br/>I just chose the most common translation for each word from that, but such thoughtless behavior seems to lead to bad outcomes.

I like how you used the word outcome instead of results in your reply. It made me smile :P You're learning quickly.
