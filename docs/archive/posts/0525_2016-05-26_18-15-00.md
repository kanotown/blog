<h1 id="subject_show">Do Tea (Ocha-suru)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>May 26, 2016 18:15</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "ocha-suru."<br/><br/>("Ocha" is a noun that means tea, and "suru" is a verb that means do.)<br/><br/>Ocha-suru means to drink something or get rest at a coffee/tea shop.<br/><br/>In 1970s, phrases like "～suru (do something)" were prevalent in Japan.<br/><br/>In addition to "ocha-suru," "eiga-suru (which means to watch a movie)" and "tabaco-suru (which means to smoke)" seemed to be used. <br/><br/>However, the phrase "ocha-shinai? (shall we do tea?)" continues to be used as a pickup line, and only "ocha-suru" still remains.

お茶する<br/><br/>今日は、日本語の「お茶する」という表現を紹介します。<br/><br/>お茶するとは、喫茶店に行って何かを飲んだり、休憩したりすることを意味します。<br/><br/>1970年代の日本では、「～する」というフレーズが流行しました。<br/><br/>「お茶する」の他にも「映画する（映画を見に行く）」「タバコする（タバコを吸う）」などが使われていたそうです。<br/><br/>しかし、ナンパの常套句として「お茶しない？」という表現が使われ続け、「お茶する」だけが現在でも残っています。

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; It is hard to understand what you mean by this... is the prhase not used at all anymore?<br/>Sorry for my confusing English. Yes, you're true. We don't use those phrases anymore.

In addition to "ocha-suru", "eiga-suru" (to watch a movie) and "tabaco-suru" (to smoke) were used.
<p class="correction_comment">I put the meanings after the ending quotation marks, since I'm sure people in Japan don't say "eiga-suru, which means to watch a movie" every time they go to say "eiga-suru" :D<br/><br/>Essentially: the information in parentheses, unless truly part of the quote, should not go in quotation marks. You'll likely still be understood even when you do it, but it's better to put clarifying information after the ending quote.</p>

 My favourite of these する-verbs is probably キスする, hehe. :D

Thank you very much for correcting my post!<br/><br/>I also like the phrase, haha.<br/>The flow up to kiss (to an opposite sex person) in Japan might be able to be expressed using only する-verbs, something like:<br/>告白する -&gt; デートする -&gt; キスする (and プロポーズする -&gt; 結婚する)
