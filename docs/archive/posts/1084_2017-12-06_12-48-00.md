# 【No. 1084】<strong><em>Unubore</strong></em> (うぬぼれ - Egotism)
<div class="date">Dec 6, 2017 12:48</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I used the Japanese term "unubore" (うぬぼれ), in order to admonish a student.<br/><br/>"Unubore" means that you convince yourself that you are a better person than you actually are -- in other words, it means that you get overconfident.<br/><br/>The "unu" means "oneself" and the "bore/hore" means "to fall for someone," so the literal meaning of "unubore" is "to fall for oneself." <br/><br/>You know, when you fall for yourself, you would believe that you are a great person/ you have a great ability.<br/><br/>Also, a person who has such a character is called "unubore-ya" (うぬぼれ屋).

うぬぼれ<br/><br/>私は昨日、学生を戒めるために「うぬぼれ」という言葉を使いました。<br/><br/>「うぬぼれ」とは、実際以上に自分が優れていると思い込むことを意味します。<br/><br/>「うぬ」は「自分」を意味するため、「うぬぼれ」の文字どおりの意味は「自分自身に惚れ込むこと」です。<br/><br/>自分自身に惚れるということは、自分が優れている/高い能力を持っていると過信しているということです。<br/><br/>また、そのような考えを持つ人を、「うぬぼれ屋」と言います。
