# 【No. 0923】<strong><em>Chichin Puipui</strong></em> (ちちんぷいぷい)
<div class="date">Jun 28, 2017 08:17</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I think that almost all Japanese people have heard the spell, "chichin puipui."<br/><br/>This spell is mainly used to relieve pain when a child is injured.<br/><br/>In the actual situation, it's often used like "chichin puipui, itaino itaino tondeike" (here "itaino" means "pain" and "tondeike" means "blow away something").<br/><br/>In the past, it was chanted as "chichin puipui goyo no ontakara" (ちちんぷいぷい 御代の御宝), and it's thought that this came from "chijin buyu goyo no ontakara" (智仁武勇御代の御宝)<br/><br/>Chijin means "knowledge," buyu means "force," goyo no ontakara means "our treasure," and it is said that a foster mother of Iemitsu TOKUGAWA, the third Shogun, used this phrase when she made her son stop crying, with the feeling that please don't cry because you are our treasure with both knowledge and power.

ちちんぷいぷい<br/><br/>日本人なら「ちちんぷいぷい」という呪文を聞いたことがあると思います。<br/><br/>この呪文は主に、子どもが怪我をした際に痛みを和らげるために用いられます。<br/><br/>実際には「ちちんぷいぷい、痛いの痛いの飛んでいけ」のように使います。<br/><br/>古くは「ちちんぷいぷい御代の御宝」と唱えられ、これは「智仁武勇御代の御宝」から変化したものと考えられています。<br/><br/>三代将軍徳川家光の乳母が子をあやす際に、「智仁武勇に長けたあなたは御代の御宝なのだから、どうか泣かないで」という気持ちを込めて言った言葉だとされています。
