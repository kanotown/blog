耳を傾ける<br/><br/>今日は「耳を傾ける」という慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>文字通りの意味は "to lean an ear" であり、「聴き逃しのないよう、注意して/熱心に聞く」ことを表します。<br/><br/>この慣用句は、何かを注意深く聞こうとするとき、片耳が傾くことに由来します。<br/><br/>「聞く」という漢字の代わりに「聴く」と利用することで、「耳を傾ける / 注意深く聞く」というニュアンスを持たせることもできます。<br/><br/>ちなみに、英語では "to lend an ear" （耳を貸す）と言います。<br/><br/>文字通りの訳の「耳を貸す」という慣用句もありますが、少しだけニュアンスが異なります。<br/><br/>「耳を傾ける」は講演などの話者に敬意を表して集中して聞くという意味で使われることが多い一方、「耳を貸す」は一対一の会話で相手の話を聞くことや、相談に乗るという意味で使われることが多いです。
