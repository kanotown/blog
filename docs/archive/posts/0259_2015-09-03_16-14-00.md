昨日、Netflix が日本でのサービスを開始しました。<br/><br/>1か月無料だったので、とりあえず登録しました。<br/><br/>ラインナップはそんなに多くありませんが、好みのドラマもありました。<br/><br/>画質がとてもきれいで、英語字幕がつくものが多く、役立ちそうです。<br/><br/>Amazom も今月、プライム会員に向けて同様のサービスを実施します。<br/><br/>どちらにしようか迷います。

 Netflix started in Australia a few months ago too! I love it, haha! Although, it can be a little distracting when I have assignments to do 😅
