# 【No. 1960】<strong><em>Tamatama</strong></em> (たまたま - "By Chance")
<div class="date">Sep 7, 2021 19:40</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Tamatama</strong></em><br/><br/>The Japanese adverb <strong><em>tamatama</em></strong> (たまたま) means that something happens by chance.<br/><br/><em>Tamatama</em> is often used in our daily lives, however, it is necessary to be careful about its accent.<br/><br/>If you want to mean "by chance," pronounce only the first character <strong><em>ta</em></strong> (た) a little lower, and pronounce the rest part <strong><em>matama</em></strong> (またま) at a constant height.<br/><br/>In contrast, if you pronounce only the first character <em>ta</em> a little higher, and pronounce the rest part <em>matama</em> at a constant height, it becomes a slang term that means "testes."<br/><br/>This is because <strong><em>tama</em></strong> (たま) also means "ball."

たまたま<br/><br/>日本語の「たまたま」は、「偶然」を表す副詞です。<br/><br/>日常的によく使用される言葉ですが、アクセントには気をつける必要があります。<br/><br/>「偶然」を表したい場合は、最初の「た」だけ少し低く発音し、後の「またま」は一定の高さで発音します。<br/><br/>逆に、最初の「た」だけ少し高く発音し、後の「またま」は一定の高さで発音すると、「精巣・睾丸」を表す俗語となります。<br/><br/>これは、「たま」が "ball" を意味することもできるためです。

 That's so funny and interesting, I never realized that it was the accent that changes the meaning! I'll definitely mind my pronunciation whenever I want to say "by chance" in Japanese!

Thank you for the correction!<br/>Perhaps it will be understood in context, regardless of accent, but please be careful when you use it!

 is that why eggs are tamago because they are shaped like a ball ?
</p>

Thank you for the correction!<br/>&gt; is that why eggs are tamago because they are shaped like a ball ?<br/><br/>Perfectly true!<br/>Since eggs are ball-shaped, they are called 'tamago' (たまご/卵/玉子). Here, 'tama' means "ball" and 'go/ko' means "child," so the literal meaning of 'tamago' is a "child ball."
