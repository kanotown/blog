「海豚」の意味<br/><br/>"Sea" を意味する「海」と "pig" を意味する「豚」を組み合わせた「海豚」という言葉があります。<br/><br/>「海豚」の漢字どおりの意味は "sea pig" ですが、実際には何と読み、何を意味するかわかりますか？<br/><br/>答えは、"dolphin" を意味する「イルカ」です。<br/><br/>「海豚」は中国語で、そのままの形と意味で日本に伝わりました。<br/><br/>16世紀の中国の百科事典によると、「海に住む、豚に似た生き物」という事実に由来するとのことです。<br/><br/>個人的には、イルカと豚はあまり似ていないと思います。

 I would have expected it to mean "manatee" (マナティー) rather than "dolphin." (Another name for "manatee" is "sea cow".) We have manatees here in Florida, although they were categorized as an endangered species until a few years ago, and are still categorized as "vulnerable."

Thank you for the correction!<br/>Indeed, it might be reasonable to assume that "manatee" (or "dugong") would be more appropriate than "dolphin."<br/><br/>&gt; We have manatees here in Florida, <br/>Sounds nice, I'd like to see them sometime :)
