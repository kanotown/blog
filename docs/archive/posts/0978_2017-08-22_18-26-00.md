<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Atezuppou</strong></em> (当てずっぽう - Random Guess)</h1>
<div class="date">Aug 22, 2017 18:26</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
If you do or say something irresponsible with no basis, you will be told "atezuppou" (当てずっぽう) in Japanese.<br/><br/>"Atezuppou" means something like random guess, and it's used like "Atezuppou na koto wo iuna" (当てずっぽうなことを言うな - Don't say atezuppo things.)<br/><br/>The most acceptable theory about its etymology is that it comes from the term "ate zuiryou" (当て推量), which has come to be used since the Edo period.<br/><br/>Here "ate" (当て) means "prospect," and "zuiryou/suiryou" (推量) means "guess."<br/><br/>The theory says that "ate zuiryou" became "atezui" for short, and it became "atezuibou" by personifying ("bou" is a suffix word that is sometimes added to boys' names), and finally it became "atezuppou."

当てずっぽう<br/><br/>何の根拠もなしに、いいかげんな事を行うことを、日本語で「当てずっぽう」と言います。<br/><br/>この語源として最も有力なものは、江戸時代に使われていた「当て推量」から来ているというものです。<br/><br/>「当て」は「見込み」を意味し、「推量」は文字どおり推し量るという意味です。<br/><br/>「当て推量」が「当推（あてずい）」となり、これが擬人化され「当てずい坊」となり、最終的に「当てずっぽう」になったというわけです。

"Atezuppou" refers to the act of making groundless claims. We often use the phrase "atezuppou na koto wo iuna" -- or "don't make groundless claims."

<span class="f_blue">Linguists theorize</span> that the term "ate zuiryou" became abbreviated into "atezui," which in turn became personified/nominalized in the word "atezuibou" through the addition of the suffix "bou" that is commonly added to boys' names.

<p class="correction_comment">Your sentence is fine as written.<br/><br/>The part "... and it's used like ..." is technically okay but feels a little awkward. Maybe something like<br/><br/>       Atezuppou" means something (like)/(similar to) random guess. An example (sentence)/(of its use) would be: "Atezuppou....</p>

<p class="correction_comment">Your sentence is fine as written. I'll comment on bluepanda's comments.<br/><br/>most acceptable vs most <br/>accepted - Either word could be used but which one you would use depends on what you intend the sentence to mean.<br/><br/>most accepted -&gt; Out of all the possible theories concerning its etymology I'm going to present the most commonly held theory....<br/><br/>most acceptable -&gt; The theories concerning "ate zuiryou's"' etymology cover a wide range of credibility.  One even theorizes that the term originated in one of the American author Mark Twain's early works however, I'm gong to present the most authoritatively believable theory.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">Its fine as written. <br/><br/>An alternative:<br/><br/>The theory states that "ate zuiryou" was first shortened to "atezui", then personified to "atezuibou"  ("bou" is a suffix word that is sometimes added to boys' names), and finally it became "atezuppou."</p>
