エイプリルフールの起源<br/><br/>今日はエイプリルフールなので、その起源についてお話します。<br/><br/>ご存知のとおり、4月1日、エイプリルフールは嘘をついてもよいという日です。<br/><br/>エイプリルフールの起源については幾つかの説がありますが、正確なことはわかっていません。<br/><br/>その中で最も有力はのもは、フランスが発祥の地だとする以下の説です。<br/><br/>かつて、ヨーロッパでは3月25日を新年とし、4月1日まで春の祭りを開催していました。<br/><br/>しかし、1564年にフランスのシャルル9世が1月1日を新年とする暦を採用しました。<br/><br/>これに反発した人々が、4月1日を「嘘の新年」とし、嘘のパーティ招待状やイタズラのプレゼントを贈るなど、馬鹿騒ぎを始めたそうです。

 I thought that the year starting on January 1st was a feature of the Julian calendar, so roughly 2000 years old.
