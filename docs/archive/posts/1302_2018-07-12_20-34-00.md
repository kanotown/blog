# 【No. 1302】<strong><em>Gyūjiru</strong></em> (牛耳る - Dominating)
<div class="date">Jul 12, 2018 20:34</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Gyūjiru</strong></em><br/><br/>When someone controls an organization or a community as he/her want, we refer to the action as <strong><em>gyūjiru</em></strong> (牛耳る).<br/><br/><strong><em>Gyū</em></strong> (牛) means <em>cow</em> or <em>bull,</em> <strong><em>ji</em></strong> (耳) means <em>ear,</em> and <strong><em>ru</em></strong> (る) is the suffix which can verbalize a noun.<br/><br/>In the past in China, when lords joined in an alliance, the leader took/cut cow's ear, and the lords licked the blood to swear loyalty.<br/><br/>Because of this, to be a leader of an alliance came to be called "gyūji wo toru" (牛耳を執る - taking a cor's ear), and it later also came to mean to control/dominate an organization or a community. <br/><br/>These days, it is usually used as <em>gyūjiru</em> for short.

牛耳る<br/><br/>組織や団体を思い通りに動かすことを、「牛耳る」と言います。<br/><br/>「牛」は 'cow' や 'bull,' 「耳」は 'ear,' そして「る」は名詞を動詞化するはたらきを持つ言葉です。<br/><br/>かつて中国では、諸侯が同盟を結ぶ際、盟主が牛の耳を執り、その血をすすり合って忠誠を誓ったそうです。<br/><br/>このことから同盟における盟主となることを「牛耳を執る」をいうようになり、さらには「組織や団体を思い通りに動かす」ことを意味するようになりました。<br/><br/>現在では、省略して「牛耳る」と使われることが多いです。

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/>Since it is a story of 770 BC, the fact may be uncertain.

Always my pleasure. I see. I'm just glad people do not have to lick the blood off a cut ear of a poor innocent cow in this present era, haha. xD

 「RepublicansはHouseとSenateを牛耳っている」を言えますか？
</p>

</div><div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
政治の話題では「牛耳る」という表現がよく使われます。<br/><br/>House も Senate も過半数が Republicans なので、牛耳っていると言えますね。
