<h1 id="subject_show">Ichi-moku Oku</h1>
<div class="date">Oct 29, 2015 16:44</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to explain the phrase "ichi-moku oku (place one stone)," derived from the board game called Go.<br/><br/>In Go, a weaker will sometimes start the game with placing one (or several) stone.<br/><br/>From such a thing, we have become to say "ichi-moku oku" when we acknowledge someone's superiority.<br/><br/>For example, the phrase is used like the following:<br/><br/>Since this kid was remarkable, I acknowledge his superiority.<br/>（彼のような子供は珍しいので、一目置いている。）<br/><br/>However, it is rude that you say "ichi-moku oku" to elders and betters, so please be careful when you use it.

一目置く<br/><br/>今日は、囲碁というボードゲームから派生した熟語「一目置く」を紹介します。<br/><br/>囲碁では、弱いほうが先に石を一つ置いてから勝負を始めます。<br/><br/>ここから転じて、相手の実力を認めて敬意を払うときに「一目置く」と言うようになりました。<br/><br/>例えば、以下のように使います。<br/><br/>彼のような子供は珍しいので、一目を置いている。<br/><br/>ただし、目上の人に対して使うと失礼にあたるので、注意して下さい。

 Interesting! Am I wrong thinking that this phrase is similar to 兜を脱ぐ?

Thank you very much always for correcting my post!<br/>&gt; Am I wrong thinking that this phrase is similar to 兜を脱ぐ?<br/>"兜を脱ぐ" means "acknowledge one's defeat" or "surrender," so this is a little different from "一目置く."<br/>I think "兜を脱ぐ" is similar to "投了する," that comes from the world of Go and Shogi.
