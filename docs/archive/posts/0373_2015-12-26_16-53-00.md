# 【No. 0373】Zebra Trivia
<div class="date">Dec 26, 2015 16:53</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Few days ago, I wrote an article about cheetahs and zebras.<br/><br/>Today, I will write interesting (maybe) trivia especially about zebras.<br/><br/>Zebras' bodies are black, and white hairs grow in a stripe pattern.<br/><br/>The stripe pattern makes their bodies look big, and it has an effect to keep their body temperature by creating air flows on their body surfaces.<br/><br/>Also, stripe patterns of zebras are different for each individual, and they identify fellows using the patterns.<br/><br/>By the way, the more hot the region is, the more the stripe line grow.

シマウマの雑学<br/><br/>先日、チーターとシマウマについての記事を書きました。<br/><br/>今日は、シマウマの（きっと）面白い雑学を紹介します。<br/><br/>シマウマの体は黒色で、白い毛が縞模様のように生えています。<br/><br/>この縞は体を大きく見せたり、体表面に空気の流れを作り体温を保つ効果があります。<br/><br/>また、シマウマの縞模様は一頭ごとに異なっており、彼らは仲間を模様で識別しています。<br/><br/>ちなみに、暑い地域ほど縞の本数が多いそうです。
