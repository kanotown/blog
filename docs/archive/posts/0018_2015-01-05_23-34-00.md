# 【No. 0018】Linear Relationship
<div class="date">Jan 5, 2015 23:34</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I dictated the dialogues of the "Frozen" as with yesterday.<br/><br/>3 hours after I started, just 80% of the all dialogues were completed.<br/><br/>In other words, it took 3 hours to complete 30% today.<br/><br/>Also, it took 5 hours to complete 50% yesterday.<br/><br/>Oh, I found a beautiful linear relationship between required time and progress rate.<br/><br/>It can be easily estimated that I need further 2 hours to complete dictation.<br/><br/>But today, there was one thing that I couldn't understand even using my dictionaries.<br/><br/>Kristoff said "feisty-pants" to Anna.<br/><br/>Wha..what's the "pants"? Are the pants that pants?<br/><br/>I thought it means something like "feisty baby" judging from that situation.<br/><br/>However, I have no idea why "pants".<br/><br/>I would be happy if you could help me.

 "feisty-pants" is a spin off of a phrase "smarty-pants" :) calling someone a "smarty-pants" can be teasing or insulting depending on context, but usually teasing :) i'm sure there are many other "-pants" phrases.
