# <strong><em>Kuromaku</strong></em> (A Black Curtain)
<div class="date">Jan 10, 2017 21:46</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese word "kuromaku".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "a black curtain", and it means "a person who gives instructions under the counter", or "a person who has real power".<br/><br/>This word comes from a tool that is used in Kabuki (traditional Japanese drama performed by male actors).<br/><br/>In the Kabuki, a black curtain is used for hiding the stage when the scene is changing, or showing a night scene.<br/><br/>Since operations of the stage were conducted behind the black curtain, "a person who has influence behind the curtain" came to be referred to as "kuromaku" (a black curtain).

黒幕<br/><br/>今日は「黒幕」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>文字通りの意味は "a black curtain" であり、「裏で指示を出す人」や「実権を握っている人」のことを表します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、歌舞伎の芝居で用いる道具に由来します。<br/><br/>歌舞伎では、場面の変わり目に舞台を隠したり、夜の場面を表すために、黒い幕を張ります。<br/><br/>舞台の操作や芝居の進行は、この黒い幕の裏で行われていたことから、「裏で影響力を行使する人」のことを「黒幕」と呼ぶようになりました。

 In English there's "the man behind the curtain" from the Wizard of Oz.
