# 【No. 0612】<strong><em>Pin kara Kiri made</em></strong> (From Pin to Kiri)
<div class="date">Aug 21, 2016 10:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese phrase "pin kara kiri made," which means "from the first to the last" / "whole gamut."<br/><br/>The "pin" comes from the Portuguese "pinta," which means "point."<br/><br/>This became to express "one" of a dice, then became to mean "the first" or "the best."<br/><br/>The "kiri" means "the last" or "the worst."<br/><br/>There are two theories about the etymology: one is that it comes from the Portuguese "cruz," which means "cross," and the other is that it comes from the Japanese "kagiri," which means "limit."<br/><br/>Recently, Japanese people often say just "pin kiri" for short.

ピンからキリまで<br/><br/>今日は、「最初から最後まで / 全範囲」を意味する「ピンからキリまで」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ピン」は「点」を意味するポルトガル語 "pinta" に由来します。<br/><br/>これがサイコロなどで「一」を表すようになり、転じて「最初の」「最高の」という意味になりました。<br/><br/>「キリ」は「最後の」「最低の」を意味します。<br/><br/>語源は、「十字架」を意味するポルトガル語 "cruz" から転じたという説と、日本語の「限り」から来たという説があります。<br/><br/>最近は「ピンからキリまで」を省略して「ピンキリ」と言う人も多いです。

 &gt;The "pin" comes from the Portuguese "pinta," which means "point."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 OK. Being Portuguese I guess I can help here.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "pinta" is not really "point". Point is "ponto".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Pinta" is more like a very small spot. Like a small color filled ball.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Like you say a fabric has "pintas" if it's something like this:

 </a>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 &gt; This became to express "one" of a dice
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yes, "pinta" can be used there. Now it makes sense.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 First time I've heard of this garaigo...
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From karuta to this, you guys really liked the games we took...
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Thank you for teaching me this.

I meant to write:<br/><br/>Even natives get these wrong quite frequently.

Thank you very much for the corrections and helpful explanations!<br/><br/>I learned something new :)<br/>(I didn't know the singular form of dice)<br/><br/>There are a lot of Portuguese loanwords in Japan. It's very interesting.
