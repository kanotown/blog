<h1 id="subject_show">The Meaning of "まめ"</h1>
<div class="date">Jul 24, 2015 14:28</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to introduce a Japanese word "まめ."<br/><br/>If this word was written in kanji, such as "豆," it would mean "bean."<br/><br/>However, we sometimes use it as a prefix, and then the meaning is "small."<br/><br/>For example, we use it like "豆知識(まめちしき：bits of knowledge)," "豆電球(まめでんきゅう：fairy lights)," "豆鉄砲（まめでっぽう：popgun）."<br/><br/>"まめ" has also the adjective meaning of "dedicated" or "organized."<br/><br/>If "まめ" was used as an adjective meaning, it would include various good meanings.<br/><br/>If we say "あなたはまめな人だね(you're an dedicated person)," this will mean praise, but don't say "あなたはまめのような人だね(You're a person like bean)."<br/><br/>"あなたはまめのような人だね" means something like "you're a small person" or "you're an intolerant person."<br/><br/>Incidentally, "まめ" also means "blister" and "foot corn."
