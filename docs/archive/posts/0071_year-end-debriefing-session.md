<div class="date">Feb 27, 2015 20:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Today, the year-end debriefing session of various organizations in our university was held. Some people presented their research, and some people presented their venture activity. We also presented about our software development venture and our projects. It was the exciting event, and I learned a lot from many other organizations. After the debriefing session, we participated a banquet and ate delicious dinner.
