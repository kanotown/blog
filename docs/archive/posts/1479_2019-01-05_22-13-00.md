<div class="date">Jan 5, 2019 22:13</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kado ga Toreru</strong></em><br/><br/>When someone who is harsh becomes to have a gentle nature due to his/her life experience, it is expressed as <strong><em>kado ga toreru</em></strong> (角が取れる) in Japanese.<br/><br/><strong><em>Kado</em></strong> (角) usually means "corner," but here it means a sharp point of one's personality.<br/><br/>In addition, <strong><em>toreru</em></strong> (取れる) means "to remove" or "to come off."<br/><br/>Therefore, <em>kadoga toreru</em> means that a sharp part of one's personality removes, in other words, it means that one's personality becomes gentle or mellow.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I watched the movie "A Christmas Carol," and I thought that this term can be is used for Scrooge.

角が取れる<br/><br/>人生経験を経て尖った性格が穏やかになることを、日本語で「角が取れる」と言います。<br/><br/>「角」は "corner" を意味しますが、ここでは性格の尖っている部分のことを表しています。<br/><br/>また、「取れる」は "to remove" や "to come off" を意味します。<br/><br/>したがって「角が取れる」とは、性格の尖っている部分が取れることであり、それはすなわち性格が穏やかになるということです。<br/><br/>私は一昨日、映画「クリスマスキャロル」を見たのですが、スクルージにこの表現が使えると思いました。

On second thought, I think it would be clearer to translate it as "to be removed"
