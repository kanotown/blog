宴<br/><br/>昨日は私の職場で「宴」が行われました。<br/><br/>「宴」とは、宴会や飲み会のことを表します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、手や楽器を叩いて音を出す「打ち上げ」が変化したものです。<br/><br/>音を出して騒ぐことから、騒がしい飲み会を指すようになったというわけです。<br/><br/>現在では、興行を終えた際に行う宴会のことを「打ち上げ」と言うこともあります。<br/><br/>また、宴は通常、企業や団体などが行うある程度規模の大きいパーティを指し、「宴会」と呼ばれることも多いです。<br/><br/>一方、若者が行う小規模なパーティは、単に「飲み会」と呼ばることが多いです。
