<div class="date">Dec 13, 2015 13:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Have you ever feel like a year passes by faster?<br/><br/>In the 19th century, a French philosopher Janet invented a law.<br/><br/>It is something like that the length of years that are memorized subjectively is evaluated as; longer for young persons, shorter for elders.<br/><br/>According to Janet, for five-years-olds one year is one-fifth of their life, while for fifty-years-olds one year is one-fiftieth, so there is a difference of 10 times in the perceptions of their one year.<br/><br/>It is also said that as we get older, fresh experiences decrease and lives become monotonous, so we become to feel like a year passes by faster.<br/><br/>As long as we continue new challenges every day, we might be able to spend quality time at any age.

ジャネーの法則<br/><br/>最近、一年が早く感じることがありませんか？<br/><br/>19世紀、フランスの哲学者ジャネーはある法則を発案しました。<br/><br/>それは、主観的に記憶される年月の長さは年少者にはより長く、年長者にはより短く評価されるというものです。<br/><br/>彼によると、5歳における1年は人生の1/5なのに対し、50歳における1年は人生の1/50であるため、1年の感覚に10倍の差があるとのことです。<br/><br/>また、年を重ねると新鮮な経験が減って単調になるため、1年が早く経つようになるとも言われています。<br/><br/>毎日新しい挑戦を続けていれば、年齢に関係なく充実した時間を過ごせるかもしれません。

<p class="correction_comment">Although "quality time" might seem to mean the same thing...as a phrase, it has a slightly different meaning in English. For instance, people say "spend quality time with my kids" (which means special time where they can interact in a meaningful way).</p>
