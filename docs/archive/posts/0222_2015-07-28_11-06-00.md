# 【No. 0222】A(la) 440 Hz
<div class="date">Jul 28, 2015 11:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned about a frequency of babies cry.<br/><br/>The frequency is always 440 Hz, which is the music node A (also called la).<br/><br/>Surprisingly, this law can be applied for not only human babies, but also babies of every mammal.<br/><br/>The reason why the frequency is constant has not been revealed yet, but there are some hypotheses.<br/><br/>According to the one hypothesis, the frequency 440 Hz is stimulate us, and babies seem to try to wake us.<br/><br/>By the way, orchestras tune their instruments using the music node A(440 Hz).<br/><br/>Also, the international standard pitch has been determined to 440 Hz at the conference in London.

Today, I learned about <span class="f_red">the frequency that babies cry [at]</span>.
<p class="correction_comment">According to physics, sound propagates "at a frequency". So, instead of "a frequency of babies cry", you should say "the frequency that babies cry at".</p>

<li class="corrected correct">
The reason why the frequency <span class="f_red">stays constant [between mammals]</span> has not been <span class="f_red">discovered</span> yet, but there are some hypotheses.
<p class="correction_comment">You don't need to say "between mammals", but I prefer to say it. As for "is constant", "stays constant" is much better sounding.<br/><br/>Also, "revealed" makes it sound like the reason for the frequency's constancy is being hidden from us. But the fact is that we just don't know it yet, so we're waiting for it to be "discovered"!</p>

<p class="comment_small">
 Overall, good job! It's really interesting that 440Hz seems to be such a universal frequency XD.
