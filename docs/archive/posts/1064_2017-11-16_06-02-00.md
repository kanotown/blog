<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Now I'm doing my work, which is called "yonabe" (夜なべ).<br/><br/>"Yonabe" means a work that is done in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>The "yo" (夜) means "night," but there are several theories about what the "nabe" (なべ) means.<br/><br/>The most accepted theory says that the "nabe" is written in kanji as"鍋," which means a one pot dish.<br/><br/>According to this theory, the word "yonabe" comes from the fact that people work at night while eating "nabe" (one pot dish).<br/><br/>Also, another theory says that "nabe" is written in kanji as "延べ," which means "extension" -- this implies that your work is extended until night.

夜なべ<br/><br/>私は今、「夜なべ」しています。<br/><br/>「夜なべ」とは、夜中に行う仕事のことを意味します。<br/><br/>「夜」は "night" を意味しますが、「なべ」が何を意味するかについては幾つかの説が存在します。<br/><br/>最も有力な説は、「なべ」を「鍋」と考えたものです。<br/><br/>この説では、夜に鍋を食べながら仕事をしたことが「夜なべ」の語源であるとしています。<br/><br/>また、「なべ」を「延べ」と考え、仕事が夜遅くまで延びたことが「夜なべ」の語源と考える説もあります。
