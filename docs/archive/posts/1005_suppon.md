# 【No. 1005】<strong><em>Suppon</strong></em> (スッポン - Soft-Shell Turtle)
<div class="date">Sep 18, 2017 15:26</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Previously, I introduced the Japanese phrase, "tsuki to suppon" (月とスッポン), which means that two things are very different from each other, though they have something in common.<br/><br/>Today, I will talk about the "suppon" (スッポン) of "tsuki to suppon."<br/><br/>"Suppon" means a soft-shell turtle, and is widely distributed in China, Japan, Russia and etc.<br/><br/>Especially in Japan and China, people have eaten suppons since a long time ago.<br/>In Japan, the word "suppon" has been used since the Edo period, but before that it had been called "dorogame" (ドロガメ), the literal meaning of which is "mud turtle."<br/><br/>The etymology of "suppon" hasn't been clarified yet, but it's said that it comes from an onomatopoeia when a suppon makes a plunge into a river.

スッポン<br/><br/>私は以前、「共通点はあるけど比較にならない」という意味の「月とスッポン」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>今日は「スッポン」という言葉について紹介します。<br/><br/>「スッポン」はカメの一種で、中国や日本、ロシアなどに広く分布しています。<br/><br/>特に日本や中国では、スッポンは古くより食されてきました。<br/><br/>日本で「スッポン」という言葉が使われるようになったのは江戸時代以降で、それ以前は泥の中で生活することから「ドロガメ」と呼ばれていました。<br/><br/>このような名前になった理由は明らかになっていませんが、スッポンが川に飛び込んだ際の擬音から来ている説などがあります。
