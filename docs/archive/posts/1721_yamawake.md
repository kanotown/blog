# 【No. 1721】<strong><em>Yamawake</em></strong> (山分け - Dividing Equally)
<div class="date">Sep 3, 2019 22:04</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Yamawake</em></strong><br/><br/>A few days ago, I introduced the term <strong><em>osusowake</em></strong> (おすそわけ), which means to distribute goods or benefits that you received to your friends or others.<br/><br/>Another Japanese term, <strong><em>yamawake</em></strong> (山分け), is a little similar to <em>osusowake</em>.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>yama</em></strong> (山) means "mountain" and <strong><em>wake</em></strong> (分け) means "to distribute/divide," the literal meaning of <em>yamawake</em> is "to divide a mountain."<br/><br/>Actually, <em>yamawake</em> means to divide something you obtained into two (equally) with someone.<br/><br/>It is said that this term comes from a small symmetrical mountain called Komezuka (米塚) in Kumamoto.<br/><br/>The Komezuka has a vertical crack in the center -- it looks like the mountain is divided into two.

山分け<br/><br/>数日前、人からもらったものを友人や知人に分け与えることを意味する「おすそわけ」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>「おすそわけ」と似た言葉に「山分け」があります。<br/><br/>「山」は "mountain"、「分け」は "to divide/distribute" を意味するので、「山分け」の文字どおりの意味は "to divide a mountain" となります。<br/><br/>実際には、「手に入れたものを誰かと半分（もしくは人数に合わせて等分）に分けること」を意味します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、熊本県にある米塚と呼ばれる均整のとれた小山に由来すると言われています。<br/><br/>この米塚には、山を二つに分けるように中央に亀裂が入っています。
