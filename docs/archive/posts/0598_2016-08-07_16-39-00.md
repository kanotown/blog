<div class="date">Aug 7, 2016 16:39</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Rio Olympic Games began yesterday.<br/><br/>Today, I'd like to talk about some Olympic trivia related to Japan.<br/><br/>In the Stockholm Summer Games in 1912, Japan participated in an Olympic for the first time, and the event was men's track and field.<br/><br/>In the Amsterdam Summer Games in 1928, Japan got the first gold medal in a triple jump.<br/><br/>Also, recent Japanese medalists often take a picture while biting the medals.<br/><br/>(The first person to bite a medal was Armstrong, which won the men's swimming 200 m free style in the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988. It is said that the reason why he bit his gold medal is to check whether or not the medal was real gold.)<br/><br/>There are pros and cons about the biting act, but Japanese Olympic Committee decided officially that biting medals is a prohibited act from the Sochi Winter Games in 2014.

日本におけるオリンピックの雑学<br/><br/>昨日、リオオリンピックが始まりました。<br/><br/>今日は、日本におけるオリンピックの雑学を幾つか紹介します。<br/><br/>日本が初めてオリンピックに参加したのは、1912年のストックホルム夏季大会で、競技は陸上男子のみでした。<br/><br/>日本人初の金メダルは、1928年のアムステルダム夏季大会で、競技は三段跳びです。<br/><br/>また、最近の日本人選手の間では、メダルを獲得するとかじって写真を撮ることが恒例になっていました。<br/><br/>（一番最初にメダルを噛んだのは、1988年のソウルオリンピックの男子水泳200ｍ自由形で優勝したアームストロング選手であり、本物の金かどうかを確かめるためだったと言われています。）<br/><br/>メダルをかじる行為については賛否両論ありますが、日本オリンピック委員会は、2014年のソチ冬季オリンピックからメダルを噛むこと公式に禁止したそうです。
