プレーリードッグ<br/><br/>今日はリス科のプレーリードッグについて話します。<br/><br/>プレーリードッグは北米の草原地帯に生息し、穴をほって巣穴を作り、群れで生活します。<br/><br/>雄一匹に対し雌数匹の一夫多妻制で、コテリーと呼ばれる家族集団を形成します。<br/><br/>コテリーは同じ巣穴で暮らし、餌を分け合ったり、外部から来た雄を追い出したりと、仲間意識が強いです。<br/><br/>また、彼らはキスをしたり、抱き合ったりして挨拶を交すことで知られています。<br/><br/>ちなみに、プレーリードッグが作る巣穴は、寝室、子供部屋、トイレ、食料庫、見張所など、役割によって部屋が分かれているようです。
