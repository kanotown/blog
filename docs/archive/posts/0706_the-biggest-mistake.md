最大のミス<br/><br/>私は昨日、とても大きな失態を犯しました。<br/><br/>700日以上、必ず毎日一回Lang-8に文章を投稿してきましたが、それは昨日で終わってしまいました。<br/><br/>私はいつものように記事を書き、「投稿する」ボタンを押したつもりでいました。<br/><br/>しかし、投稿できていませんでした。<br/><br/>ネットワークの不良か私のミスか今となってはわかりません。<br/><br/>とても悲しいです。<br/><br/>カレンダーに空白ができてしまいましたが、実質的には毎日英語の学習を続けているという事実を糧に、これからまた頑張っていこうと思います。

<p class="correction_comment">There is nothing wrong with using the word "believe", but "thought" seems more natural. I put a comma infront of "as always" because it is a phrase that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence. You put a comma before to indicate the beginning of the pause and one after to indicate to end of the pause.<br/><br/>An example sentence: This hamburger is delicious. The French fries, on the other hand, are not delicious.<br/><br/>So, the phrase "on the other hand" is not essential to the sentence so we put a comma infront and after to indicate the pause and end of the pause. The reason it is not essentials is because, saying "The French fries are not delicious" is just as acceptable as the latter. Hope this is understadable. If not feel free to ask me any other questions :)</p>
