# <strong><em>Oyadama</strong></em> (親玉 - Godfather)
<div class="date">Apr 8, 2018 09:07</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I sometimes use the Japanese word "oyadama" (親玉).<br/><br/>"Oyadama" means a key person or leader in organizations.<br/><br/>"Oya" (親) means "parent" and "dama/tama" (玉) means "ball," so the literal meaning of "oyadama" is "parent ball."<br/><br/>Originally, this word was used to mean a big ball set in the center of "juzu" (数珠).<br/><br/>"Juzu" is a tool that is made by connecting a large ball (oyadama) and many small balls in a circle, and it is used when praying in Buddhism.<br/><br/>Since the small balls are arranged around the big ball, "oyadama" has come to mean a centerpiece, key person or leader.<br/><br/>Note that this word is often used in a bad sense, such as "aku no oyadama" (悪の親玉 - master of evil), though I don't know the reason.

親玉<br/><br/>私は「親玉」という言葉を時々使います。<br/><br/>「親玉」は、団体や組織における中心的人物や、ボスのことを指す言葉です。<br/><br/>親は "parent," 玉は "ball" を意味するので、親玉の文字通りの意味は "parent ball" となります。<br/><br/>もともとこの言葉は、数珠の中心にある大きな玉を指しました。<br/><br/>数珠は、大きな玉（親玉）の周りに小さな玉を繋げて輪にした道具で、仏教において祈りの際に使われます。<br/><br/>ここから、組織などにおける中心的存在を指すようになったというわけです。<br/><br/>理由はわかりませんが、親玉は「悪の親玉」など悪い意味で使われることが多いので、注意して下さい。

 “Godfather” has sort of a negative connotation in English too.  Have you see the famous movie “The Godfather”?  When I hear that word I think of the mafia.  Though there are other uses for “Godfather” that are not negative.  As close frien ]d who you chose to raise or care for your child should so,etching happen to you can be a Godfather.

Thank you so much for reading my post!<br/>Yes, I've seen the movie "The Godfather." I think that many Japanese people would image something like a leader who appears in the movie. Such a positive usage for "Godfather" is very interesting. Thank you for letting me know that. :)

 I have never seen it but is Dragon Ball like this too?
</p>

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/>I think that it has no special relationship with Dragon Ball. However, some "oyadama" appear in the world of Dragon Ball. One of the most famous "oyadama" is Frieza.
