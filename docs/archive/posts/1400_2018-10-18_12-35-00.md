どじ<br/><br/>恐らく私は「どじ」です。<br/><br/>「どじ」とは、間の抜けた失敗や、そのような失敗をする人を指す言葉です。<br/><br/>正確なことはわかっていませんが、「どじ」の語源は以下のように諸説あります。<br/><br/>遅くて鈍いことを意味する「鈍遅（どんち/どぢ）」が変化したという説。<br/><br/>失敗することを意味する「とちる」が変化したという説。<br/><br/>あわてるという意味の「とちめんぼう」を略したという説。<br/><br/>はっきりしないさまを意味する「どちぐち」を略したという説。<br/><br/>この言葉は、以前紹介した「間抜け」や「ぼんくら」という言葉と似ています。
