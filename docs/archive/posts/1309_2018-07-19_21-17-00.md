# <strong><em>Ukkari</strong></em> (うっかり - Carelessly)
<div class="date">Jul 19, 2018 21:17</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Ukkari</strong></em><br/><br/>Several days ago, I <strong><em>ukkari</em></strong> (うっかり) made a mistake.<br/><br/><em>Ukkari</em> is a Japanese adverb that represents that someone is careless and distracted. <br/><br/><em>Ukkari</em> was originally called <strong><em>ukari</em></strong> (浮かり), and it seemed to come from the verb <strong><em>uku</em></strong> (浮く), which means to float.<br/><br/>That is to say, it implies a state that one's heart is floating.<br/><br/>I heard that in the past <em>ukkari</em> could represent that someone would be fascinated with a beautiful thing, but now it is mostly used to mean a mistake due to carelessness or distraction.

うっかり<br/><br/>私は先日、「うっかり」ミスをしてしまいました。<br/><br/>「うっかり」とは、ぼんやりして注意が散漫になるさまをあらわす副詞です。<br/><br/>もともとは「浮かり」といい、「浮く」からきたと考えられています。<br/><br/>「心が浮いているような状態」を表しているというわけです。<br/><br/>かつては「美しいものに心を奪われてうっとりするさま」も表していたようですが、現在ではほとんど「ぼんやりして失敗するさま」を表す際に使われます。
