<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I was interviewed for an assistant professor.<br/><br/>Since it might decide my life, I was very nervous.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, my preparation wasn't enough, so I was bewildered by some questions, and wasn't able to answer them well.<br/><br/>I am depressed now.<br/><br/>However, I will no doubt resurge tomorrow.<br/><br/>Actually, I drove more than 500 km for today's job interview, so I am super exhausted and I will sleep soon.

初めての面接<br/><br/>今日は大学教員の面接を受けました。<br/><br/>自分の人生が決まる可能性があるので、とても緊張しました。<br/><br/>残念ながら準備が少し疎かだったため、幾つかの質問に慌ててしまい、うまく答えられませんでした。<br/><br/>落ち込んでいます。<br/><br/>でも、きっと明日には復活します。<br/><br/>今日は面接を受けるため500km以上運転してくたくたなので、早めに寝ます。

 Hey Kanotownさん！
 <br/>
 Just treat it as an experience I guess. Interviews are definitely scary but once you get through a few of them and got used to it, you will feel like they are nothing at all ^^
