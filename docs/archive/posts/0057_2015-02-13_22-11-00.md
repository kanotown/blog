# Interesting Programmer's English
<div class="date">Feb 13, 2015 22:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned some English phrases used by programmers, and I think they were interesting. So I'd like to introduce some of them.<br/><br/>"I'm teenager in hex." or "I'm 20's in hex."<br/>10 to 1F in hex means 16 to 31 in decimal, and 20 to 2F in hex means 32 to 47 in decimal. So I can say "I'm teenager in hex," hehe. If you say your age in hex, it's possible to pretend as if you're young.<br/><br/>"I took a core dump."<br/>This means I drank too much or I puked. Core dump is an original memory file and it is spat up when a fatal error occurs. Anyway, this phrase This phrase represent like I'm really out of shape.<br/><br/>"She is Haskell."<br/>This means she is really pure, but it's difficult to approach.<br/><br/>"He created a Lisp implementation in PostScript."<br/>This means he is a freak.<br/>

I don't think these are very common, and I wouldn't understand them without explanation despite being a programmer. But they are quite funny.
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
Yes, I think these are used by just a part of programmers. :)

 I didn't know about these expressions before now, and I'm a computer engineer.

 I'm also a teenager in hex... until August, anyway.
