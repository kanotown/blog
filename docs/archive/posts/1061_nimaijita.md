# 【No. 1061】<strong><em>Nimaijita</em></strong> (二枚舌 - Double Tongue)
<div class="date">Nov 13, 2017 11:33</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are several Japanese expressions that means to tell a lie.<br/><br/>The term "nimaijita" (二枚舌) is one of them.<br/><br/>The "nimai" (二枚) means "two pieces," and the "jita/shita" (舌) means "tongue," so the literal meaning of "nimaijita" is "two tongues."<br/><br/>However, this term is used to mean that someone tells a lie or say contradictory things.<br/><br/>Since people who say lies or contradictions fluently are as if they have two tongues and each one says different things, this term has come to be used.<br/><br/>Incidentally, today I learned English has a similar expression -- "speaking with a forked tongue" means to tell a lie.

二枚舌<br/><br/>嘘をつくことを意味する表現はさまざまあります。<br/><br/>「二枚舌」もその一つです。<br/><br/>「二枚舌」の文字どおりの意味は「二枚の舌」ですが、実際には嘘をつことや、矛盾したことを言うという意味で使われます。<br/><br/>平気で嘘や矛盾したことを言う人は、口の中に二枚の舌があり、それぞれ違ったことを言っているようであることから、この言葉が使われるようになりました。<br/><br/>英語でも同じように "speaking with a forked tongue" （枝分かれした舌で話す）と言うと、嘘をつくという意味になります。
