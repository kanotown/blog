# 【No. 0942】<strong><em>Kiseru</em></strong> (キセル)
<div class="date">Jul 17, 2017 18:07</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A kiseru is a kind of smoking tools in Japan, and its structure and form are similar to pipes.<br/><br/>General pipes are made of metals (except bowls), whereas kiserus use metals only for mouthpiece parts and bowls, and use bamboo for other parts.<br/><br/>Therefore, you can suck on the kiseru about only three times after you light it.<br/><br/>The term, "kiseru," can also mean an act of cheating on a train fare.<br/><br/>This is derived from kiseru's structure -- there are metals only on the entrance and the exit.<br/>(In Japan, 金 of 金属 (which means metals) can imply money.)<br/><br/>Incidentally, it's thought that the word "kiseru" comes from "ksher," which means pipe in Cambodian language.

キセル<br/><br/>キセルは日本の喫煙具の一種で、その構造や造形はパイプとよく似ています。<br/><br/>一般的なパイプは金属製ですが、キセルは刻み煙草を詰める火皿と口に咥える吸口の部分だけが金属となっており、管の部分は竹が使用されます。<br/><br/>このため、キセルは3口くらい吸うと終わってしまいます。<br/><br/>キセルという言葉は、乗降駅付近の乗車券を使い、中間区間を無賃乗車する行為も指します。<br/><br/>これは、キセルの入り口と出口にのみ金属を使っているキセルの構造に由来しています。<br/><br/>ちなみに、キセルという言葉自体はカンボジア語で管を意味する「ksher（クセル）」から来ていると考えられています。

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/><br/>&gt; When where they invented in Japan?<br/>According to the Internet, they were imported from Cambodia in 1603.<br/>Maybe I should had to write something like "A kiseru is a smoking tool that is used in Japan" instead of "A kiseru is a smoking tool in Japan."

 キセルの意味はわかっているけれど（ゲームで知った）、キセル乗車は初耳です。

 また一つ勉強になりました～ありがとう(●´ー｀●)

コメントありがとう、スイちゃん :)<br/>最近では喫煙具としてのキセルはあまり使われなくなってきているので、キセルと言えばキセル乗車を表すことが多いと思います。
