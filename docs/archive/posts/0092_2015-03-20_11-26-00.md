# Traffic Light Color
<div class="date">Mar 20, 2015 11:26</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Traffic light colors are based on universal standard. According to the International Commission on Illumination (CIE), colors that can be used for traffic lights are "red, yellow, green, blue, purple and white," but we use only "red, yellow and blue-green" in most cases. Although a green light might look completely green, the actual color is usually blue-green. Since our eyes are sensitive to green, we view the blue-green light to be green light.<br/><br/>　Also, Japanese people refer to a green light as "青信号 (blue light)," though, we look it's green. It is said that the reason is that we represented all colors from green to blue using only the word "blue," or we thought the contrast of red is blue.

　信号機の色は世界共通です。国際照明委員会（CIE）によると、信号機に使える色は「赤・黄・緑・青・紫・白」の6つですが、我々は大抵「赤・黄・青緑」を使います。青（緑）信号は完全に緑色に見えるかもしれませんが、実は青緑であることが多いです。我々の目は緑色を敏感に感じるようになっているので、青緑色が完全に緑に見えるのです。<br/><br/>　また、日本では青（緑）信号のことを、緑色に見えるにも関わらず、青信号と呼んでいます。これは、日本では昔から緑から青にかけての色を全て「青」と表現していたことや、「赤」の対比が「青」とされてきたことに起因すると考えられています。

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>I think most English speaker use the word "green light," so I want to use "green light" instead of "blue light" in this sentence, but is it unnatural?

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; that we represent all colors from green to blue using only the word "blue," or we think the contrast of red is blue.<br/>Actually, these are historical stories in Japan. So maybe I have to use a "past perfect." Also, I heard the red's complementary/opponent color is blue-green. I'm sometimes confused because there are several color theories.<br/><br/>&gt; I hear it is slightly blue so green-red colorblind people can see the difference.<br/>Oh, it's a really brilliant idea!! I learned something new!
