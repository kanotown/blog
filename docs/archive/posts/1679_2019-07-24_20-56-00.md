<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Deer in Nara<br/><br/>Today I came to Nara to participate in an academic conference.<br/><br/>The conference venue was near Nara Park, which is famous for deer, so I saw a lot of deer on the way to the venue.<br/><br/>According to a survey, the number of deer living in Nara Park is about 1400.<br/><br/>Indeed, I felt that there were deer everywhere in the park.<br/><br/>Furthermore, since there were a lot of deer droppings, it was not easy to avoid them.<br/><br/>Incidentally, when I got on a bus to go to a hotel I reserved, the bus was crowded, and a child kicked my pants.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, his shoes were very dirty -- probably he stepped on a lot of deer droppings.

奈良の鹿<br/><br/>今日は学会参加のため、奈良県に来ています。<br/><br/>会場は鹿で有名な奈良公園の近くに位置しているので、会場に向かう途中多くの鹿を見かけました。<br/><br/>ある調査によると、奈良公園に生息する鹿の数は、現在約1400頭だそうです。<br/><br/>確かに、いたるところ鹿であふれていたように感じました。<br/><br/>そして、いたるところに鹿の糞があり、避けるのが大変でした。<br/><br/>ちなみに、帰りにバスに乗ったところ、混雑していて、子供にズボンを蹴られました。<br/><br/>その子供の靴を見ると、大量の鹿の糞を踏んだ跡がありました。
