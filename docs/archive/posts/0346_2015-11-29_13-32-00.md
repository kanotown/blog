# 【No. 0346】Cats and Fish
<div class="date">Nov 29, 2015 13:32</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Japan, the image that favorite food of cats is fish has been established.<br/><br/>In fact, Japanese sometimes feed cats with fish.<br/><br/>However, if cats continue to eat blue-skinned fish, cats may be sick and die.<br/><br/>I think such an image that cats like fish should be modified.<br/><br/>Also,  it seems to be a common sense that cats mainly eat meats in the world.<br/><br/>By the way, I heard that cats in the US eat pizza, cats in Italy eat pasta, and cats in India eat curry.

猫と魚<br/><br/>日本では、猫の好物は魚というイメージが定着しています。<br/><br/>実際、日本人は猫に魚を与えることがあります。<br/><br/>しかし、猫は青魚を食べ続けると病気になって死んでしまうそうです。<br/><br/>猫が魚好きというイメージは修正する必要があると思います。<br/><br/>また、世界的には猫は主に肉を食べるのが常識のようです。<br/><br/>ただ、アメリカの猫はピザ、イタリアの猫はパスタ、インドの猫はカレーを食べるようです。

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>Yes, in fact, there are some websites that collect photos of cats and pizza. I also think pizza is not good for their health.

 Interesting! But what about sushi? Do they like them?
</p>

Thank you very much always for correcting my post! :)<br/>I didn't think about sushi. I think cats like sushi too, but most Japanese won't feed them with sushi, because sushi is expensive, haha.
