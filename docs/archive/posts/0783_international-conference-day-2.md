<div class="date">Feb 9, 2017 07:56</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today was Day 2 of the international conference, and it was the day of my presentation.<br/><br/>I was super nervous and I thought I was going to vomit..<br/><br/>Then finally, the presentation was performed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I couldn't speak well.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the question and answer session was really awful.<br/><br/>I was sad.<br/><br/>After the presentation, I acted with other Japanese participants.<br/><br/>In a reception of the conference, cheeses were all-you-can-eat and many kinds of beer were all-you-can-drink.<br/><br/>While listening to live performance of string instruments, we got a lot of delicious beer and cheese.<br/><br/>However, since I drank beer too much, I have a head ache.

学会二日目<br/><br/>今日は学会の2日目で、いよいよ私のプレゼンの日です。<br/><br/>ものすごく緊張して吐きそうでした。<br/><br/>そして、発表が行われました。<br/><br/>残念ながら、かなりぐだぐだな発表になってしまいました、<br/><br/>そして、質疑応答もうまくいきませんでした。<br/><br/>悲しいです。<br/><br/>その後は、日本人の参加者と一緒に行動しました。<br/><br/>学会のレセプションでは、チーズが食べ放題で、ビールが飲み放題でした。<br/><br/>弦楽器の生演奏を聞きながら、とても美味しいビールとチーズを沢山頂きました。<br/><br/>しかし、ビールを飲みすぎて今は頭が痛いです。

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; What do you mean you "acted"? I don't understand.<br/>I wanted to say something like<br/>"I ate lunch with them, I heard presentations with them, and I drank beer with them, etc."<br/>I used the verb "act" instead of using various verbs.

&gt; I used the verb "act" instead of using various verbs.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone would understand that. This is a serious point!<br/><br/>I can't think of a natural and short alternative to replace that.<br/>Maybe some native speaker could help.<br/><br/>On another note, those events are a place where you should interact with non Japanese.<br/>To "act" with fellow Japanese you could have just stayed in Tokyo, no need to fly for 20 something hours.<br/><br/>

Thank you for the advice :)<br/>As you said, I think that we should have interact with more foreign researchers. It must be one of the most regrettable failures in this conference.
