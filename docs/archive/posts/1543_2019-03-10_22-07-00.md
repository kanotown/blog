<strong><em>Jucchū Hakku</strong></em><br/><br/>To express that possibility is high or something is most likely to happen, you can use the four-character idiom <strong><em>jucchū hakku</em></strong> (十中八九)<br/><br/><strong><em>Ju/jū</em></strong> (十) means "ten," <strong><em>chū</em></strong> (中) means "in" or "inside," <strong><em>ha/hachi</em></strong> (八) means "eight," and <strong><em>ku/kyū</em></strong> (九) means "nine."<br/><br/>That is to say, <em>jucchū hakku</em> means that the possibility is eight or nine when the total of the possibility is ten.<br/><br/>In other words, it means that the possibility is 80% to 90%.<br/><br/>[Example] <strong><em>Ashita wa jucchū hakku hareru</em></strong> (明日は十中八九晴れる - "Ten to one it will be fine tomorrow.")

十中八九<br/><br/>可能性の高やほとんど確実であることを表す四字熟語に「十中八九」があります。<br/><br/>「十」は "ten"、「中」は "in/inside"、「八」は "eight"、「九」は "nine" を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち「十中八九」とは、可能性の全体を10としたとき、8か9でそれが起こるということを表します。<br/><br/>言い換えると、可能性が「80％～90%」というわけです。<br/><br/>【例文】明日は十中八九晴れる。

<p class="correction_comment">Usually, we don't use "possibility" with numbers. Instead, we use "probability."<br/><br/>o "There is a possibility that..." <br/>? "There is not much possibility..."<br/>?? "There is a 3% possibility..."<br/><br/>It's like the difference between 可能 and 確率, I think.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">I have to explain some betting language...<br/><br/>a "ten to one chance" or "ten to one odds" means that the event is quite unlikely (one in ten). If you place a bet of 1 and the bet succeeds, you get back 10.<br/><br/>Odds of "ten to one on" is the opposite. It is very likely to happen. If you place a bet at odds of "ten to one on", for every 10 that you bet, if you win, you get back 11. (literally "ten plus one on" = 11)</p>
