すみません<br/><br/>日本では、謝罪や感謝の気持ちを表す時、よく「すみません」と言います。<br/><br/>「すみません」は「すまぬ」の丁寧な形で、「すまぬ」は動詞「済む」に打ち消しの「ぬ」がついた言葉です。<br/><br/>ここで「済む」は、「仕事が終わる」「物事が解決する」のような意味で、「気持ちがはれる」「気持ちが安らぐ」などを意味することもあります。<br/><br/>すなわち、「済む」の否定である「すみません」は、「気持ちがはれない」ことを意味します。<br/><br/>誰かに迷惑をかけたり、手間を大いにかけて助けてもらったら、あなたの気持ちははれず、満足もできないと思います。<br/><br/>このことから、「すみません」は謝罪や感謝の気持ちを表す際に利用されるようになりました。
