ドタキャン<br/><br/>私は昨日、最終局面を意味する「土壇場」という日本語を紹介しました。<br/><br/>この「土壇場」から派生した俗語に「ドタキャン」があります。<br/><br/>「ドタキャン」は、「土壇場でキャンセル」を略した言葉で、予定の直前になって約束を取り消すことを意味します。<br/><br/>もともとこの言葉は、芸能界や旅行業界などで用いられた業界用語でしたが、1990年頃から（特に若者の間で）一般的に使われるようになりました。<br/><br/>ドタキャンは人を傷つけるだけでなく、あなた自身の信用も失われるので、しないようにしましょう。

 One mistake that many Japanese speakers make is use the word "introduce" without an indirect object in cases when that seems strange to native speakers. "Yesterday, I introduced YOU to the word Dotanba," is better.

 This was very interesting. Is 「彼女はいつもドタンバします」the correct way to use this word?
</p>

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/>&gt; Is 「彼女はいつもドタンバします」the correct way to use this word?<br/>「彼女はいつもドタンバします」 sounds unnatural, because ドタンバ（土壇場）is a word that means a kind of situation.「彼女はいつもドタキャンします」 is perfectly fine.
