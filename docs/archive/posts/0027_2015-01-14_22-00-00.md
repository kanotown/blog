<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Two months ago, I forgot to prepare my mother's birthday present.<br/><br/>And after one month from now, I will go back to my hometown for some reason.<br/><br/>Since I want to give my mother a present at that time, I bought a SSD today.<br/><br/>Of course, my mother doesn't want such a SSD, but she previously said "I wish I could have had my laptop.."<br/><br/>Therefore, I decided to compose a laptop using my old PC components and the SSD.<br/><br/>I'm sure she likes this laptop! :D
