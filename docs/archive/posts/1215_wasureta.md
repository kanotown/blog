# 【No. 1215】<strong><em>Wasureta</em></strong> (忘れた - I Forgot)
<div class="date">Apr 16, 2018 10:36</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Wasureta</em></strong><br/><br/>I decided on today's topic ahead of time, but I completely forgot what I was going to write.<br/><br/>Instead, I would like to talk about the kanji "忘" of "wasureru" (忘れる), which means to forget something.<br/>(Note that "忘" is read as "bou" in the Chinese reading, whereas it is read as "wasu-reru" in the Japanese reading.)<br/><br/>The kanji "忘" can be divided into two different kanji: "亡" and "心."<br/><br/>"亡" comes from a hieroglyphic that represents "a dead body whose limbs are bent," and it means that something is lost or someone dies.<br/><br/>"心" comes from a hieroglyphic that represents "heart," and it means consciousness, mind, true feelings, etc.<br/><br/>That is to say, the combination "忘" means that one's memory is lost from the mind.

忘れた<br/><br/>私は今日、あるトピックについて書こうと考えていましたが、何を書こうとしていたのか忘れてしまいました。<br/><br/>代わりに、"forget" を意味する日本語「忘れる」の、「忘」という漢字について書きます。<br/><br/>「忘」は、「亡」と「心」の二つに分けることができます。<br/><br/>「亡」は「手足を曲げている死体」の象形文字から来ており、何かがなくなったり、人が死ぬことを意味します。<br/><br/>「心」は「心臓」の象形文字から来ており、意識や精神、本心などを意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち「忘」とは、心の中から記憶が失われるということです。
