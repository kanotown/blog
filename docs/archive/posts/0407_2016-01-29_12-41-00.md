朝日の効果<br/><br/>最近寒くなり、朝起きるのが辛いという人も多いかと思います。<br/><br/>今日はそんな人におすすめされている、「朝日を浴びる習慣」を見つけました。<br/><br/>人間は通常、生活の周期と体内時計の間にはずれが生じます。<br/><br/>しかし朝日を浴びることで体内時計がリセットされ、生活周期とのずれを修正することができるそうです。<br/><br/>朝日を浴びる理想的な時間は、起床後2時間以内に20～30分程度だそうです。<br/><br/>起きたらなんとか窓のそばに行き、カーテンを開けてしばらく過ごせば、その日一日元気に過ごすことができます。<br/><br/>具体的には2000ルクス以上の光であればいいようですが、室内の照明はおおよそ1000ルクス程度です（コンビニであれば約2500ルクス）。<br/><br/>一方、晴れの日は50000ルクス、曇りの日は10000ルクス、雨の日は5000ルクス程度だそうなので、とにかく外の光を浴びるのが一番効率が良いです。
