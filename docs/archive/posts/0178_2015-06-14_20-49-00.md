<h1 id="subject_show">Apple Wireless Keyboard</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Jun 14, 2015 20:49</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I bought an Apple wireless keyboard (US) on the net auction.<br/><br/>The reason why I bought the US version keyboard is that just it looks cool.<br/><br/>In most of the Japanese keyboard, hiragana are printed, though we rarely use hiragana input system.<br/><br/>We mainly use romaji input system, so there is no need to be printed hiragana on keyboards.<br/><br/>Above all, keyboards that hiragana are printed don't look cool.<br/><br/>Now, I'm satisfied.

 I'm certainly with you on that. English-only keyboards looks so clean compared to bilingual ones.

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/>Yeah, I think bilingual keyboards don't fit to mac's design concept.
