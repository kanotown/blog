# Honey Trivia
<div class="date">Dec 11, 2015 15:28</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I wrote about bees' dance yesterday, but I will write about honey today.<br/><br/>Honey, which is produced by mixing nectar and bees' enzyme, is known as a food that will never rot.<br/><br/>The reason is because the sugar concentration is high and the water content is low.<br/><br/>When the sugar concentration is high, bacteria can't survive.<br/><br/>When the water content is low, fungus can't reproduce.<br/><br/>In fact, Dr. Davis found a 3300-year-old honey jar from an Egyptian tomb, but the quality hasn't deteriorated.<br/><br/>By the way, the honey amount that a bee can collect using its whole lifetime is around 5 grams(a spoonful of honey).<br/>

蜂蜜の雑学<br/><br/>昨日はミツバチのダンスについて書きましたが、今日は蜂蜜の雑学について書こうと思います。<br/><br/>ミツバチが花の蜜と自身の酵素を混ぜることで生成される蜂蜜は、唯一の腐らない食料として知られています。<br/><br/>その理由は、糖濃度が高いことと、水分が少ないことに起因します。<br/><br/>糖濃度が高いとバクテリアは生存できず、水分が少ないとカビは繁殖できません。<br/><br/>実際、T.M.デービス博士がエジプトの墳墓から約3300年前の蜂蜜瓶を発見しましたが、品質は劣化していなかったそうです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、一匹のミツバチがが一生かけて集める蜂蜜の量は、5グラム（スプーン一杯）程度だそうです。

 It's interesting that, even though it never goes bad, honey still has an expiration date when it's sold in supermarkets.

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/>Haha, yes indeed. In Japan, to display the expiration date is obliged by law, and the period is usually 2-3 years. It is said that the honey flavor will be degraded gradually during the period.
