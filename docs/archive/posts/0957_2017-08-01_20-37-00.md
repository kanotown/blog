# 【No. 0957】<strong><em>Yodare</strong></em> (よだれ - Saliva)
<div class="date">Aug 1, 2017 20:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I found a student who was sleeping while dribbling "yodare" (よだれ).<br/><br/>"Yodare" means saliva dribbling unconsciously from a mouth.<br/><br/>This term was called "yodari" (よだり) or "yotari" (よたり) until the Heian period.<br/><br/>Here, "tari" is a noun form of the verb "taru" (垂る), which means to dribble.<br/><br/>There are several theories about the etymology of "yo" -- one of them is that it comes from "yoyomu," which means to become an old person.<br/><br/>Incidentally, if you say "yodare wo tarasu" (よだれを垂らす - dribbling yodare), it could literally mean to dribble saliva, but it also used as a phrase that means to have a hunger to eat/do something.

よだれ<br/><br/>今日は、よだれを垂らして寝ている学生を見ました。<br/><br/>よだれとは、口から無意識に流れ出る唾液のことを意味します。<br/><br/>この言葉は平安時代までは、「よだり」や「よたり」と言われていました。<br/><br/>ここで「たり」は、動詞「垂る」の名詞形です。<br/><br/>「よ」は、年老いてよぼよぼになるという意味の「よよむ」から来ているという説がありますが、詳しくはわかっていません。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「よだれを垂らす」と言うと、文字どおり「唾液を垂らす」ことも意味することがありますが、「食べたくてたまらないこと」や「欲しくてたまらない」ことを表す慣用句としても使われます。
