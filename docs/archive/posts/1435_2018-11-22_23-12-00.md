<h1 id="subject_show">Usankusai (胡散臭い - Doubtful)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Nov 22, 2018 23:12</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Usankusai<br/><br/>Yesterday, I introduced you to the Japanese term 'kinakusai' (きな臭い), which means that something is suspicious.<br/><br/>There is another term 'usankusai' (胡散臭い), which has a similar meaning to 'kinakusai'.<br/><br/>'Usan' (胡散) means that something is suspicious, and 'kusai' (臭い) is a prefix that has the meaning of "seem like" and a negative nuance.<br/><br/>As I mentioned yesterday, 'kinakusai' implies that something bad (such as a fire) is about to occur.<br/><br/>On the other hand, 'usankusai' is often used to mean that something seems like somewhat suspicious/doubtful.

胡散臭い<br/><br/>昨日は何かが疑わしいことを意味する「きな臭い」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>「きな臭い」とよく似た言葉に「胡散臭い」があります。<br/><br/>「胡散」は何かが怪しいことを意味する言葉で、「臭い」は「～らしい」の意味（特にマイナスのイメージ）を持つ接尾辞です。<br/><br/>「きな臭い」は昨日話したとおり、火事など何か悪い出来事が起こりそうなことを暗に意味します。<br/><br/>一方で「胡散臭い」は、何かが「何となく疑わしい」程度のことを意味する際によく使われます。
