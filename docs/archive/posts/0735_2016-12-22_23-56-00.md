MacBook Pro を購入<br/><br/>昨夜、MacBook Pro が届きました。<br/><br/>とても楽しみにしていたので、かなり興奮していました。<br/><br/>しかし、早速開封して設定していると、ある異変に気が付きました。<br/><br/>キーボードの「A」を押したときだけ、他のキーと少し感触が違い、そして少し大きいカチカチ音がするのです。<br/><br/>文章を打っているときのタイピングの音を聞いていると、どこでAを押したのががよくわかります。<br/><br/>著しく大きい音ではありませんが、Aのキーはとてもよく押すので、かなり気になります。<br/><br/>我慢しようか交換依頼しようか悩んでいます。<br/><br/>嬉しかった気持ちが一気に沈みました。

 If it's that noticeable and distracting, I think you should try taking it to an Apple store and asking about it. If there's not one near you, then I think you should consider asking for an exchange. The 'A' key might have been incorrectly installed.

 Since Apple has a generally good return policy, I suggest you should return it asap.

 Don't feel depressed! I'm sure Apple can fix it if you bring it for repair. And I don't own any Apple device, but I heard their service is very good :-)
