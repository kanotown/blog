# 【No. 1179】<strong><em>Bureikou</strong></em> (無礼講 - Unrestricted Binge)
<div class="date">Mar 11, 2018 16:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There is a drinking party called 無礼講 (bureikou) in Japan.<br/><br/>無 (bu) means "nothing" and 礼講 "reikou" means a kind of ritual that respects courtesies and protocols.<br/><br/>The combination, "bureikou," meant a drinking party that was held after "reikou," and it has become a famous term meaning a drinking party that people don't care the difference in status, courtesy or protocols.<br/><br/>Since "bureikou" can be divided into 無礼 (burei - rudeness) and 講 (kou - not care), so some people think that "bureikou" means a drinking party that people can be rude to their boss.<br/><br/>However, of course this thought is wrong.

無礼講<br/><br/>日本で行われる宴会には、「無礼講」と呼ばれるものがあります。<br/><br/>「礼講」は「身分をはっきとして、儀礼や手順を重んじる儀式」のことを指します。<br/><br/>そして「無礼講」は「礼講」の二次会的に行われる宴会のことで、「身分や儀礼を取り払った気楽な宴会」を意味する言葉として広まりました。<br/><br/>「無礼講」は「無礼」と「構」に分けることができることから、「上司に無礼を働いても構わない宴会」と勘違いする人がいますが、間違っているので注意して下さい。
