<h1 id="subject_show">Sneaked into a Class</h1>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
This morning, I tried to sneak into a class of master's course, and was exposed immediately because there were few students.<br/><br/>However, the teacher welcomed me with good cheer. Yes!<br/><br/>The teacher teach statistics using Python, and I wanted to learn how to use Python for statistics analysis.<br/><br/>In the class, the teacher spoke only English, so sometimes I could not understand his words.<br/><br/>However, I could get a sense of Python programming, and it was so exciting.<br/><br/>And now, I have a homework until next week.<br/><br/>Homework...it's been a really long time.<br/><br/>I'm excited!
