Today, I will talk about the Japanese formula in letters, "ご自愛ください (gojiai kudasai)." <br/><br/>The literal meaning is "please love yourself," and it's used as the meaning of "take care of yourself" or "I hope your health is good."<br/><br/>This expression is thought of as beautiful, and is often appended at the end of letters.<br/><br/>If you type "gojiai" and convert it into kanji, it may become "ご慈愛."<br/><br/>However, since the meaning is quite different from "ご自愛," please be careful to convert it.<br/><br/>If you say "ご慈愛ください (gojiai kudasai)," it means something like "please give me your deep love."<br/>(This phrase is sometimes used for God or Buddha.)

ご自愛ください<br/><br/>今日は、日本の手紙における常套句である「ご自愛ください」を紹介します。<br/><br/>文字通りの意味は、「自分自身を愛してください」であり、それが転じて「自身を大切にして下さい」「お体に気をつけて下さい」のような意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>この表現は美しいとされることが多く、我々はよく手紙の最後に「ご自愛ください」と付け足します。<br/><br/>「ごじあい」で変換すると「ご慈愛」という漢字も出てきますが、意味が大きく異るので注意して下さい。<br/><br/>「ご慈愛ください」と言うと、「私にあなたの深い愛情をください」というような意味になります。<br/>（神や仏に対して使われます。）
