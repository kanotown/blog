サンキューハザード<br/><br/>今日は日本の道路でよく使われる、サンキューハザードを紹介します。<br/><br/>サンキューハザードとは、車で運転中に道を譲ってくれた相手に「ありがとう」を伝えるため、ハザードランプを2回ほどチカチカさせることです。<br/><br/>明るくて相手の顔が見えるような状況では、「手を挙げる」「お辞儀をする」などで感謝の気持ちを伝えます。<br/><br/>しかし、暗くなっている場合はサンキューハザードがよく使われます。<br/><br/>サンキューハザードをされると、少しうれしい気持ちになります。<br/><br/>稀にクランションを鳴らして「ありがとう」を伝える人もいますが、これは違法の上、驚くからやめてほしいです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、この風習はかつてドイツのトラック仲間で行われていたもので、それが日本に伝わって一般化したと言われています。

I am sorry for not being more clear. We do not use the phrase "thank you hazard", just the practice. I don't think we have a name for it but I personally call it "courtesy flash"

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/>I'm also not sure whether or not "thank you hazard" is appropriate.<br/>The reason why we often say "Thank you hazard（サンキューハザード）" is because both "thank you(サンキュー)" and "hazard(ハザード)" are very common words in Japan. Therefore, for English speakers, other expressions like "Hazard light for thank you" or "Hazards to say thanks" might sound more natural (I found these phrases on the Internet).

I see! Of the two I think "Hazards to say thanks" sounds more natural. :)
