# 【No. 0189】Greenland and Iceland
<div class="date">Jun 25, 2015 14:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned about etymologies of Greenland and Iceland.<br/><br/>Both of them were named by Erik the Red in the 10th century.<br/><br/>Firstly, he gave an island the name Iceland, and tried to marshal residents.<br/><br/>However, he couldn't gather a lot of people because of the island's name.<br/><br/>Next, he gave an island the name of Greenland from his failure, though there were almost no green in the island.<br/><br/>In other words, he lied.<br/><br/>Resultingly, he couldn't gather a lot of people to the island as well.<br/><br/>Iceland has a lot of green, and Greenland has a lot of ice.<br/><br/>These are so beautiful, so I want to go there someday.
