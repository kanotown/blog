# <strong><em>IIdashippe</strong></em> (言い出しっぺ - The First One to Say Something)
<div class="date">Mar 10, 2018 15:56</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A person who says something firstly is called 言い出しっぺ (iidashippe) in Japanese.<br/><br/>言い出し (iidashi) means "to start saying something" or "to bring something up," and ペ (pe) means "fart." <br/><br/>This term comes from the rule of thumb that a person who says "it stinks" firstly must be the one who farted. <br/><br/>Because of this, "iidashippe" is often used when someone insists that a person who brought something up firstly should take on the responsibility.<br/><br/>This thought is sometimes referred to as 言い出しっぺの法則 (iidashippe no housoku - the rule of iidashippe).

言い出しっぺ<br/><br/>何かを最初に言い出した人のことを、日本語で「言い出しっぺ」と言います。<br/><br/>「言い出し」は "to start saying," 「ぺ」は「屁」すなわち  "fart" を意味します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、「最初に臭い（すなわち誰かが放屁した）と言い出した人こそ、犯人であるに違いない」という経験則から生まれました。<br/><br/>このことから「言い出しっぺ」は、何か言い出した人が責任を負うべきだと主張する際によく使われます。<br/><br/>特にこの理念のことを「言い出しっぺの法則」ということもあります。

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>例えば、次のように使うことができます。<br/>「言い出しっぺの君が、まずやるべきだ。」 (You should do it first, because you're the one who brought it up.)

 It's amazing how despite different cultures, people seem to generally share the same way of thinking in certain situations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As someone else said, in English, there's an expression ("He who smelt it, dealt it") for suggesting that the person who makes the first comment about a fart is the one who did it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Funny.

Thank you for the comment!<br/>Yes, it's quite interesting that there are similar thinking and proverbs among different countries/cultures.

Because of this, "iidashippe" is often used when someone insists that a person who brought something up first should take on the responsibility. &lt;&lt;This is more natural
