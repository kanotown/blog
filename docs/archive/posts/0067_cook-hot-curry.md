# 【No. 0067】Cook Hot Curry
<div class="date">Feb 23, 2015 22:56</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Yesterday, I cooked hot curry for my dinner. Since I used an expensive Japanese Black Wagyu, it became delicious. However, I cooked the curry too much (I made 6 servings), so today's my breakfast and lunch and dinner were also the curry. I think a few percent of now my body is composed of the curry. I'm worried whether my body is giving off a curry smell.
