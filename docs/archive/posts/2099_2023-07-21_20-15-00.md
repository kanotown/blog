<strong><em>Shoshin Wasuru Bekarazu</strong></em>: Part 1<br/><br/>Today, I would like to introduce one of my favorite proverbs, <strong><em>shoshin wasuru bekarazu</em></strong> (初心忘るべからず).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>sho</em></strong> (初) means "first," <strong><em>shin</em></strong> (心) means "heart," and the combination <strong><em>shoshin</em></strong> (初心) means "the mind when one first begins to learn something."<br/><br/>In addition, <strong><em>wasuru/wasureru</em></strong> (忘る/忘れる) means "to forget," and <strong><em>bekarazu</em></strong> (べからず) means "to forbid something," the literal meaning of this proverb is "Do not forget to the mind when one first begins to learn something."<br/><br/>In other words, the important thing when learning something is to never forget the humble and serious attitude you had when you began to learn.

初心忘るべからず Part 1<br/><br/>今日は私の好きなことわざの一つ、「初心忘るべからず」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「初」は "first"、「心」は "heart/mind" を意味し、「初心」で「物事の習い始め」やそのときの気持ちという意味になります。<br/><br/>また、「忘る/忘れる」は "to forget"、「べからず」は禁止を意味するので、このことわざの文字どおりの意味は "Do not forget to the mind when one first begins to learn something" となります。<br/><br/>物事を学び続けるうえで重要なことは、始めた頃の謙虚で真剣な気持ちを忘れないことである、というわけです。
