# 【No. 0074】Massive Power Outage
<div class="date">Mar 2, 2015 22:23</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Early in the morning, a massive power outage was occurred in my prefecture. This power outage cut electricity to about 380 thousand homes and stopped about 2700 traffic lights. Furthermore, 15 bullet trains stopped and this influenced about 6600 people. It was reported that the reason of the power outage was that transmission lines had been damaged, and it lasted from 5:30 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. However, actually I couldn't be aware of this power outage, because I woke up around 8:30 a.m. and I didn't use electricity for a while. I just noticed the power outage when I went to my university and watched my PC. Although I put my PC in sleep mode, it was shut down.<br/><br/>　Anyway, this accident was lucky it wasn't worse. I mean, despite the massive power outage, there were no large-scale traffic accidents or injuries.

<p class="correction_comment">A more conversational way to say "transmission lines" is "power cables." But if your intention is not to be casual, "transmission lines" is totally fine!</p>

Although I <span class="f_blue">had</span> put my PC in sleep mode, it was shut down <span class="f_blue">(when I checked it today)</span>.
<p class="correction_comment">"had put" uses an English construction called the "past perfect" tense. Basically, this tense is used when you are talking about something that happened even earlier than what you re discussing using the past tense.<br/><br/>In this case, you had put your PC to sleep a day before you came in today to check it. So to put that little logical space between your action today and your action yesterday, you can use the "past perfect" (had put) to express your action yesterday and the "simple past" to express your action today (checked).<br/><br/>I hope this is not too confusing!</p>

Thank you so much for correcting me!<br/>I really appreciate your kind and helpful comments. :D<br/><br/>There is no tense which corresponds to "past perfect" or "present perfect" in Japanese, so I often mistake these tenses. But from now, I'll be more careful!

This is incorrect -- if you want to use "of" in this sentence, then: "this power outage cut THE electricity of about 380 thousand homes..." is how you would phrase it. But the way you originally had it is better. brburzon's other corrections are good.
