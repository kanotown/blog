あくびの科学<br/><br/>昨日は「あくび」という言葉について紹介しました。<br/><br/>実は、あくびが発生するメカニズムは、まだ解明されていません。<br/><br/>ニューヨーク州立大学オルバニー校のゴードンらは、あくびは脳の温度調節（脳の冷却）のために行われている可能性を示唆しています。<br/><br/>また、あくびは種を超えて伝染することが知られていますが、この原因もわかっていません。<br/><br/>スターリング大学のアンダーソンらは、眠る時間を互いに知らせるシグナルである説を提唱しています。<br/><br/>ちなみに、あくびの回数が異常に多い場合は、病気の可能性があるので注意して下さい。

Actually, no one has yet <span class="f_bold">explained </span>the mechanism of yawning.
<p class="correction_comment">'Elucidate', in addition to sounding a bit wordy, lacks the nuance of 'discovered' that just plain old 'explained' has here. <br/><br/>'No one has yet elucidated' to me sounds like someone knows already, they're just choosing not to tell us, rather than no one truly knows.</p>

 I'd never really thought that much about yawning, to be honest. Interesting!
