<h1 id="subject_show">Interesting Open and Closed Signs Board</h1>
<div class="date">Aug 18, 2015 11:19</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I found an interesting open/closed signs board.<br/><br/>The video is shown below.<br/><br/><object height="315" width="560">
<param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/OKWyqc0aWoQ"/>
<embed height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/OKWyqc0aWoQ" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560"/>
</object>
<br/><br/>As you can see, the word "close" changed into the word "open" by rotating the gears.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the character <em>d</em> changed to the eighth note, and the star changed to the sun.<br/><br/>It was so impressive to me, and I liked this gimmick.

Furthermore, the <span class="f_blue">character</span> 'd' changed to the eighth note, and the star changed to the sun.

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>Oh, although I was told same thing before, I've forgot it. Maybe I tend to say "character" and "string" subconsciously, because I'm a programmer.
