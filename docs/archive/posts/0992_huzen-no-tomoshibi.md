# 【No. 0992】<strong><em>Hūzen no Tomoshibi</em></strong> (風前の灯火 - Hang by A Thread)
<div class="date">Sep 5, 2017 10:30</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
If you want to say that a thing or a person is in danger, or it is about to disappear, you can use the phrase, "hūzen no yomoshibi" (風前の灯火) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "hūzen" (風前) means "front of wind," that is to say, "a windy place."<br/><br/>The "tomoshibi" (灯火) means a light with fire, such as a flaring candle, in a literal sense.<br/><br/>If there is a flaring candle in a windy place, obviously the fire will be about to go out, so this phrase has come to have the current meaning.<br/><br/>It seems to be similar to the English phrase, "hang by a thread."

風前の灯火<br/><br/>物事や人が危険にされているときや、今にも消えてしまいそうな危ない状態のことを、日本語で「風前の灯火」と言います。<br/><br/>「風前」は風の前、すなわち風のあたる場所を意味します。<br/><br/>「灯火」は、文字どおり火を灯した明かりを意味します。<br/><br/>風のあたる場所に灯火があると、今にも消えてしまいそうなことから、現在の意味で使われるようになりました。<br/><br/>英語では "hang by a thread" （一本の糸で吊るす）などのように言えるようです。
