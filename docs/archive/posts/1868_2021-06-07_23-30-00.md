<strong><em>Ushirogami wo Hikareru</strong></em><br/><br/>When you are unable to move on due to regrets, it can be described as <strong><em>ushirogami wo hikareru</em></strong> (後ろ髪を引かれる) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>ushiro</em></strong> (後ろ) means "back/behind," <strong><em>kami/gami</em></strong> (髪) means "hair," and <strong><em>hikareru</em></strong> (引かれる) means "pulled (by someone)," the literal meaning of <em>ushirogami wo hikareru</em> is "the hair on the back of one's head is pulled by someone."<br/><br/>This expression was coined as the feeling of regrets is similar to the sense of having the hair on the back of one's head pulled from behind.<br/><br/>In the past, many Japanese men wore their hair long (especially on the back of the head) to tie a topknot, which may have led to the creation of this expression.

後ろ髪を引かれる<br/><br/>未練や心残りがあり、先へ進むことができないことを、「後ろ髪を引かれる」といいます。<br/><br/>「後ろ」は "back/behind"、「髪」は "hair"、「引かれる」は "pulled (by someone)" を意味するので、「後ろ髪を引かれる」の文字どおりの意味は "the hair on the back of one's head is pulled by someone" となります。<br/><br/>未練や心残りがある心境が、後頭部に生えている髪の毛を後ろから引っ張られるような感覚であることから、この表現が作られました。<br/><br/>かつて日本では、髷のために後ろ髪を長くしていた男性も多かったので、このような表現が生まれたのかもしれません。

<li class="incorrect">Since 'ushiro' (後ろ) means "back/behind," 'kami/gami' (髪) means "hair," and 'hikareru' (引かれる) means "pulled (by someone)," the literal meaning of 'ushirogami wo hikareru' is "the hair on the back of one's head is pulled by someone."</li>
