# 【No. 0184】XYZPDQ
<div class="date">Jun 20, 2015 12:12</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned a slang 'xyzpdq.'<br/><br/>This means "examine your zipper, pretty damn quick."<br/><br/><em>Xyz</em> can also be paraphrased something like "your fly is open."<br/><br/>I think I must remind myself to examine my zipper frequently.<br/><br/>By the way, when we want to say <em>xyz</em> in Japan, we often say "window of society is open(社会の窓が開いているよ)."<br/><br/>This phrase implies "the important thing is hidden in the window of society."

 I've never heard of that before. Where did you hear it?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I'll mostly hear the phrase "you're flying low" to mean something similar.
