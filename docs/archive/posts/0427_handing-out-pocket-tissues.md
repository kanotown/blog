ポケットティッシュ配り<br/><br/>今日は日本の文化の一つと言われている、ティッシュ配りを紹介します。<br/><br/>日本の街中では、毎日大量のポケットティッシュが無料で配られています。<br/><br/>ポケットティッシュにはチラシが含まれていますが、それ以外は普通のティッシュです。<br/><br/>都会では1日10個のポケットティッシュをもらうことも難しくはありません。<br/><br/>台湾やドイツなどでもポケットティッシュは配られているようですが、世界的には珍しいようです。

Thank you very much always for correcting my post! :)<br/>I think it's not related to the hay fever season very much. Pocket tissues seem to be handed out constantly through a whole year in the same way.
