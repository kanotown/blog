# 【No. 1087】<strong><em>Dotanba</strong></em> (土壇場 - Critical Moment)
<div class="date">Dec 9, 2017 16:12</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I don't like a situation called "dotanba" (土壇場) very much.<br/><br/>"Dotanba" means a critical moment or the last moment that you're required a decision.<br/><br/>The "do" (土) means "earthen," the "tan" (壇) means "platform," the "ba" (場) means "place," so the literal meaning of "dotanba" is "an earthen platform place."<br/><br/>Before the Edo period, "dotanba" was used in the literal meaning.<br/><br/>However, in the Edo period, criminals were made lie down on "dotanba" and were executed, so it has come to mean an execution place, and changed to the current meaning.

土壇場<br/><br/>私は「土壇場」があまり好きではありません。<br/><br/>「土壇場」は、切羽詰まった場面や、決断をせまられる最後の局面を意味します。<br/><br/>「土」は "earthen," 「壇」は "platform," 「場」は "place" を意味するので、「土壇場」の文字どおりの意味は "earthen platform place" のようになります。<br/><br/>江戸時代に入る前まで、「土壇場」は文字どおりの意味で使われていました。<br/><br/>しかし江戸時代に入ってからは、犯罪者を土壇場に横たわらせて首を斬っていたことから、「土壇場」は「刑場」を意味するようになり、現在の意味を持つようになりました。
