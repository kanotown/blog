# 【No. 0336】Knot Theory
<div class="date">Nov 19, 2015 14:20</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Have you ever experienced that your earphone code imperceptibly made a knot?<br/><br/>In knot theory, it is mentioned that a string that was put in a container would be knotted with a high probability if the string had a enough length.<br/><br/>However, I feel that it become extremely high probability in the case of earphone codes.<br/><br/>As the reasons, it have been thought like the following:<br/><br/>・When the winding direction and the unwinding direction were different, the cord would become kinked and entangled.<br/><br/>・Since the earphone part is heavier than the cord part, it easy to flounce and tangle.

結び目理論<br/><br/>イヤホンのコードがいつの間にか結び目をつくっていたことはありませんか？<br/><br/>結び目理論では、容器の中に十分長いひもが入っていると、ひもが結ばれる確率が高くなることに言及しています。<br/><br/>ただ、イヤホンの場合は異常に結び目ができる確率が非常に高く感じます。<br/><br/>その理由として、以下のようなものが考えられています。<br/><br/>イヤホンのコードを巻く方向とほどく方向が異なるとき、ねじれが生じて絡まりやすくなるそうです。<br/><br/>また、イヤホン部はコード部と比べて重いため、それが暴れて絡まりやすいそうです。

 Interesting! It seems that there is a theory for everything that happens in our world))

Thank you very much always for correcting my post!<br/>&gt; It seems that there is a theory for everything that happens in our world))<br/>I think you can say that again. :)
