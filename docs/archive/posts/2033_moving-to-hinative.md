HiNative への移動を検討<br/><br/>6年以上前から、Lang-8 はユーザの新規登録を停止しています。<br/><br/>同時期に HiNative という姉妹サービスが登場し、そちらへの誘導も行われましたが、長文の投稿や Lang-8 のような添削機能が無かったので、私はここに留まりました。<br/><br/>しかし先日、私のエッセイを読んでくれていた友人から「読めなくなった」と連絡がありました。<br/><br/>Lang-8 は、記事の公開範囲を「全体」にすると、アカウントを持たないユーザでも閲覧できるようになっていたのですが、それすらも不可になってしまったようです。<br/><br/>新規登録が停止し、更新もされず、人が減り、どんどん悪くなっていくように感じます。<br/><br/>一方で HiNative のほうは、多少の課金が必要ではありそうでしたが、長文の日記投稿や添削も可能になったようでした。<br/><br/>今後、HiNative に移動してエッセイを投稿していくことを考えています。<br/><br/>以下は私の HiNative のプロフィールページです。<br/><br/><a href="https://ja.hinative.com/profiles/20278" target="_blank">https://ja.hinative.com/profiles/20278</a>

 I use Hi-Native too, but there are some issues, namely:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 1. It's difficult to explain the reason for a correction like on lang-8 since there is no 添削への説明 option.
 <br/>
 2. (In my case) You get fewer corrections and interactions. Once one person comments the less likely more people are to look at your post.
 <br/>
 3. There is no social component like on lang-8, where you can build a report with your friends. (While a friend feature does exist on hi-native, it is not as effective as lang-8's)
 <br/>
 4. It's difficult to gauge a corrector's credibility. I've personally seen many people with terrible English skills who falsely claim to be "native speakers" and give wrong corrections to English learners.

Thank you so much for the correction and comments!<br/><br/>Indeed, there are still various problems with HiNative. The difficulty in explaining each sentence could be a significant problem. Also, when using HiNative for a few days, I found many Japanese people making wrong/rough corrections, which was slightly disappointing.<br/><br/>Hmmm, I might consider creating my own Lang-8 alternative website...

 It could be a temporary bug because I'm still able to see your posts and posts by other members.
