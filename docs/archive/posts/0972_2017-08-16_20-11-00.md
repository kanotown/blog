<h1 id="subject_show">Family Trip in Summer</h1>
<div class="date">Aug 16, 2017 20:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
From yesterday to today, my relatives, my family and I have gone to a trip.<br/><br/>Although it was tough to treat my nephew and my niece on the car, it was also fun. <br/><br/>The hotel was located between the mountain and the sea, and the hot spring was in the cave.<br/><br/>Since you could see the expanse sea from the hot spring in the cave, we could totally feel the enormous nature.<br/><br/>However, somehow I couldn't sleep well yesterday (probably it was due to the unfamiliar environment.).<br/><br/>Today we went to LEGOLAND Japan, played there, and came back to home.<br/><br/>I'm quite exhausted now.

夏の家族旅行<br/><br/>昨日から今日にかけて、私は親戚一同で旅行に来ています。<br/><br/>車の中で甥っ子と姪っ子の対応をするのは大変でしたが、楽しかったです。<br/><br/>ホテルは海と山に挟まれており、温泉は洞窟の中にありました。<br/><br/>洞窟の中の温泉からは海が一望でき、自然をとても近くに感じることができました。<br/><br/>ただ、昨日はどういうわけかあまり眠れませんでした。<br/><br/>今日は家に帰る途中、レゴランドに寄って遊びましたが、もうクタクタです。

 It's always good to have such trips once in a while.
