帰国<br/><br/>今日は、午前中にルーベンにある世界遺産のベギンホフを見に行きました。<br/><br/>とても素敵な景観で、幸せな気分になりました。<br/><br/>その後は、少し街で買い物をして、空港に向けて電車に乗りました。<br/><br/>しかし、乗る電車に間違えてしまい、1時間程余計にかかってしまいました。<br/><br/>念を入れてだいぶ早めに行動していたおかげでなんとかなりました。<br/><br/>ブリュッセル国際空港の免税店で、更にチョコレートの買い物をして、まずはドバイに向けてフライトです。<br/><br/>ドバイの空港では、またチョコを買ってしまいました。
