授賞式<br/><br/>今日は茨城県つくば市で学会の授賞式があり、私は論文賞を受賞しました。<br/><br/>そして、授賞式の後には受賞を記念して、基調講演を行いました。<br/><br/>今回は1人での寂しい遠征と講演だと思っていましたが、講演中に私の学生時代の恩師が写真を撮っているのに気が付きました。<br/><br/>かなり驚いて少し動揺しましたが、とても嬉しかったです。<br/><br/>さらに、その後のバンケットでは多くの教授方や運営の方に、私のことを紹介してくれました。<br/><br/>とても充実した一日でした。<br/><br/>今後とも仲良くさせて頂きたい思いです。

<p class="correction_comment">If there's only one, then "the" should be used instead of "a".  However, if there are many best-paper awards, using "a" is correct.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">There was nothing wrong with the original "win", but using "award" is a little more humble.  This is only style, not real correction.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">Because you thought it was lonely, but actually, it was different, I changed the wording to subjunctive "would be". <br/><br/>I put a note that "a former teacher" could be appropriate as you probably have had many former teachers. "My former teacher" is not wrong, could be seen as dismissive of other former teachers. <br/><br/>Also, I changed "when I was talking" to "during my speech".  Again, original was not wrong, but this style sounds a bit more formal, which matches the rest of your post.</p>

I was very surprised and a little unsettled, but <span class="f_red">(in the end) </span>I was really pleased<span class="f_red"> (to meet him/that he came)</span>.
<p class="correction_comment">Nothing grammatically wrong, but the original sentence sounds a little short. Possible additions are in ().</p>

<li class="corrected correct">
In addition, he introduced me to many <span class="f_red">of </span>his friends, professors and officers at the banquet.
<p class="correction_comment">When using possessive pronoun like "his", you need to use "many of" instead of "many".</p>
