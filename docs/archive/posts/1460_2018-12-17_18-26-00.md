海の藻屑<br/><br/>海難事故で死んでしまうことを、日本語で「海の藻屑になる」と言います。<br/><br/>「海」は "sea"、「藻屑」は "scrap alga"、「になる」は "to become" を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち、「海の藻屑になる」の文字どおりの意味は "to become scrap algae" となります。<br/><br/>ちなみに、日本語には "nemacystus decipiens" を意味する「モズク」という言葉があります。<br/><br/>「モズク」は海藻であり、かつ「藻屑」と発音がよく似ているため、「海の藻屑」を「海のモズク」と言い間違える人もいます。
