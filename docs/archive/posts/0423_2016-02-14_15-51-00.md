日本人の労働時間<br/><br/>たまに、インターネット上で日本人は長時間働くという意見を耳にします。<br/><br/>以前の日本では、「月月火水木金金」や「24時間戦えますか」というキャッチフレーズがよくCMで流れており、沢山働いている印象がありました。<br/><br/>しかし日本人は働き過ぎなのではなく、ただ時間をかけているだけだとも言われていました。<br/><br/>これを解決するため、近年では休二日制を導入したり、祝日の数を増やしたりしています。<br/><br/>現在日本の祝日の数は16日で、その多さは世界で第三位です。<br/><br/>しかし、私はサービス残業と有休取得率の問題が残っていると思います。<br/><br/>残念なことに、多くの企業が労働基準法を満たしていないと考えられています。

 Hmm 16 National holidays is a lot! Singapore is known for the smallest number of national holidays in the world :(

Thank you so much always for correcting my post! :)<br/>Oh, that's unfortunate. However, many people have a longing for working in Singapore.
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Yukinekorin</span><br>
You are welcome!! ^^<br/>Yup, many people long to study in Singapore as well. But I feel that the working environment in Singapore is a little like Japan's, based on the number of working hours a week. But services in Japan are definitely better than Singapore's hahaha.
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
Yes, I also would like to study in Singapore :) <br/>Also, people were very kind, though my English was bad, haha. Furthermore, fruits juice was very inexpensive and really delicious! I was impressed. Ah, I'm thirsty.
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Yukinekorin</span><br>
Haha to be honest though, although I love my own country, the people in Japan are much more polite and friendly in my opinion. Singapore allows foreigners to stay here, hence we have a lot of people of different cultures and nations staying here. As such, there are clashes of opinions and cultural differences, and some of the Chinese (my own race) isn't as polite as I am taught to be. <br/><br/>I thought we would be more famous for our food though hahaha! I didn't expect it to be fruit juice xD
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
I see, thank you for letting me know!<br/>I sometimes think that all people are kind, but it might be danger, haha.<br/><br/>&gt; I thought we would be more famous for our food though hahaha! I didn't expect it to be fruit juice xD<br/>Haha, yes, I also ate many other famous and delicious food :) However, if I want to drink fresh fruit juice in Japan, I have to pay 600-800 yen (7-10 Singapore dollars) !
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Yukinekorin</span><br>
Haha I guess so! We won't know what they are really thinking.<br/><br/>That's really expensive for fruit juice! :O no wonder it struck you as one of the more memorable  things in Singapore hahaha ^^

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; I'm not sure what the first phrase is used for, can you explain<br/>"Monday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Friday" means that there are no Sunday and Saturday. This implies a 7-day work week.

<p class="comment_small">
 Yeah, it's a little upsetting to see, especially since I now have work experience in both Canada and Japan. Two things I think you might find interesting:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 1. Japanese corporate culture seems to prefer the *image* of being hard-working, than an actually efficient employee. Rather than rewarding employees for finishing their work efficiently and quickly (by allowing them to go home earlier), they prefer to punish that behavior by expecting all employees stay later. This encourages Japanese workers to be inefficient, and wasteful.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 2. Studies (Stanford Univ.) have shown that work-place productivity drops off sharply after about 55 hours in a work week. Meaning that if you work 70 hours a week, then you're wasting 15 hours of your life, and potentially causing mistakes for the company as well (which can be even more expensive to rectify). source:

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; how recently?<br/>The 5-day work week system has been gradually introduced from around 1990, and in 2002, finally most companies and schools introduced it. Also, a national holiday called "山の日 (mountain day)" was enacted in 2016.<br/><br/>Also, thank you for sharing the interesting and helpful information :)<br/>As you say, I think workings in many Japanese companies are inefficient. And the studies are really interesting. I will show them to my friend, who works over 80 hours a week.

 "seem to" implies subjectivity, while "meeting the Labour Standards Act" is not really a subjective issue (either they do, or they don't). To preserve the sense of subjectivity I suggest changing "meet" to "respect".

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; Do you mean that vacations are not given as standard, or that vacations days supposedly promised are not actually realised?<br/>Although vacations with pay are given, most of us don't use all of them. There are several reasons, such as pressures from their bosses, a guilt, and a sense of responsibility.
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">gwaice</span><br>
Then maybe a good correction could be "and a tendency to forgo vacation days."
