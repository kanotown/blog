# 【No. 0219】Beat the Skyward Sword
<div class="date">Jul 25, 2015 22:20</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I played "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword" after a long interval, and eventually finished it. <br/><br/>The game was difficult for me, especially the battle scene by shaking the Wii remote controller.<br/><br/>However, it was also exciting, challenging, funny, and filling.<br/><br/>Having now completed it, I feel great satisfaction.<br/><br/>Whew.<br/><br/>To tell the truth, this is not the time to play games anymore.<br/><br/>I have to progress my study for my future.<br/><br/>From now on, I seal off all games until the end of my job hunting.
