卑猥を表す色<br/><br/>今日は「卑猥」を表す色が国によって違うことを知りました。<br/><br/>日本ではよく、卑猥な大人の映画をピンク映画と言います。<br/><br/>これは、ピンクが肌を表しているからだと言われています。<br/><br/>一方、英語ではブルーフィルムと呼ぶそうです。<br/><br/>この理由の一つとして、猥褻なフィルムを青く着色していたから、という説があります。<br/><br/>また、中国では黄色、スペインでは緑、イタリアでは赤が、それぞれ卑猥を表現する色だそうです。

<p class="correction_comment">I had never heard the word "ribald" until I read it here! It is not wrong, but depending on your audience you may choose a more ubiquitous word such as "racy".</p>

Thank you very much for the corrections and your comments!<br/><br/>&gt; maybe I am just naive?!!<br/>Haha, you  must be pure!<br/><br/>&gt; I don't understand what you mean by "coloured using blue" - can you be more specific?<br/>I heard racy parts of the film were filled by a blue line or blue lighting. However, I'm not sure whether or not it's true. The following site might be helpful:<br/><a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060901201451AArTiRc" target="_blank">https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060901201451AArTiRc</a>

Wow - there are a lot of possible reasons why the movies are called blue - but it seems it is an Americanism, and I'm from the UK hence I don't know this term :)<br/><br/>One of the suggestions was that the racy parts of the movie were censored (or partially censored) with blue tape. Was that the reason you were referencing in your post?

Yes, there seems to be many hypotheses.<br/><br/>&gt; One of the suggestions was that the racy parts of the movie were censored (or partially censored) with blue tape. Was that the reason you were referencing in your post?<br/>Maybe yes. Actually, many Japanese sentences on the Internet say something like the reason :)
