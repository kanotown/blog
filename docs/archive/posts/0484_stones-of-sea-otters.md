ラッコの石<br/><br/>今日はラッコについて書きます。<br/><br/>ラッコは大食いですが、泳ぎが苦手なため、貝を主食にしています。<br/><br/>貝を食べるときは、貝をお腹の上に置いた石に叩きつけて割ります。<br/><br/>ラッコは、霊長類を除いて唯一、道具を使う珍しい哺乳類です。<br/><br/>そして石にはこだわりがあり、お気に入りの石を決めたらずっとそれを使い続けるそうです。<br/><br/>お気に入りの石を、仲間に自慢することもあります。<br/><br/>石は基本的に、脇の下の皮膚のたるんだところに入れておくそうですが、中には決まった場所に置いて保管するラッコもいます。<br/><br/>とても可愛らしいラッコですが、性欲は異常に強いそうです。

 Hmm! Sea otters have been recorded performing forced copulation on other animals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Not exactly disturbing given that humans are equally problematic when it comes to sexual fetishes and desires.

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>&gt; Sea otters have been recorded performing forced copulation on other animals.<br/>Yeah, that information were very shocking for me..<br/>I'd like to believe that the case is quite rare.
