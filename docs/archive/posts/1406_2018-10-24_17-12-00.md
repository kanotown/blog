野暮用<br/><br/>私は今日、「野暮用」がありました。<br/><br/>「野暮用」とは、仕事のための用事や、言うまでもない取るに足らない用事のことを指す言葉です。<br/><br/>多くの場合、後者の意味で用いられます。<br/><br/>「野暮」は世情に疎いことや無粋なことを意味する語で、「用」は「用事」を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち「野暮用」とは、遊びや趣味ではない仕事上の用事や、無粋でつまらない用事というわけです。<br/><br/>この言葉は、何をしていたか/これから何をするかを、あまり答えたくないときに使われることも多いです。

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/>&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by "personal errand that is tasteless"<br/>For example, it is to buy a toothpaste, to clean a pet's toilet, etc.

I see. In that case it's better to say "trivial" instead. <br/><br/>"Tasteless" has a negative connotation and is usually used for things that are inappropriate. <br/>For example: <br/>"Everyone got angry at Bob after he told a vulgar and tasteless joke at the wedding ceremony."
