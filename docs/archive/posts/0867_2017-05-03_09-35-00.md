Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; Not sure what you mean by "answer dance."<br/>In some performances of Gagaku, performers dance first on the left side, then other performers dance on the right side. Since the second dance is something like a reply/answer to the first dance, we call it "tobu" ("to" means "answer" and "bu" means "dance").
