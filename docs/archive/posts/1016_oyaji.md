# 【No. 1016】<strong><em>Oyaji</em></strong> (親父 - Father)
<div class="date">Sep 29, 2017 17:57</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In the yesterday's post, you can find the Japanese word "oyazi" (親父), which means "father."<br/><br/>In Japan, there are several terms that mean "father," such as "otousan" (お父さん), "tousan" (父さん), "oyaji" (親父) and "papa" (パパ).<br/><br/>"Oyaji" comes from "oyachichi" (おやちち); here "oya" means "parent," and "chichi" means "father."<br/><br/>Also, although the original meaning of "oyaji" is "father," it sometimes implies an elderly man or a head of a group.<br/><br/>However, "oyaji" that isn't used to mean "father" often includes a contempt meaning.<br/><br/>For example, "oyaji gag" (親父ギャグ) means a stereotyped gag used by an older man.

親父<br/><br/>昨日の投稿の中で、「父親」を意味する「親父」という日本語が出てきました。<br/><br/>日本では、父親を呼ぶ時の言葉として、「お父さん」「父さん」「親父」「パパ」などがあります。<br/><br/>「親父」は「おやちち」が転じた言葉で、「親」は "parents," 「父」は "father" を意味します。<br/><br/>また、本来の意味は上記の通り「父親」ですが、集団の長を指すことや、単に年配男性を指すこともあります。<br/><br/>ただし、「父親」以外の意味で「親父」を使う場合は、軽蔑の意味を含むことが多いです。<br/><br/>例えば、「親父ギャグ」は、「年配の人が使う安直なギャグ」という意味で使われます。
