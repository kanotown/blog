# 【No. 1786】<strong><em>Jōhatsu</em></strong> (蒸発 - Evaporation/Missing)
<div class="date">Mar 17, 2021 23:43</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Jōhatsu</em></strong><br/><br/>Some people around me sometimes do <strong><em>jōhatsu</em></strong> (蒸発).<br/><br/><em>Jōhatsu</em> means "evaporation," and it usually refers to the process that a liquid changes into the gas phase.<br/><br/>When the subject of "evaporation/evaporate" is a person, such as <strong><em>kare wa jōhatsu shita</em></strong> (彼は蒸発した - literally means "he evaporated"), it actually means "he went missing."<br/><br/>This expression says that just as an evaporated liquid is invisible, so is an evaporated person.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the process that a substance directly from the solid to the gas state is called <strong><em>shōka</em></strong> (昇華 - "sublimation"), but <em>shōka</em> is rarely used with a person as the subject.<br/><br/>When using it like <strong><em>kare wa shōka shita</em></strong> (彼は昇華した - literally means "he sublimated"), it means something like "he became a higher state (existence) than before".

蒸発<br/><br/>私の周りで「蒸発」する人がまれにいます。<br/><br/>「蒸発」は "evaporation" を意味し、通常は液体が気体の状態になる過程のことを表します。<br/><br/>「蒸発」の主語を人にして、「彼は蒸発した」のように使うと、「彼は行方不明（音信不通）になった」といった意味になります。<br/><br/>液体が気体になると見えなくなるように、「蒸発した人」も見えないというわけです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、個体から気体になることは「昇華」と言いますが、人を主語にして使うことはほとんどありません。<br/><br/>仮に「彼は昇華した」のように使った場合、「彼は一段階高度な状態（存在）になった」のような意味になります。

 Interesting! In English, sometimes we'd (jokingly) say 'He has ascended to a different plane of existence'.

 I've heard that it's relatively easy to vanish in Japan because your nation has very strict laws concerning privacy.  Actually, I'm feeling rather intrigued about the people you knew who vanished into thin air/vanished without a trace...

Yes, unfortunately, there are many missing people in Japan. The disappearance is often not reported to the police, so it often ends with unknown details.

 You can use "evaporate" the same way in English as well (eg. He evaporated.) but it's probably not as common as in Japanese.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I had never heard the word "sublimate." Maybe it's because I never really studied science seriously haha.

Thank you for the correction and explanation! I learned something new.<br/>I think that about 2-30% of Japanese people understand the meaning of the term 昇華. :)
