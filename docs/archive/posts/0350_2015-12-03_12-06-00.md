<div class="date">Dec 3, 2015 12:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Japan, there are two major ways to ride an escalator.<br/><br/>In Kanto region (Tokyo area), people stand on the left side, and give the right side to other people in a hurry.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in Kansai region (Osaka, Kyoto area), people stand on the right side, and space the right side.<br/><br/>According to the Internet, people seem to stand the left side in some countries, such as UK, Australia, or Singapore.<br/><br/>Also, people seem to stand the right side in other countries, such as the US, Canada, or France.<br/><br/>However, the correct riding way is to stand the center, and not to walk on the escalator.<br/><br/>These days, Japanese railway companies have appealed such a usage to people.

エスカレーター<br/><br/>日本では、エスカレーターの乗り方が大きく2種類あります。<br/><br/>関東地方（東京方面）では、左側に立って、右側を追い越す人のために空けます。<br/><br/>一方。関西地方（大阪・京都方面）ではは、右側に立って、左側を空けます。<br/><br/>インターネットによると、イギリスやオーストラリア、シンガポールなどは左側に立つようです。<br/><br/>そして、アメリカやカナダ、フランスなどでは右側に立つようです。<br/><br/>しかし、本来エスカレーター上では歩かずに中央に立つのが正しい乗り方であり、最近日本の鉄道会社はそのことを利用者に呼びかけています。

 In my part of the US, we stand in the middle, and if you're in a hurry (like at an airport) you may walk up, but nobody ever walks down. I don't know what people do in crowded places.
 <br/>
 私の米国の地方には、みんなさんはエスカレーターで中央に乗ります。（フライトに）大事な事を遅刻なら、歩けますよ。しかし、誰も下の方向で歩きません。
 <br/>
 私は大勢の位置でエスカレーターの乗り方を知りません。

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>You're corrections are very useful to me.<br/><br/>And thank you for letting me know about the situation in the US. Actually, these information that I wrote is from comments in an online article. So they seem to be only true for a small part.<br/><br/>Also, although it's risky and many accidents have happened, many Japanese people walk up and down on escalators. I found the following video, which shows escalators in Singapore:<br/><object height="315" width="560">
<param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/7fNDgwp_w_s"/>
<embed height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/7fNDgwp_w_s" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560"/>
</object>
<br/>I feel that this atmosphere is very similar to stations in Japan.
