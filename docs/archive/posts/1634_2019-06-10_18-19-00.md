# 【No. 1634】<strong><em>Shiri ga Karui</strong></em> (尻が軽い - Hasty)
<div class="date">Jun 10, 2019 18:19</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Shiri ga Karui</strong></em><br/><br/>I do not like people who are described as <strong><em>shiri ga karui</em></strong> (尻が軽い).<br/><br/><em>Shiri ga karui</em> means that someone's behavior is thoughtless or hasty; especially it is used to describe women who often play around.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>shiri</em></strong> (尻) means "hip" and <strong><em>karui</em></strong> (軽い) means "light," the literal meaning of <em>shiri ga karui</em> is "one's hip is light."<br/><br/>It is difficult for people having a light hip to sit still in one place, so this idiom came to have the above meanings.<br/><br/>You can say <strong><em>shirigaru</em></strong> (尻軽) by shortening <em>shiri ga karui</em>.

尻が軽い<br/><br/>私は「尻が軽い」人があまり好きではありません。<br/><br/>「尻が軽い」は、行いが軽々しいことや軽はずみであることを意味する言葉で、特に浮気性な女性に対して使われることが多いです。<br/><br/>「尻」は "hip"、「軽い」は "light" を意味するので、「尻が軽い」の文字どおりの意味は "one's hip is light" となります。<br/><br/>尻が軽くて一つの場所にじっと座っていられないことから、上記のような意味を持つようになったというわけです。<br/><br/>「尻が軽い」を省略して「尻軽」と言うこともあります。

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/>&gt; I think "hip" is "腸骨(のあたり）" right?<br/>Probably you're right. :)<br/>I think 'shiri' can also be translated as "buttock."
