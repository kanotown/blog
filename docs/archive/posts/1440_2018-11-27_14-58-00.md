# Nerds' Birthday
<div class="date">Nov 27, 2018 14:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Nerds' Birthday<br/><br/>A few days ago, I found an interesting theory on the Internet.<br/><br/>That is "Nerds tend to be born in the winter."<br/><br/>In Japan, school begins on April 1st.<br/><br/>Therefore, if someone is born in the winter such as February or March, there will be a difference of about 10 months (maximum almost 1 year) with those who are born in April or May despite being in the same grade.<br/><br/>Since the difference is huge for children, they could become to dislike sports and exercise, then become nerds.<br/><br/>Although this theory is not statistically supported, there is another interesting fact; "Japanese professional athletes tend to be born in April - June."

オタクの誕生日<br/><br/>先日、インターネット上で面白い説を見ました。<br/><br/>それは「オタクは冬生まれが多い」というものです。<br/><br/>日本では、4月1日、すなわち春から学校が始まります。<br/><br/>このため、2〜3月などの冬に生まれると、同学年の4〜5月生まれの人とは10ヶ月ほど（最大で約1年）の差が生じます。<br/><br/>幼少期にとってこの差は大きく、スポーツや運動が嫌いになり、オタクになるということです。<br/><br/>この説の裏付けはなされていませんが、興味深い事実として、日本のプロスポーツ選手は4〜6月生まれが多いそうです。
