# 【No. 0146】Website Design
<div class="date">May 13, 2015 22:10</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Recently, I was asked a website design of a venture contest.<br/><br/>I didn't have enough time, but for my school and living expenses, I decided to accept the request.<br/><br/>And today, I was making the website almost all day.<br/><br/>It seems I need extra time to complete it.

先日、私はベンチャーコンテストのホームページ制作を依頼されました。<br/><br/>あまり時間に余裕はありませんでしたが、生活費のために依頼を受けました。<br/><br/>そして今日は一日中、ホームページを作っていました。<br/><br/>完成にはもう少し時間がかかりそうです。
