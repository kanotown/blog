# 【No. 0030】Create an X-ray CT Simulator
<div class="date">Jan 17, 2015 19:17</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I finished creating an X-ray CT simulation software for my client of the dentist, and delivered it.<br/><br/>It took me about 3 weeks.<br/><br/>Because I had to create it alone, it was really hard to debug it.<br/><br/>However, in spite of my exertions, some bugs might remained.<br/><br/>I think the client will report some bugs or request additional function to me within a week, and I will reply to his request.<br/><br/>The software development process is(maybe) referred to as the spiral model which was proposed by Barry Boehm in 1988.<br/><br/>Actually, I just wanted to use the words "spiral model" because I felt the sound was cool.<br/><br/>And after that, I've learned English words patiently.
