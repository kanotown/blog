# 【No. 0711】<strong><em>Benke no Nakidokoro</em></strong> (Benke's Weak Point)
<div class="date">Nov 28, 2016 16:23</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "benke no nakidokoro."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "Benke's weak point," and it expresses "shin" (that is a part of your body), "weak point" or "vital spot" .<br/><br/>In the past in Japan, there was a tough heroic figure named "Musashibo Benke".<br/><br/>Although he was heavily built, he cried when he would be kicked his shin, so this term was made.<br/><br/>By the way, it is said "Achilles' heel" in English.<br/><br/>Achilles is a legendary and immortal hero in Greek mythology, but he had the only weak point on his heel, so this term was made.<br/><br/>The term "Achilles tendon" comes from the same story.

弁慶の泣き所<br/><br/>今日は「弁慶の泣き所」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「弁慶の泣き所」は身体の「向こう脛」を表し、転じて「急所」や「弱点」も表します。<br/><br/>日本にはかつて、武蔵坊弁慶という豪傑がいました。<br/><br/>彼のような頑丈な人間でも、皮膚に近いところにある向う脛の骨を蹴られると痛くて泣いたことから、この言葉ができたとされています。<br/><br/>ちなみに、英語では "Achilles' heel" （アキレスの踵）と言うようです。<br/><br/>アキレスはギリシャ神話に登場する不死身の伝説的英雄ですが、かかとが唯一の弱点だったことからこの言葉ができました。<br/><br/>「アキレス腱」という言葉の由来でもあります。
