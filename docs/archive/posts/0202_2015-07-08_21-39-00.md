<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
This morning, my mother departed for my apartment in order to get repair her laptop.<br/><br/>It was so suddenly event.<br/><br/>The distance between my mother's home and my apartment is around 300 km, so traveling time become around four hours by car.<br/><br/>In that four hours, I had to clean my room desperately because ... as you may have guessed.<br/><br/>After four hours, my mother reached my apartment and I invited her to my room.<br/><br/>She seemed to be satisfied and praised me, haha, yes.<br/><br/>I repaired her laptop quickly, then we went to a hot spring.<br/><br/>We healed our body fatigue, and ate dinner while talking various things.<br/><br/>It was so nice time.

<p class="correction_comment">It is accurate to say "departed" but it sounds a little funny in this sentence. I would just say "...my mother left for my apartment," or "...my mother came to my apartment."</p>

<p class="correction_comment">"We rested," or "the hot spring was very relaxing" might be more natural than "we healed our body fatigue." You can say that if you want, it is okay, but it sounds a little bit artificial.</p>

It was so nice <span class="f_red">a</span> time.
