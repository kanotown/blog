コログ構文 Part 1<br/><br/>最近SNSで、「コログ構文」がしばしば使われるのを見かけます。<br/><br/>「コログ」とは、ゼルダの伝説シリーズに登場する架空のキャラクターです。<br/><br/>また、「構文」は "syntax" を意味するので、「コログ構文」の文字どおりの意味は "Korok's syntax" となります。<br/><br/>このキャラクターは、「ゼルダの伝説  ティアーズ オブ ザ キングダム」において、しばしば「もう疲れちゃって 全然動けなくてェ･･･」というセリフを吐きます。<br/><br/>このセリフは日本語ではやや特徴的な言い回しであり、このような文章の構成が「コログ構文」と呼ばれるものです。

 I remember reading similar lines in both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.

Thank you for the correction!<br/><br/>To tell you the truth, in the English version of the dialogue, there was "I can't wait to catch up!" right before "I'm so tired though. I can't move...". I ignored the flow of the dialogue and clipped the latter part, making it seem unnatural.

<p class="correction_comment">"Though" (けど、たとえ) doesn't make sense here, and you must not insert a period ('.') between "I'm so tired" and "I can't move". You need to study the construction "so &lt;adjective&gt; that ..." (in this case, "so tired that"). Using the comma instead is really a short form for this.</p>

Thank you for the correction and kind explanation!<br/><br/>Actually, the original lines in the English version of the game were, "&lt;...&gt; I can't wait to catch up! I'm so tired though. I can't move...". I took the latter part out of context, which might have made it sound unnatural. Also, since Korok is a very small, child-like character, there could have been an intention to make its lines sound more childlike.

I didn't understand that the translation you gave was part of an official English translation of the game. It does make a difference that "I'm so tired, though" is a qualification of the previous sentence "I can't wait to catch up!"-- "though" presumably does have the meaning けど in this context. I thought you were providing your own English translation of もう疲れちゃって 全然動けなくてェ. For this sentence alone, even given its oddity in Japanese, "though" doesn't make sense as part of the translation.

Thank you for your comment! From now on, I will indicate clearly when I quote English text from somewhere and make sure that the sentences make sense on their own.
