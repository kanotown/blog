# <strong><em>Katai</strong></em> (Hard/Solid/Stiff)
<div class="date">Aug 19, 2016 20:16</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the kanji for the Japanese word "katai."<br/><br/>"Katai" has three different kanji, "固い," "硬い" and "堅い."<br/><br/>I think that it will become easy to remember the differences by understanding these antonyms.<br/><br/>①固い<br/>"固い" is the most common writing among them.<br/>This kanji expresses that something is hard/rigid/firm, and the general antonym is "緩い" (loose/lax).<br/>For example: "結び目が固い" (The knot is hard/tight) / "頭が固い" (He has a hard head)<br/><br/>②硬い<br/>"硬い" expresses that something is strong/hard/stiff.<br/>The antonym is "柔らかい" (soft/flexible).<br/>For example: "硬い石" (a hard rock) / "表情が硬い" (your expression is stiff)<br/><br/>③堅い<br/>"堅い" expresses that something is solid, or has high certainty.<br/>The antonym is "もろい" (fragile/frail).<br/>For example: "私は意思が堅い" (I am stubborn) / "身持ちが堅い" (she is a virtuous woman) / "彼の勝利は堅い" (his victory is stable)<br/><br/>There are many cases where you can use both of them.<br/><br/>By the way, "難い" is also read as "katai," but the meaning is something like "it's difficult/hard to do."<br/><br/>Note that you can't use this kanji instead of other "katai."<br/><br/>(I think it can be exchanged for other "katai" in English, because all of "katai" can be translated into "hard.")

かたい<br/><br/>今日は、「かたい」という日本語の漢字について話します。<br/><br/>「かたい」は、「固い」「硬い」「堅い」の三つの漢字表記ができます。<br/><br/>それぞれの違いは、対義語を理解すると覚えやすいと思います。<br/><br/>①固い<br/>「固い」はもっともよく使われる表記です。<br/>しっかりしていて丈夫な様子を表し、対義語は「緩い」です。<br/>（例：結び目が固い / 頭が固い）<br/><br/>②硬い<br/>「硬い」は力強い様子や、こわばっている様子を表します。<br/>対義語は「柔らかい」です。<br/>（例：硬い石 / 表情が硬い）<br/><br/>③堅い<br/>「堅い」は中身がしっかり詰まっている様子や確実性が高い様子を表します。<br/>対義語は「もろい」です。<br/>（例：私は意思が堅い / 彼女は身持ちが堅い / 彼の勝利は堅い）<br/><br/>これらの漢字は交換可能なケースも多く存在します。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「難い」は同じ読み方をしますが、意味は "it's difficult/hard to do" と全く異なるので交換はできません。<br/><br/>（英語でなら交換できそうです。）

 I think I understood the final two sentences but their meaning is somewhat complex.

 <br/>
 If I understood correctly it's because in English "hard" also means difficult.

Thank you very much again for correcting my post!<br/><br/>&gt; I hope I understood the meaning.<br/>I think you understand what I wanted to say.<br/>All of "固い," "硬い" and "堅い" have similar meanings, but "難い" has a different meaning.<br/><br/>&gt; If I understood correctly it's because in English "hard" also means difficult.<br/>Yes, that's what I wanted to mention :)

Thank you for the comment!<br/><br/>&gt; Does 'he has a hard head' also mean that 'he's adamant/stubborn' ?<br/>Yes, I think so. However, "頭が固い" has a negative nuance, while "意思が堅い" has a positive nuance.<br/><br/>&gt; Instead of 'his victory is stable', can I use'his victory is certain'?<br/>Yes, maybe. By the way, I think "彼の勝利は堅い" implies that the probability of his victory is 80-90 %. So perhaps I should add an adverb like "almost" before "stable/certain."
