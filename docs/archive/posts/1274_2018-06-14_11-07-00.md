# 【No. 1274】<strong><em>Tosaka ni Kuru</strong></em> (トサカにくる - Getting Mad)
<div class="date">Jun 14, 2018 11:07</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I introduced you to "atama ni kuru" (頭にくる), which means a feeling of anger.<br/><br/>There is a slang term, "tosaka ni kuru" (トサカにくる), which was derived from "atama ni kuru."<br/><br/>Tosaka (トサカ) means a red protrusion (cockscomb) on the top of a chicken and kuru (来る) means <em>to come,</em> so the literal meaning of this term is "something comes on one's cockscomb."<br/><br/>This term represents that blood come up to one's head (or the top of the head) due to anger, and it can imply stronger angry than "atama ni kuru."<br/><br/>Incidentally, there are several theories about the reasons why chickens have cockscomb; for threatening to male, appeal to female, temperature regulation, and remnants from their ancestor (dinosaur).

トサカにくる<br/><br/>昨日は「怒りの感情」を意味する「頭にくる」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>「頭にくる」から派生した俗語に、「トサカにくる」があります。<br/><br/>「トサカ」は鶏の頭上にある赤い突起のことです。<br/><br/>怒って頭に血が上ったようす（もしくは頭を通り越して頭上に達したようす）を表現した言葉であり、「頭にくる」よりも強い怒りを表します。<br/><br/>ちなみに、鶏などの頭上にトサカがある理由は諸説あり、雄への威嚇、雌へのアピール、体温調節、先祖（恐竜）の名残などが考えられています。
