バッタもん<br/><br/>今日は「バッタもん」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「バッタもん」は、正規のルートで仕入れたものではない「正規品」を意味します。<br/><br/>正規品ではありますが、期限切れの商品や梱包が劣化した商品など、正規の流通ルートでは売りさばきにくいものが多く、格安であることが多いです。<br/><br/>元々「ばった」は、「投げ売り」を意味する商人の隠語だったそうです。<br/><br/>そこから、商品を格安で売る店や非正規のルートで商品を仕入れる店を「バッタ屋」と呼ぶようになり、そこで売られる商品を「バッタもん」と呼ぶようになりました。<br/><br/>同様の理由から、現在では「偽物の商品」や「粗悪品」を指すことも多いです。
