# 【No. 0959】<strong><em>Shoki Barai</strong></em> (暑気払い - Beating the Summer Heat)
<div class="date">Aug 3, 2017 13:15</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, my colleagues and I conducted "shoki barai" (暑気払い).<br/><br/>"Shoki" of "shoki barai" means "heat," and "harai" means to take something off.<br/><br/>Therefore, "shoki barai" literally refers to taking heat that is accumulated in our bodies off by drinking cold drinks or eating cold food in the hot summer.<br/><br/>However, if you say "shoki barai" in our time, it usually means just a banquet or a drinking party that is held for beating the heat, reducing stress, and relieving fatigue.<br/><br/>As far as I know, beer garden etc. are often planned as the "shoki barai."

暑気払い<br/><br/>昨日は暑気払いをしました。<br/><br/>暑気払いとは、暑い夏に冷たい食べ物や飲み物で、体に溜まった熱気を取り除くことを意味します。<br/><br/>文字どおり、暑さをうち払うということです。<br/><br/>ただ、現在において暑気払いと言うと、暑さやストレスを発散するための飲み会を指すことがほとんどです。<br/><br/>ビアガーデンなどが、よく暑気払いとして企画されています。
