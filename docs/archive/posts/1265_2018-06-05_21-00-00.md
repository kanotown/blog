<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Nezi wo Maku</strong></em> (ねじを巻く - Rolling up One's Sleeves)</h1>
<div class="date">Jun 5, 2018 21:00</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
When making someone/oneself improve their/one's loose attitudes, it is called neji wo maku (ねじを巻く) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Neji (ねじ) means "screw," maku (巻く) means "to wind something," so the literal meaning of neji wo maku is "to screw up" or "to tighten a screw."<br/><br/>If you tighten a screw, of course, a loose state will be tightened.<br/><br/>This idiom is comparing the loose state with people's loose attitudes or feelings.<br/><br/>It is an interesting fact that this Japanese idiom has the positive meaning, whereas the English term "to screw up" can mean "to mess up."

ねじを巻く<br/><br/>だらしない行動や態度をきちんとさせることを、「ねじを巻く」と言います。<br/><br/>「ねじ」は "screw" 、「巻く」は "to wind something" を意味するため、「ねじを巻く」の文字通りの意味は "to screw up" です。<br/><br/>ねじを巻けば、ゆるんだ状態が引き締まります。<br/><br/>ねじのゆるんだ状態を、人のだらしない状態や気持ちにたとえているわけです。<br/><br/>日本語の「ねじを巻く」は良い意味なのに対し、英語の "screw up" は「台無しにする」ことを意味する事実は、とても興味深いです。

<p class="comment_small">
 Rarely do we define attitudes as being loose in English although that may not be the case in Japanese.  Lazy attitude maybe ?

Thank you so much for the correction! :)<br/>Actually, Japanese people often use the word 'loose' (ルーズ) as a kind of personality. But maybe 'lazy' is more appropriate as what I wanted to say.
