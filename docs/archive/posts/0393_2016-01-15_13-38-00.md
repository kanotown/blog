# 【No. 0393】Classroom Cleaning
<div class="date">Jan 15, 2016 13:38</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to introduce a custom of Japanese schools.<br/><br/>Japanese schools (except university/college) usually don't hire a cleaning staff,  students clean their classrooms and equipment.<br/><br/>In most cases, all students are separated into several groups, and each group cleans a classroom, a hallway, a toilet, or a schoolyard, respectively, everyday.<br/><br/>If you search for "Japan school cleaning" on Google Images, you will find the scenes (which are so nostalgic for me...).<br/><br/>For these reasons, I think we would become to use public facilities carefully so as not to blemish them.<br/><br/>By the way, in most Japanese elementary/junior high/high schools, we change into indoor shoes when we enter the school buildings.

教室の掃除<br/><br/>今日は、日本の学校における習慣を紹介します。<br/><br/>日本の学校（大学を除く）は通常清掃員を雇っておらず、生徒たちが教室や設備の掃除をします。<br/><br/>大抵の場合、幾つかのグループに分かれて、教室・廊下・トイレ・校庭などを分担してクラス全員で毎日掃除します。<br/><br/>「日本　学校　掃除」などで画像検索すると、その様子を見ることができます（懐かしい・・・）。<br/><br/>このような理由から、私たちは自然と公共の設備も綺麗に使うようになるのだと思います。<br/><br/>ちなみに、日本のほとんどの小中高等学校では、校舎に入るときに靴を上履きに履き替えます。

<p class="correction_comment">A list of items in English must have "and" or "or" before the last item, and the earlier items are separated by commas. The "and" or "or" may be preceded by a comma, but that is optional. It is usually done if the items are long phrases, or if there is at least one phrase containing the word "and".<br/>When people use / in their corrections, they are asking you to choose one of the alternatives; / is not used this way when the sentence is written in its final form, with the exception of the usage "and/or".</p>

 Very well written!

Thank you very much for the corrections and your kind explanations!<br/>I learned something new. I had used "/" as the meaning of "or" until today.

Your intended meaning was "and" in this case, not "or". You were saying that something happens in all three kinds of schools-- elementary schools, junior high schools, and high schools-- not in one or the other of these three kinds of schools.<br/><br/>By the way, I believe that the terms "junior high school" and "high school" are used only in US English. The terms used in UK English are "primary school" (which corresponds to "elementary school" in the US) and "secondary school" (which corresponds to the remaining years before university).
