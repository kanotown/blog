今日は、私のPCからWindows10テクニカルプレビューをアンインストールをし、Windows8を再インストールしました。<br/><br/>Windows10のデザインはそこそこ好きでしたが、頻繁にフリーズするようになってしまったので、仕事になりませんでした。<br/><br/>OSとソフトウェアを入れ直して前の状態に戻すのに、およそ5時間かかりました。<br/><br/>新しいものが出たらすぐに飛びつくのは、今後控えようと思います。

 Oh no. Hope your programs are running properly now.

 It's always tempting to update to a new OS but then the regret sets in after 10 minutes. Haha
