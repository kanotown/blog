# 【No. 1248】<strong><em>Fune wo Kogu</strong></em> (船を漕ぐ - Rowing a Boat)
<div class="date">May 20, 2018 00:03</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I often do an act called fune wo kogu (船を漕ぐ) on my  chair.<br/><br/>Fune (船) means "a boat" or "a ship" and kogu (漕ぐ) means "to row."<br/><br/>Of course, the expression fune wo kogu can literally mean to row a boat.<br/><br/>However, if someone says it in a conversation unrelated to "boat/shio" nor "sea/ocean," it would mean to nod off or to be about to fall asleep.<br/><br/>Because a person who is about to fall asleep moves the body forwards and backwards and it looks as if he/her is rowing a boat.

<div id="post_ja"><div id="body_show_mo">
船を漕ぐ<br/><br/>私はよく椅子の上で「船を漕ぎます」。<br/><br/>「船」は "boat," 「漕ぐ」は "to row" を意味します。<br/><br/>もちろん「船を漕ぐ」という表現は、文字通り "to row a boat" を意味することもあります。<br/><br/>しかし、「船」や「海」と関係のない会話でこの表現が登場した場合、それは「居眠りすること」や「今にも眠りそうなこと」を意味します。<br/><br/>今にも眠りそうな人は、まるで船を漕いでいるかのように見えるからです。

 Great job!! This is my first time to hear that expression, but I can completely understand the meaning. I used to often do this while I was a student.
