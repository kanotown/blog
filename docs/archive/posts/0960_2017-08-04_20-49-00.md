お冷<br/><br/>昨日は飲み会に関する記事を書きました。<br/><br/>日本の居酒屋では、多くの場合、最後に「お冷」を頼みます。<br/><br/>「お冷」は「冷たい」を意味する「冷（ひや）」に丁寧の接頭辞「お」がついたものであり、基本的には冷たい水を指します。<br/><br/>かつては「お冷やし」と言われ、宮中の女性の間で「水」を指す丁寧な言葉として使われていました。<br/><br/>江戸時代以降は男女問わず使われるようになり、現在では特に居酒屋などで用いられます。<br/><br/>「お冷」から「お」をとって「冷や」とだけ言うと、常温もしくは冷たい日本酒を指すことが多いので、注意して下さい。

"Ohiya" is composed of the polite prefix "o" (お) and <span class="sline">the</span> "hiya" (冷や), meaning "cold," <span class="sline">and it</span> usually refer<span class="f_blue">ring</span> to "cold water."
<p class="correction_comment">This sentence is technically perfect, but for a formal essay, it would be better to avoid the wording you've chosen for the last clause. It could also be separated into a second sentence.</p>

<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">It was once called as "ohiyashi" (お冷やし), and as used as a polite term that means "mizu" (水 - water) by women in the imperial court.</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
It was once <span class="f_blue">known as</span> "ohiyashi" (お冷やし) and <span class="sline"><span class="f_blue">w</span>as</span> used <span class="f_blue">by women in the imperial court</span> as a polite term <span class="f_blue">meaning </span>"mizu" (水 - water) .
<p class="correction_comment">You could keep the word 'was' and the original placement of the phrase 'by women in the imperial court', but the 'was' is technically not necessary and the meaning of the sentence is clearer if you move this phrase to clarify who used the term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">After the Edo period, it has come to be used regardless of gender, and now it's often used in Japanese-style bars/pubs.</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
After the Edo period, it has come to be used <span class="f_blue">by all </span>regardless of gender, and<span class="f_blue"> is now</span> often used in Japanese-style bars/pubs.
<p class="correction_comment">Repeating the subject 'it' is unnecessary. This sentence sounds more formal and fluid if you simply use 'is now.'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">Note that if you omit the prefix "o" and just say "hiya," it will mean cold/room-temperature Japanese sake.</li>
