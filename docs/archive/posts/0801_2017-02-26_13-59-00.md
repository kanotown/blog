801<br/><br/>二日前、Lang-8での投稿数が800に達しました。<br/><br/>つまり、昨日は801回目の投稿です。<br/><br/>「801」は、男性同性愛を扱う女性向け作品の俗称として使用されることがあります。<br/><br/>このとき、「801」は「やおい」と呼ばれます。<br/><br/>この言葉は、同人誌でありがちな「やま（山場）なし」「おちなし」「いみなし」という三つの要素の頭文字をとってできたものとされています。<br/><br/>当初は性的な意味合いは含まれておらず、質の低い漫画を指す言葉として用いられていましたが、現在では主にボーイズラブ作品を指す言葉に変化しました。<br/><br/>欧米における「スラッシュ」と呼ばれる言葉に近いと思います。

 Believe me, I know yaoi. I'm picky though. A lot of it is trashy, but there are a few I do like. I prefer shounen ai. Seven Days and Doukyuusei are really good!

Thank you so much for the corrections! :)<br/>I didn't know these manga (movies?), but if they are excellent as works or have good stories, maybe you shouldn't call it 801, haha.
