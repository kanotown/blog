# 【No. 0682】<strong><em>Mago nimo Isho</strong></em> (Clothes Make the Man)
<div class="date">Oct 30, 2016 14:09</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the proverb "mago nimo isho."<br/><br/>"Mago" means a person who carries people and luggage while leading a horse, and "isho" means dress clothes.<br/>(Currently in Japan, there is almost no people who work as mago.)<br/><br/>This proverb expresses that everyone will look good by wearing dress clothes, even if he/she is a low ranked person like mago. <br/><br/>Note that if you say this proverb to others, it can be rude.<br/><br/>Also, since the reading "mago" can mean "grandchild", some people think that "mago nimo isho" means "any cloth suits a grandchild," but this thought is wrong.

馬子にも衣装<br/><br/>今日は「馬子にも衣装」ということわざを紹介します。<br/><br/>「馬子」とは馬をひいて人や荷物を運ぶことを職業とした人を意味します。<br/><br/>このことわざは、馬子のような身分の低い人でも、身なりを整えれば立派に見えることを表します。<br/><br/>無下に他人に使うと失礼にあたりますので、注意して下さい。<br/><br/>「馬子」と「孫」の読みが同じであることから、「孫にも衣装（孫はどんな服を着てもかわいい）」と思っている人もいますが、これは間違いです。

Also, since <span class="sline">the reading </span>"mago" <span class="sline">can mean</span> <span class="f_blue">is said the same way as </span>"grandchild"<span class="f_blue"> in Japanese</span>, some people think that "mago nimo isho" means "any cloth<span class="f_blue">ing</span> suits a grandchild," but this thought is wrong.
<p class="correction_comment">Saying "the reading" is not wrong, but English-speaking people who don't know about kanji may not understand. So I changed your wording a bit. You could also say that "mago" and "grandchild" are homonyms (同音異義語) in Japanese, and people should understand.</p>

 Great job! This is a very interesting proverb and I have never heard the word "mago" before, so I learned a lot, too. :)
