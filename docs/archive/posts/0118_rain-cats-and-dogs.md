今日は、一時的に土砂降りでした。<br/><br/>英語には「ひどく雨が降る」という表現が幾つかあります。<br/><br/>・It's raining cats and dogs.<br/>・It's coming down in buckets.<br/>・It's really coming down.<br/>・It's pouring.<br/>・It is the heavens open.<br/><br/>Cats と dogs ななぜ土砂降りを意味しているかは、様々な説がありますが、最も有力な説の一つは、北欧神話のようです。<br/><br/>北欧神話では、猫は雨を降らせる力があり、犬は風を起こす力があるとされています。<br/><br/>実際、ヨーロッパの国々では、悪天候のことを「犬（狼）の天気」と言うそうです。<br/><br/>また、英語で cats and dogs と言えば仲が悪いことを意味しますが、日本では犬猿の仲（dogs and monkeys relationship）と言います。

 Interesting story, Why do dogs and monkeys have a bad relationship?
</p>

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>&gt; Why do dogs and monkeys have a bad relationship?<br/>There are also various hypotheses.<br/>One of them is come from hunting with dogs. Mankind began to hunt to mountains with dogs, and there were many monkeys in mountains in Japan. Since monkeys are territorial animals, monkeys and dogs often get into a fight.
