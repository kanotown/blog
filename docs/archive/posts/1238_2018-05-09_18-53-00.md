寒い5月<br/><br/>昨日の東京の最高気温は約14度でした。<br/><br/>そして、今日の最高気温も約14度でした。<br/><br/>寒いです。<br/><br/>記録によると、5月になってから2日連続で最高気温が15度未満となるのは、25年ぶりだそうです。<br/><br/>それなのに、天気予報の情報によると、来週は最高気温が30度になるそうです。<br/><br/>二倍です。<br/><br/>これだけ気温の変化が激しいと、体調を崩しやすくなる恐れがあります。<br/><br/>来週にはとても大事な予定が入っているので、気をつけなければなりません。

<p class="correction_comment">although grammatically correct, by saying this in two clauses it seems to unnaturally separate the cause from the effect . The weather change is what can upset your health.</p>
