対談<br/><br/>今日は、「対談」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「対談」は "talk" や "conversation," "interview" などと訳されることが多いですが、厳密には異なります。<br/><br/>「対談」の「対」は、「一対」("pair") や 「一対一」("one-to-one") といった意味を持ち、「談」は「会話」(conversation) との意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>すなわち、「対談」は「2人で行う話し合い」を意味し、3人以上の会議などには使えません。<br/><br/>3人での話し合い「鼎談」と言いますが、あまり一般的に使われる言葉ではありません。<br/><br/>個人的には、3人以上であれば「会議」「会談」「ミーティング」「話し合い」などと言うのが良いと思います。
