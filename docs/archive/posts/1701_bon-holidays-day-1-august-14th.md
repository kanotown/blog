# 【No. 1701】Bon Holidays: Day 1 (August 14th)
<div class="date">Aug 17, 2019 22:09</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Bon Holidays: Day 1 (August 14th)<br/><br/>During this period in Japan, many Japanese people are on Bon Holidays.<br/><br/>I was working in Bon holidays for the last several years, but I decided to rest and go play outside this year.<br/><br/>First, I went to Tokyo Disneyland with my friend.<br/><br/>The number of visitors per year to Tokyo Disneyland is around 17 million -- this is the third-largest number in all amusement parks in the world.<br/><br/>Since it was a day of Bon holidays, Disneyland was very crowded, but we could enjoy enough.<br/><br/>I walked and stand for a long time after a long time, so I was very tired.<br/><br/>Incidentally, although it is Tokyo Disneyland, it is not located in Tokyo -- it is actually located in Chiba (next to Tokyo).

お盆休み　一日目（8月14日）<br/><br/>この時期、日本はお盆休みです。<br/><br/>私はここ数年、お盆も仕事をしてきましたが、今年はしっかりと休んだり遊んだりすることにしました。<br/><br/>まずは、東京ディズニーランドに行きました。<br/><br/>東京ディズニーランドの来場者数は年間約1700万人で、世界のアミューズメントパークの中でも3位の規模です。<br/><br/>お盆休みということもあり、かなり混雑していましたが、楽しめました。<br/><br/>久々に長時間歩いたり立ったりしたので、くたくたです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「東京ディズニーランド」という名前ですが、実際には「東京都」ではなくその隣の「千葉県」にあります。

 I think it'd be a lot of fun to go to Tokyo disney one day!  My daughter and I watch videos of some of the rides they have that aren't in Disney World in Florida, which is also a great time!

Thank you for the correction!<br/>Yes, the rides are fantastic, but I think that the waiting time for riding them (especially on holidays) in Tokyo Disneyland is too long, haha.
