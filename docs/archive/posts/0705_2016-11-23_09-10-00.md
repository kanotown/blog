<div class="date">Nov 23, 2016 09:10</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Recently, I've talked about Japanese phrases related to cats.<br/><br/>Today I would like to talk about the two Japanese proverbs "neko ni katsuobushi" and "neko ni matatabi."<br/><br/>Cats like both "katsuobushi" and "matatabi", but the meanings of these proverbs are different from each other.<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "neko ni katsuobushi" is "dried bonito to cats," and it expresses to fall into a dangerous situation. <br/><br/>This comes from the fact that if you put dried bonito in front of a cat, the cat will eat it very quickly.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the literal meaning of "neko ni matatabi" is "silver vine to cats," and it expresses that something is very effective.<br/><br/>This comes from the fact that if you give a cat silver vine, the cat become happy  drunkenly.

猫に鰹節と猫にまたたび<br/><br/>最近、私な猫に関することわざや単語について投稿しています。<br/><br/>今日は、「猫に鰹節」と「猫にまたたび」の二つのことわざを紹介します。<br/><br/>「鰹節」と「またたび」はどちらも猫の好物ですが、これらのことわざの意味は大きく異なります。<br/><br/>「猫に鰹節」は、「危険な状況を招くこと」を意味します。<br/><br/>猫の目の前に好物の鰹節を置くと、すぐに食べられてしまうことに由来します。<br/><br/>一方、「猫にまたたび」は、「非常に好きであること」や「効果が著しいこと」を意味します。<br/><br/>猫にまたたびを与えると、酔っ払ったように喜ぶことに由来します。
