# 【No. 1185】<strong><em>Uba Zakura</strong></em> (姥桜) Part 2
<div class="date">Mar 17, 2018 22:18</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I introduced you to the Japanese term 姥桜 (uba zakura), which is a popular name for cherry trees in which flowers bloom earlier than leaves.<br/><br/>Actually, "uba zakura" can also describe a woman who is past her prime but is beautiful still now.<br/><br/>That is to say, this term is surely a compliment.<br/><br/>However, since 姥 (uba) means "old lady," some Japanese people are regarding this term as an insult, such as "just a woman past her prime" or "a woman who is trying to make herself look young."<br/><br/>Please be careful when you use it to women.

姥桜 Part 2<br/><br/>昨日は、葉が出るよりも先に花が咲く桜の通称「姥桜」を紹介しました。<br/><br/>この「姥桜」という言葉は、盛りを過ぎてもなお美しい女性を表すこともできます。<br/><br/>すなわち、この言葉はれっきとした褒め言葉です。<br/><br/>しかし、"old lady" を意味する「姥」という文字が使われていることから、「女盛りを過ぎた女性」や「若作りをしている女性」など、悪い印象を持っている人も多くいるようです。<br/><br/>この言葉を女性に対して使う際は、注意して下さい。
