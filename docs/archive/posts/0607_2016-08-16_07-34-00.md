# 【No. 0607】Traffic Jams due to a Return Home
<div class="date">Aug 16, 2016 07:34</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
For many Japanese people, Bon holidays will end today.<br/><br/>Therefore, people who returned home will come back to areas where they currently work.<br/><br/>Of course, this will cause major traffic jams all over Japan.<br/><br/>By the way, it is said that most traffic jams on Japanese highways occur in sag sections, where the slope is changed from a decline to a uprise.<br/><br/>Actually, I also had to come back to Tokyo today.<br/><br/>However, since I really don't like traffic jams, I set off at around 2:30 A.M., and arrived at around 6:30 A.M.<br/><br/>I will go to bed from now until noon.

帰省からの帰還による渋滞<br/><br/>日本で働く多くの社会人にとって、今日でお盆休みは終了します。<br/><br/>すなわち、帰省していた人たちは、皆元居た地域に戻っていきます。<br/><br/>これは当然、全国各地での大渋滞に繋がります。<br/><br/>ちなみに、日本の高速道路での渋滞はサグ部（下り坂から上り坂に変わる場所）で発生するものが大半だそうです。<br/><br/>実は私も今日、東京に戻る必要がありました。<br/><br/>しかし私は渋滞が大嫌いなので、朝2時半頃に出発し、6時半頃に到着しました。<br/><br/>これから昼ごろまで寝ようと思います。
