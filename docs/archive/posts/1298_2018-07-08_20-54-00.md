<p class="correction_comment">Grief is not the right word for this situation.<br/><br/>Meaning #1: grief is the feeling of sadness when someone dies.<br/><br/>Meaning #2: 'to give someone grief' = to trouble/迷惑/痛める.<br/>例：'my wisdom-tooth is giving me grief', 'I got a load of grief from the wife'<br/><br/>You would probably say something like "I was so annoyed with myself".</p>
