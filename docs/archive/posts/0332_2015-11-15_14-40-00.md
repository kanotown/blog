# Ruby and Sapphire
<div class="date">Nov 15, 2015 14:40</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Although I'm not conversant with jewelry, I know ruby and sapphire.Basically, rubies are red, and sapphires are blue.<br/><br/>However, I didn't know the fact that both rubies and sapphires are made of the same ore called 'corundum.'<br/><br/>Corundums have the highest hardness next to diamonds, and their colors change depending on impurities (metal ions).<br/><br/>When chromium is contained as an impurity, the corundum will become red, and the jewel is called ruby.<br/><br/>Also, other corundums that are not changed to red are called sapphires.<br/><br/>Therefore, there are sapphires that the color is yellow, orange, green or pink.

ルビーとサファイア<br/><br/>私は宝石にあまり詳しくありませんが、ルビーとサファイアは知っています。<br/><br/>基本的にルビーは赤色の宝石で、サファイアは青色の宝石です。<br/><br/>しかし、ルビーとサファイアが同じ「コランダム」と呼ばれる同じ鉱石だとは今日まで知りませんでした。<br/><br/>コランダムはダイアモンドに次ぐ硬度を持つ鉱石で、不純物（金属イオン）によってその色が変化します。<br/><br/>不純物としてクロムが混ると赤くなり、ルビーと呼ばれます。<br/><br/>そして赤色以外のコランダムがサファイアと呼ばれます。<br/><br/>このため、黄色やオレンジ、グリーン、ピンクなどの色を持つサファイアが存在します。

Although I'm not conversant with jewelry, I <span class="f_blue">do</span> know ruby and sapphire.
<p class="correction_comment">"Do" is not essential, but "although" sets up a contrast, and so "do" emphasizes the distinction.  A small point: ruby and sapphire are gemstones, but are not yet jewellery until they are "set" within metal.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">"ore" is used for metals before they are reduced: e.g. bauxite is an Aluminum (Al) ore, Galena is a lead (Pb) ore.  Here, I think you want to use the word "material" or "substance."</p>

<li class="corrected correct">
Also, <span class="sline">other</span> corundums that are not changed to red are called sapphires.
<p class="correction_comment">"Other" limits the corundums to which this name change would apply.  You seem to want to mean that all non-red corundums are sapphires.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">"Therefore" is not quite right, because it is used when the following statement follows as a logical or consequence from the previous.  So the statement that "non-red corundums are called sapphires" gives no specific information about the possible colors they could have, except that they are not red.</p>
