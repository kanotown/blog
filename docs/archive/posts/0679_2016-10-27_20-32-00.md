# Bo ni Furu
<div class="date">Oct 27, 2016 20:32</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In the yesterday post, I introduced a phrase "mizu no awa," which means that efforts end in vain.<br/><br/>Today, I'd like to talk about the phrase "bo ni furu," which has the same meaning of "mizu no awa."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "bo ni furu" is "to swing a pole," and it implies that a merchant walks around to sell goods while shouldering a carrying pole with baskets hung at both ends.<br/><br/>Also, such an act or a merchant was referred to as "boteburi" or "furiuri".<br/><br/>In Japan during the Edo period, boteburi have to sell fish and vegetables until the baskets would empty.<br/><br/>Furthermore, even if all goods were sold, the profits were small.<br/><br/>From this fact, "bo ni furu" comes to mean "efforts end in vain."

棒に振る<br/><br/>昨日の投稿では、「努力を無駄にする」ことを表す「水の泡」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>今日は、「水の泡」と同じ意味を持つ「棒に振る」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「棒に振る」は「商品を天秤棒で担いで売り歩く」ということを意味します。<br/><br/>また、その行為やそのような商人のことを「棒手振り」「振売り」等と言います。<br/><br/>江戸時代の日本では、棒手振りによって野菜や魚が売られていました。<br/><br/>棒手振りでは商品がすっかり無くなるまで売ることや、全て売れてもあまり利益が出ないことから、「努力を無駄にする」という意味に転じたそうです。
