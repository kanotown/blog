# Earthquake
<div class="date">May 25, 2015 22:18</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, an earthquake occurred around noon.<br/><br/>It was measured level two on the Japanese intensity scale.<br/><br/>In our laboratory, some said "it's shaking" or "oh, earthquake?" but most of us didn't mind it.<br/><br/>We are accustomed to such a little tremors.<br/><br/>However, I think we can move quickly and appropriately to big tremors, because we have trained for earthquakes since we were in elementary school.
