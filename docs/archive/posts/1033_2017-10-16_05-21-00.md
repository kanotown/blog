# <strong><em>Akinasu wa Yome ni Kuwasuna</strong></em> (秋茄子は嫁に食わすな - Don't Let Daughter-in-Law Eat Autumn Eggplants)
<div class="date">Oct 16, 2017 05:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I introduced the etymology of "nasu" (茄子 - eggplant).<br/><br/>Today I'd like to talk about a Japanese proverb that uses the word, "Aaki-nasu wa yome ni kuwasuna" (秋茄子は嫁に食わすな).<br/><br/>The literal meaning of it is "Don't let daughter-in-law eat autumn eggplants," but there are several interpretations about this.<br/><br/>Commonly, this proverb is often used to mean that autumn eggplants are very delicious, so it should not let hateful daughter-in-law eat them.<br/><br/>In addition, it's sometimes used to mean that daughter-in-law/wife blessed with a baby shouldn't eat eggplants too much because they chill the body, or since autumn eggplants have few seeds, it may become difficult to make a baby (this is a kind of superstition).

<p class="correction_comment">You could say either "your" or "a" in this diary entry. "Your daughter-in-law" sounds like giving advice to the reader. "A daughter-in-law" sounds like a generic discussion about the proverb.</p>
