Have you ever been pretended to be out even though you are actually at home.<br/><br/>In Japanese, such behavior is called "irusu" (居留守) in one word.<br/><br/>This word was born by composing two words, "i" (居 - existence) and "rusu" (留守 - absense).<br/><br/>On the other hand, in English, you seem to have express something like "pretend to be out" or "pretend not to be at home," and I couldn't find a noun that corresponds to irusu.<br/><br/>The reason why there is the noun "irusu" in Japanese might be derived from the fact that Japanese people often use irusu (pretend to be out).

居留守<br/><br/>家に居るのにも関わらず、居ないふりをしたことはありませんか？<br/><br/>日本語では、このことを「居留守」と言います。<br/><br/>一方、英語では "pretend to be out" のように表現する必要があり、居留守に相当する名詞は見つかりませんでした。<br/><br/>日本語に居留守という言葉があるのは、日本人が居留守を使う頻度が高いことに由来するのかもしれません。<br/><br/>私は基本的にインターホンが鳴れば対応していましたが、宗教の勧誘が何度か来てからは、怪しい人に対して居留守を使うようになりました。

 There's no nifty word for it here in the USA. We just have to use one of the long expressions you said.
