<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Japanese people (especially adults) often say "よっこいしょ(yokkoisho)" when they stand up or lift something heavy.<br/><br/>People are able to output their force effectively when they are exhaling or holding their breath.<br/><br/>Therefore, it's natural thing that we put our muscles while calling out some phrases to reduce burdens on our bodies.<br/><br/>In addition to "よっこいしょ," we say "どっこいしょ" and "よっこらせ" and "よっこいしょういち," though those precise etymologies are still unknown.<br/><br/>Note that if you say "よっこいしょういち," you may be questioned like "what era are you from?" because the phrase is very old Japanese joke derived from "横井 庄一（よこい しょういち）" who were a Japanese soldier about a hundred year ago.<br/><br/>By the way, I learned some countries' calling out phrases like "よっこいしょ."<br/><br/>According to the internet, American say "alley-oop," French and Italian say "hop la," German say "hau ruck," and Russian say "Давай(davai)."

 Interesting! I don't think too many English speakers would say 'alley-oop' in the same way as よっこいしょ though. I think it sounds a little childish, haha 😅

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>&gt; I think it sounds a little childish, haha<br/>Oh, it's the reverse of Japan. We don't want to say "よっこいしょ" because it looks old man. Sadly, as we get older, we get less able to stand up without saying "よっこいしょ."
