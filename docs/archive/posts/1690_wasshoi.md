わっしょい<br/><br/>本格的な夏が到来し、各地で祭りが催され始めました。<br/><br/>日本の夏祭りでは、数人～数十人で神輿を担いで街を渡御する行事がよく行われます。<br/><br/>神輿は重たいので、声を掛け合い息を合わせて運ばなければいけません。<br/><br/>このときの掛け声として最も一般的なものは、「わっしょい」です。<br/><br/>「わっしょい」の語源には幾つかの説があります。<br/><br/>一つの有力な説は、「わ」は「平和」、「しょい」は「背負う/背負え」から来ているというものです。

<p class="correction_comment">Google translate returns: One powerful theory <br/><br/>Using "accepted" in a sentence like this is not unexpected, "acceptable" is. Are there unacceptable theories? Google's "powerful" has the same type of feeling powerful vs weak. "Acceptable" does not have that feeling. <br/><br/>Which did you mean? Also, did you see me message?</p>

Thank you for the correction!<br/>That is an interesting question.<br/>The literal meaning of 有力 is indeed "powerful," but when it is used with 理論 (theory), the meaning changes a little. In fact, my dictionary said that 有力な理論 means "the widely accepted theory" or "the most popular/probable/believed theory."<br/>There are other theories, but they are not popular.<br/><br/>&gt; Which did you mean? Also, did you see me message?<br/>Sorry, I will reply to your message later.
