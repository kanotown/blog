Graduation Research Presentation<br/><br/>Today, the first graduation research presentation since I joined the current university was held.<br/><br/>It was also the accomplishment presentation day for the first batch of students in my laboratory.<br/><br/>Each of them has been dedicatedly engaged in their research for a year and has practiced their presentations well, making it a very successful session.<br/><br/>I am really proud of them.<br/><br/>After the presentation, we celebrated a year of our research activities with a small pizza party.<br/><br/>Since there are more events, such as academic conferences, coming up in the near future, all of us cannot take a rest.

卒業研究発表会<br/><br/>今日は、今の大学に着任して初めての卒業研究発表会が行われました。<br/><br/>同時に、私の研究室第一期生の学生たち発表の日でもありました。<br/><br/>それぞれしっかりと１年研究に従事し、しっかりと発表練習をしてきたため、とても良い発表会となりました。<br/><br/>彼らを誇らしく思います。<br/><br/>発表会の後は、１年の研究活動を労い、プチ打ち上げをしました。<br/><br/>入試業務や学会が控えているのでゆっくり休むことはできませんが、大きな山場を一つ越えました。
