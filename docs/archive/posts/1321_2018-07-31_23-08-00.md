# <strong><em>Socha</strong></em> (粗茶 - "Coarse Tea")
<div class="date">Jul 31, 2018 23:08</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Socha</strong></em><br/><br/>In Japan, when serving tea to visitors, we sometimes say "socha desuga" (粗茶ですが).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>so</em></strong> (粗) means "coarse" or "low-grade" and <strong><em>cha</em></strong> (茶) means "tea," socha means "low-grade and coarse tea."<br/><br/>Also, <strong><em>desuga</em></strong> (ですが) is a conjunction that means "but" or "however."<br/><br/>It might be strange for foreigners that we serve tea while explaining that the tea is coarse and low-grade.<br/><br/>Actually, this is a respectful expression peculiar to Japan, which lowers one's own position.<br/><br/>In other words, this expression implies that this tea may be not good compared to tea you drink daily, but I prepared it made with love, so please drink it.

粗茶<br/><br/>日本では、来客にお茶を出す際に「粗茶ですが」と言うことがあります。<br/><br/>「粗」は "coarse" や "low-grade," 「茶」は "tea" を意味するので、「粗茶」は "low-grade and coarse tea" を意味します。<br/><br/>また、「ですが」は "however" を意味する接続詞です。<br/><br/>外国人は、まずいお茶と説明しながら客に飲み物を出すこの文化を変に思うかもしれません。<br/><br/>これは、「粗茶」と言うことで自身を下げ、相手を持ち上げる、日本特有の尊敬表現なのです。<br/><br/>言い換えると、この表現は暗に、「あなたが普段口にするお茶に比べれば粗茶ですが、頑張って煎れましたので飲んでください」ということを意味しています。

<li class="corrected perfect">This sentence is perfect! No correction needed!</li>

<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">Since 'so' (粗) means "coarse" or "low-grade" and 'cha' (茶) means "tea," socha means "low-grade and coarse tea."</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
Since 'so' (粗) means "coarse" or "low-grade" and 'cha' (茶) means "tea," socha means "low-grade <span class="f_blue">or</span> coarse tea."
<p class="correction_comment">Your original sentence is fine, but because you used coarse OR low-grade in the initial description, it should remain coarse or low-grade</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">Also, 'desuga' (ですが) is a conjunction that means "but" or "however."</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
Also, 'desuga' (ですが) is a conjunction that means "but" or "however."
<p class="correction_comment">This sentence is also correct, but using 'in addition' or 'additionally' rather than also sounds more native.</p>

<li class="corrected correct">
Actually, this is a respectful expression peculiar to Japan, which lowers one's own position.
<p class="correction_comment">I like the use of peculiar here. You can also use 'specific'. <br/><br/>The second part of the sentence makes sense, but wouldn't be used in this way in English. Perhaps one could say: ...to Japan, which confers a degree of humility</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">In other words, this expression implies that this tea may be not good compared to tea you drink daily, but I prepared it made with love, so please drink it.</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
In other words, this expression implies that this tea may <span class="f_blue">not be as good as the</span> tea you drink daily, but <span class="f_red"><span class="sline">I prepared</span></span> it <span class="f_blue">is</span> made with love, so please drink it.
<p class="correction_comment">This is ok, but there are other ways of expressing the same thing which might sound more native:<br/><br/>This expression implies that the tea may not be as good as that which the visitor is used to, but that it is prepared with love, and so the visitor is kindly invited to drink it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="comment_small">
 Your English is excellent. Well done!
