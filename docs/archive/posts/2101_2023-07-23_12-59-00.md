# 【No. 2101】A Trial Lesson
<div class="date">Jul 23, 2023 12:59</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A Trial Lesson<br/><br/>Yesterday, my university held an open campus, and I conducted a trial lesson as a teacher.<br/><br/>The content of the lesson was to give high school students hands-on experience in developing web applications.<br/><br/>However, it was difficult to provide each student with a computer for development.<br/><br/>After deep consideration, I decided to create an online source code editor and execution environment that can be used with smartphones and have students use them.<br/><br/>Although there were many concerns, such as the difficulty of writing codes on a smartphone and the load on the server, I could finish the trial lesson without any major trouble.<br/><br/>I thought it would be difficult to write source code on the narrow screen of a smartphone, but the high school students seemed to operate it very easily.

模擬授業<br/><br/>昨日はオープンキャンパスがあり、私はそこで模擬授業を行いました。<br/><br/>内容は、Webアプリケーションの開発を体験してもらうというものです。<br/><br/>しかし、一人一台パソコンは用意できないので、スマートフォンのみを使う必要がありました。<br/><br/>どうするかかなり悩んだ末、スマートフォンで利用可能なオンラインソースコードエディタ、および実行環境を作成し、それを使ってもらうことにしました。<br/><br/>スマートフォンでのコーディング操作の難しさや、サーバにかかる負荷など、不安な要素は多々ありましたが、大きなトラブルはなく無事に終えることができました。<br/><br/>スマートフォンの小さい画面でソースコードを書くのはとても難しいと考えていましたが、高校生達はとても慣れた手付きでサクサク操作しているように見えました。
