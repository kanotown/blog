I've done my statistics homework since fer hours.<br/><br/>It's about t test, and I have to make some sort of null hypothesis which would be rejected.<br/><br/>So now, I'm collecting X-ray CT simulation data as changing parameters of incident X-ray intensity distribution.<br/><br/>I thought there is a significant difference between standard deviation of incident X-ray intensity and quality of reconstruction images (CT images).<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to get results.<br/><br/>It's thrilling. :)
