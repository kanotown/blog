# 【No. 0596】<strong><em>Nekojita</strong></em> (Cat's Tongue)
<div class="date">Aug 5, 2016 23:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "nekojita" (cat's tongue).<br/><br/>Nekojita means people who can't eat hot food/drink.<br/><br/>The etymology is tied to a fact that cats don't prefer to eat hot things.<br/><br/>However, there are no large individual differences in sensitivities of human tongues, and the main cause of nekojita is a usage of tongues.<br/><br/>People who have nekojita feel hot, because they touch hot things on the tip of their tongues that are very sensitive.<br/><br/>On the other hand, people who don't have nekojita touch food/drink on the center of their tongues while placing the tip of tongues on the back side of the teeth.<br/><br/>Therefore, you might overcome nekojita to some extent by changing the way of using your tongues.

猫舌<br/><br/>今日は、猫舌という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>猫舌とは、熱いものを飲食することが苦手な人を指す言葉です。<br/><br/>猫が熱いものを食べようとしないことが由来です。<br/><br/>しかし、人の舌の敏感さに大きな個体差はなく、猫舌の原因は舌の使い方にあるそうです。<br/><br/>猫舌の人は、敏感な舌の先端で飲食物に触れるため、熱いと感じます。<br/><br/>一方、猫舌でない人は舌先を歯の裏側に当て、舌の中央で飲食物に触れます。<br/><br/>食べ方・飲み方を工夫するだけで、ある程度猫舌を克服することができます。

 I used to be nekojita and hated hot drinks as well as soup. Now, however, I think I am the opposite and don't really like cold things. ^^

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>I also hated hot drink when I was child, but I like both hot and cold things now :)<br/>(I don't really like lukewarm drink, haha)
