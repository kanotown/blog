# 【No. 0689】Morning Spiders and Night Spiders
<div class="date">Nov 6, 2016 14:04</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Japan, there is a superstition that is related to spiders like following:<br/><br/>"Let morning spiders get away even if they are your foes, kill night spiders even if they have children."<br/><br/>I was also told something like this superstition when I was child, but I'm not sure the reason.<br/><br/>I found a theory that morning spiders represent visitors and night spiders represent thieves on the Internet, but there is no scientific basis.<br/><br/>In general, house spiders are beneficial insects that eat injurious insects like flies or cockroaches, so I basically don't kill spiders even when I find them at night.

朝蜘蛛と夜蜘蛛<br/><br/>日本には、次のような蜘蛛に関する迷信があります。<br/><br/>「朝の蜘蛛は仇でも逃がせ、夜の蜘蛛は親でも殺せ。」<br/><br/>私もこのように教わったのですが、理由はよくわかりません。<br/><br/>朝の蜘蛛は来客、夜の蜘蛛は泥棒を表しているという説をインターネットで見つけましたが、科学的な根拠はありません。<br/><br/>一般的に蜘蛛は、ハエやゴキブリなどの害虫を食べる益虫であるため、私は基本的に殺しません。

 Well done. I also prefer not to kill spiders, but sometimes I do carry them outside.

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/>If the spider is big, I will also carry it outside, haha.

 This is such an interesting superstition! Maybe the reason is because, if you find a spider during the day, you don't have to worry about being scared because you can see it. But if you find a spider when it's dark, you can't see where it is, and that is so scary you have to kill it?!

 Maybe I just think that because I'm scared of spiders. :)

Ah, I'm sorry. I just read the Japanese version of your post and I changed a word I should not have changed. Please ignore the word "usually" in my correction.<br/><br/>My word "usually" implies that you sometimes kill them but sometimes don't. But you want to say you never kill them, right?<br/><br/>If so, then "... so I don't kill spiders even when I find them at night." is fine. :)

Haha, indeed spiders in dark are scary.<br/>Actually, some people insist that spider species that you can find are not the same at morning and at night, but I'm not sure whether it's correct or not.<br/><br/>&gt; My word "usually" implies that you sometimes kill them but sometimes don't. But you want to say you never kill them, right?<br/><br/>Yes, I don't kill spiders. Thank you for your additional kind explanations (^^)
