<h1 id="subject_show">All The Time（四六時中）</h1>
<div class="date">Jun 30, 2015 14:40</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to introduce a Japanese phrase "四六時中（shi roku ji tyu）."<br/><br/>This means something like "all the time," but if we translate the kanji into English, it will be "in the four-six time."<br/><br/>The reason why "four-six" become "all" is that four times six equals twenty four.<br/><br/>However, in the Edo Period, a day had been divided into twelve term.<br/><br/>For that reason, "四六時中" was "二六時中" at one time.
