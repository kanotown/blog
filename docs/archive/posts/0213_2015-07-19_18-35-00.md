Thank you so much always for correcting my post! :)<br/>Yes, it was too long.<br/><br/>&gt; I chose a key shelf and a wallet as my first 3D printing (models).<br/>Actually, I wanted to say something like "a shelf that can be placed both a key and a wallet (both a key shelf and a wallet shelf)."<br/>If I said "a key/wallet shelf," could this make sense?

&gt;Thank you so much always for correcting my post! :)<br/>You are welcome!<br/>&gt;If I said "a key/wallet shelf," could this make sense?<br/>I think there are some wooden key racks that you can put your wallet on. But if you want to be more specific you can say something like "wall shelf with key hooks/holder".
