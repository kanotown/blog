猫をかぶる<br/><br/>今日は「猫をかぶる」という表現を紹介します。<br/><br/>「猫をかぶる」とは、特定の人の前で本性を隠し、大人しく振る舞うことを表します。<br/><br/>多くの日本人は、この言葉は「猫は一見大人しく見えるが実は獰猛さを隠している」ことに由来すると考えていると思います。<br/><br/>しかし、この言葉の語源にはもう一つの説があります。<br/><br/>わらで編んだむしろは、「ねこだ」とも呼ばれます。<br/><br/>これを被るということは、使い方を知らないふりをしているという説です。

 In English you have the expression "being catty" but it's not exactly the same thing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Also have a look at "being coy".

Thank you so much for correcting my post and letting my know these expressions!<br/>I think that "being coy" is appropriate as the translation of "neko wo kaburu."<br/><br/>&gt; I can't understand this sentence.<br/>Sorry for my bad English.<br/>I wanted to say something like:<br/>A person who is trying to wear a matting looks ridiculous. If there is such a person, people will think that he/her is pretending to be an ignoramus.
