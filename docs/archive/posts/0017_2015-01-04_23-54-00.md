<h1 id="subject_show">I Watched the Movie "Frozen" Dictating Its Serifs</h1>
<div class="date">Jan 4, 2015 23:54</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I watch the movie "Frozen" dictating.<br/><br/>The reason why I chose that title is its serifs might be easy to understand and listen.<br/><br/>After 5 hours when I started, about 3000 words were typed.<br/><br/>The movie progressed just half.<br/><br/>It was more difficult to listen serifs than I thought.<br/><br/>In particular, song parts and Oaken's serifs are difficult for me.<br/><br/>Oaken is a shop owner who speaks with a Scandinavian accent.<br/><br/>Because I was not used to hear it, he's serifs confused me.<br/><br/>Also, interjections are difficult for me to dictate, such as "Whoo", "Yeesh", "Whoa", "Yoo-hoo", etc.<br/><br/>But I never give up, and will keep doing the best that I can.
