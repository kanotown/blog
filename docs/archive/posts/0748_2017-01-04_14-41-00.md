<h1 id="subject_show">元日(Ganjitsu), 元旦(Gantan), 正月(Shogatsu) -- (New Year's Day)</h1>
<div class="date">Jan 4, 2017 14:41</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese words, "ganjitsu", "gantan" and "shogatsu", which are often misunderstood.<br/><br/>"元日 (ganjitsu)" means the first day of the new year, that is January 1st.<br/><br/>"元旦 (gantan)" could mean the first day of the new year, but it usually means "the morning of ganjitsu".<br/><br/>The kanji "旦" in "元旦" expresses that the sun (日) is coming out of the horizon (＿).<br/><br/>"正月 (shogatsu)" means the first month of the new year, that is January.<br/><br/>However, "正月" often means a period for new year's celebration -- it is "三が日 (san ga nichi)" (January 1-3), or "松の内 (matsu no uchi)" (January 1-7).

元日、元旦、正月<br/><br/>今日は、日本人でも間違えやすい「元日」「元旦」「正月」という言葉について説明します。<br/><br/>「元日」は、1年の最初の日、すなわち1月1日を意味します。<br/><br/>「元旦」は1月1日を表すこともありますが、通常は「元日の朝」を意味します。<br/><br/>「元旦」の「旦」という漢字は、太陽が地平線から出てくるようすを表しています。<br/><br/>「正月」は、本来は1年の最初の月、つなわち1月を意味します。<br/><br/>しかし、「正月」は「正月を祝う期間」すなわち「三が日（1月1日～3日まで）」もしくは「松の内（1月1日～7日まで）」を指すことが多いです。
