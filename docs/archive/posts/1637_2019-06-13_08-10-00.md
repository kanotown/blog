<div class="date">Jun 13, 2019 08:10</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Ninin Sankyaku</strong></em><br/><br/>We say <strong><em>ninin sankyaku</em></strong> (二人三脚) to describe that two people sharing the same purpose cooperate.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ni</em></strong> (二) means "two," <strong><em>nin</em></strong> (人) means "person," <strong><em>san</em></strong> (三) means "three," and <strong><em>kyaku</em></strong> (脚) means "leg," so the literal meaning of "ninin sankyaku" is "two people three legs."<br/><br/>This term was originally used to means a race that two participants run while strapping one runner's left leg and another runner's right leg ("three-legged race" in English).<br/><br/>Deriving from it, this term came to have the meaning of cooperating with one another.

二人三脚<br/><br/>誰かと二人で協力して物事に取り組むことを、「二人三脚」と表現することがあります。<br/><br/>「二」は "two"、「人」は "person"、「三」は "three"、「脚」は "leg" を意味するので、「二人三脚」の文字どおりの意味は "two people three legs" です。<br/><br/>この言葉はもともと、二人の隣り合った足首を結び、三本足のようにして走る競技を意味していました。<br/><br/>ここから派生して、二人で足並みを揃えて協力するという意味も持つようになったというわけです。
