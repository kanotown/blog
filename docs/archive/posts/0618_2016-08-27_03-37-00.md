# The Figure of Raindrops
<div class="date">Aug 27, 2016 03:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned figures of raindrops.<br/><br/>I thought that the figure of raindrops while dropping is just a teardrop-shaped, which is something like '💧.'<br/><br/>However, actual raindrops don't have such a shape.<br/><br/>If the diameter of the raindrop is less than 3 mm, it will be an almost perfect sphere.<br/><br/>If the diameter is around 4-5 mm, the bottom of the raindrop will become flat by the air resistance, and it will be similar to a shape of a steamed meat bun.<br/><br/>If the diameter is more than 6 mm, the bottom of the raindrop will be hollowed and a cup-shaped, and eventually split into smaller raindrops.<br/><br/>Since diameters of typical raindrops are around 1 mm, most of shapes of raindrops that we usually see have a sphere shape.

雨粒の形<br/><br/>今日は、雨粒の形について学びました。<br/><br/>私は降っている最中の雨粒は、雫/涙型（💧←このような形）をしていると思っていました。<br/><br/>しかし、雨粒が実際にそのような形になることはありません。<br/><br/>雨粒の直径が 3 mm 以下であると、ほぼ球形になります。<br/><br/>直径が 4-5 mm 程度であると、空気抵抗により底面がつぶれて、肉まんのような形になります。<br/><br/>直径が 6 mm 以上であると、底が凹んでおわんのようになり、やがて分裂して小さな雨粒になります。<br/><br/>一般的な雨の雨粒は 1 mm 前後なので、我々が見ている雨はほぼ全て球形をしていることになります。

"Since diameters of typical raindrops are around 1 mm, most of shapes of raindrops that we usually see have a sphere shape."<br/><br/>Oops, I didn't mean to say that this sentence was perfect. The other person's correction is good.<br/><br/>Anyway, you're welcome ^.^
