私はよく "express" と "represent" を間違えます。<br/><br/>その理由は、これらの単語はどちらも日本語で "表す" と訳すことができるからです。<br/><br/>そのため、今日はこの二つの違いについて調べました。<br/><br/>Cambridge Dictionaries Online によると、"express" は "言葉や行動によって、あなたの考えや感情を示すこと" とありました。<br/><br/>また、"represent" は "何かのサインやシンボルを表すこと" とありました。<br/><br/>"表す" を英語に訳すとき、何かを考えている生き物が主語なら "express," 物が主語なら "represent" を使うと良いのかもしれません。<br/><br/>試しに幾つか例文を作ってみました。<br/><br/>日本人はよく、"express" と "represent" を一つの日本語で表す。<br/>Japanese people often express the words "express" and "represent" with one Japanese word.<br/><br/>その辞書に載っている絵は、"express" と "represent" の違いを表している。<br/>The picture on the dictionary represents the difference between "express" and "represent."<br/>

<p class="correction_comment">It's not that the sentence was incorrect; this is just how I would write it.  When I see "nominative", I think of "nominative case" 「主格」.  On the other hand, I would translate 「主語」 to "subject".</p>

 I think this is a good "rule of thumb" for translating 「表す」.  Great job!
