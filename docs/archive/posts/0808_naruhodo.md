なるほど<br/><br/>今日は「なるほど」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「なるほど」は、相手の意見に同意したり、納得したりする際に用いる言葉です。<br/><br/>「なるほど」の「なる」は「出来る」、「ほど」は「限界」を意味し、「なるほど」はもともと「できる限り」という意味を持っていました。<br/><br/>これが「明らか」という意味を持つようになり、現在の「確かに」という意味を持つようになったと考えられています。<br/><br/>ちなみに、インターネットのスラング（ジョーク）に、「なるほど、わからん」というものがあります。<br/><br/>丁寧に説明がなされているものの、用語や言い回しが難解すぎて意味が理解できない際に使われます。
