Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese phrase "tsumaranai," which means "boring."<br/><br/>"Tsumaranai" is composed of the verb "tsumaru" and the negative auxiliary verb "-nai."<br/><br/>"Tsumaru" has several meanings, such as "choke," "jam," "get stuck," and "be settled."<br/><br/>However, "tsumaranai" has the meanings of "boring" and "silly," which were derived from "be not settled."<br/><br/>Note that if you say "tsumaru," it will never mean something like "interesting," which is an antonym of "boring."<br/><br/>There is the similar phrase "kudaranai," which means "boring," but the meaning will never become "interesting," even if you remove the negative auxiliary verb "-nai" and say "kudaaru."

つまらない<br/><br/>今日は、日本語の「つまらない」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「つまらない」は動詞「詰まる」と、否定の助動詞「ない」で構成されています。<br/><br/>「詰まる」は、"choke," "jam," "get stuck," そして "be settled" など、さまざまな意味を持っています。<br/><br/>しかし、「つまらない」は "be not settled" から転じて、"boring" や "silly" という意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>「詰まる」と言っても、"boring" の反意語である "interesting" という意味には決してならないことに注意して下さい。<br/><br/>同様に、"boring" を意味する言葉として「くだらない」がありますが、"下る" と言っても "interesting" の意味にはなりません。
