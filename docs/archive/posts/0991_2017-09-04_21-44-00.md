# 【No. 0991】<strong><em>Shinsetsu</strong></em> (親切 - Kindness)
<div class="date">Sep 4, 2017 21:44</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
It is very important to be "shinsetsu" (親切).<br/><br/>"Shinsetsu" is a word that represents kindness and compassion toward other people.<br/><br/>Generally, the "shin" (親) means "parents," the "setsu" means "cut," but it doesn't mean to cut parents.<br/><br/>The kanji "親" (shin) means not only "parents," but also "being familiar."<br/><br/>Also, the kanji "切" (setsu) can mean to fit well or reach, because if you want to cut something using a knife or something, the knife will touch the object.<br/><br/>That is to say, "shinsetsu" implies that you become familiar with someone and reach his/her heart.

親切<br/><br/>「親切」であることは、とても大事なことです。<br/><br/>「親切」とは、思いやりがあり、人のためにつくすさまを表した言葉です。<br/><br/>一般的に「親」は "parents," 「切」は "cut" を意味しますが、決して親を切るという意味ではありません。<br/><br/>「親」という漢字は、「両親」の他にも「身近であること」を意味します。<br/><br/>また、「切」という漢字は、何か刃物をじかに当てることから、「ぴったり合う」「行き届く」なども意味も持ちます。<br/><br/>すなわち親切とは、誰かの近くに寄り添って、行き届くようにするということです。

It's just that "the word" would indicate more clearly that you're referring to 「親切」, rather than 「親」or「切」. For your consideration.
