# 【No. 0868】<strong><em>Neko no Me</strong></em> (Cat's Eyes)
<div class="date">May 4, 2017 09:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese idiom "neko no me."<br/><br/>"Neko" means "cat" and "me" means "eyes," so "neko no me" can literally mean "cat's eyes," but it is also used to mean that things change at a bewildering pace.<br/><br/>This meaning was derived from the fact that shapes and sizes of cats' eyes change drastically -- they become rounded or thinned depending on the surrounding brightness.<br/><br/>Pupils of cats can grow about three times larger than ones of people, and the sensitivity to light is more than six times.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are a layer called "tapetum" on back sides of cats' retinae.<br/><br/>Since "tapetum" reflects light, cats can sense light twice with their retinae.<br/><br/>Therefore, as long as there is a little light, cats can see things in the dark.

猫の目<br/><br/>今日は「猫の目」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「猫の目」は、文字通り猫の目を意味することもありますが、物事がめまぐるしく変化することのたとえとしても用いられます。<br/><br/>この言葉は、猫の目が周囲の明るさによって丸くなったり細くなったり、形や大きさが激しく変化することに由来します。<br/><br/>猫の瞳孔は、人間の約3倍ほど大きくなることができ、光の感度は6倍以上になります。<br/><br/>さらに、猫の網膜の裏側にある「タペタム」という層で光を反射し、反射させた光をもう一度網膜で感知します。<br/><br/>このため、わずかな光さえあれば、猫は暗闇でもはっきりとものを見ることができます。
