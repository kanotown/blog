# 【No. 2113】<strong><em>Surume Gē</strong></em> (スルメゲー)
<div class="date">Aug 4, 2023 20:56</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Surume Gē</strong></em><br/><br/>Recently, I came across the term <strong><em>surume gē</em></strong> (スルメゲー).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>surume</em></strong> (スルメ) means "dried squid," and <em>gē</em> is an abbreviation for <strong><em>gēmu</em></strong> (ゲーム - meaning "game"), the literal meaning of <em>surume ge</em> is "dried squid game."<br/><br/>It does not mean a game where you manipulate dried squid.<br/><br/>Just like dried squid, which tastes better the more you chew it, <em>surume gē</em> refers to an attractive game that becomes more fun the more you play it, even if it is not fun at first.<br/><br/>Similarly, a song that becomes more appealing the more you listen to it is called <strong><em>surume kyoku</em></strong> (スルメ曲 - literally means "dried squid song").

スルメゲー<br/><br/>最近、「スルメゲー」という言葉を知りました。<br/><br/>「スルメ」は "dried squid"、「ゲー」は "game" を意味する「ゲーム」の略であるため、「スルメゲー」の文字どおりの意味は "dried squid game" となります。<br/><br/>「スルメが出てくるゲーム」というわけではありません。<br/><br/>「噛めば噛むほど味が出て美味しいスルメ」のように、「（最初はいまいちでも）プレイすればするほど面白さが増してくる、長く楽しめる魅力的なゲーム」というわけです。<br/><br/>同様に、聞けば聞くほど良さがわかってくるような曲は、「スルメ曲」のように呼ばれます。
