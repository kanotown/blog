おふくろ<br/><br/>日本では、母親の呼び方が何通りかあります。<br/><br/>最も多いのは、「お母さん」「母さん」です。<br/><br/>最近では、「ママ」という呼び方も増えてきました。<br/><br/>子供の頃、発音のしやすさから「お母さん」「お父さん」の代わりに「ママ」「パパ」と呼ばせる家庭が増え、それが定着したものと思われます。<br/><br/>一方、「おふくろ」という呼び方も存在します。<br/><br/>語源としては、かつて母親は家庭の財産を袋に入れて管理していたからという説や、我々は母親のふところで育つからという説などがあります。<br/><br/>「おふくろ」という呼び方はかっこいいと思いますが、私は「お母さん」から「おふくろ」に切り替えるタイミングを逃しました。

 Great work! Very interesting that mama and papa are becoming more popular! The part about the expression "ofukoro" is also very interesting, thanks for sharing the theories surrounding it! Very clearly written, except for the two parts that I commented on, but they were very close! :)

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>I'm glad to hear you say that :)<br/><br/>&gt; I'm not sure exactly what you intended to say, but hopefully I got close. It seemed like you were trying to say that one term ("futokoro" or "okaasan") came before the other, but I could be wrong :)<br/><br/>Sorry for my confusing sentnece.<br/>First, I made a big mistake. In this sentence, I had to say the word "ofukuro" instead of "futokoro."<br/><br/>And I wanted to say something like:<br/>I think that the saying "ofukuro" is cool.<br/>As children, most of us address our mothers by "okaasan" or "mama."<br/>At some point, such as an age of puberty or a rebellious phase, some people come to address our mothers by "ofukuro" instead of "okaasan."<br/>(I think that people who use "mama" will never come to use "ofukuro.")<br/>I missed the transition timing, so I will use "okaasan" forever.

I think that the saying "ofukuro" is cool, but I missed when people switched from "okaasan" to "futokoro."

I think that the saying "ofukuro" is cool, but when I got older, I never switched to "futokoro" from "okaasan."

 Interesting origin of this word.  I thought it was going to be related to owls.

I'll have to think twice about whether a person means "mother" or "owl" when I hear this word.
