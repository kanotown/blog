餅肌<br/><br/>私は最近、肌が荒れています。<br/><br/>そのため、私は「餅肌」の人がうらやましいです。<br/><br/>「餅」は "rice cake," 「肌」は "skin" を意味するので、「餅肌」の文字通りの意味は "rice cake skins" や "skins like a rice cake" になります。<br/><br/>つきたての餅は、きめ細かく、なめらかで、弾力があり、白く美しいです。<br/><br/>すなわち「餅肌」とは、そのような美しい肌を指した褒め言葉です。<br/><br/>英語では「ベルベット」の質感から、"velvety skin" と表現することがあります。
