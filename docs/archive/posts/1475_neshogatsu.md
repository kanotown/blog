寝正月<br/><br/>あけましておめでとうございます。<br/><br/>今年は「寝正月」をしました。<br/><br/>「寝」は "sleep"、「正月」は "New Year's holiday" を意味するので、「寝正月」の文字どおりの意味は "sleeping during the New Year's holiday" となります。<br/><br/>実際の意味は、正月の休みを外出せず、家でゆっくり過ごすことです。<br/><br/>日本では伝統的に、12月31日から1月1日にかけて眠らずに年神様を迎え、1月1日はゆっくり寝て過ごす風習がありました。<br/><br/>そのため、初売りや正月行事は2日から行われることが多いです。
