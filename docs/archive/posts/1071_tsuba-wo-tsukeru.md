There is a Japanese idiom, "tsuba wo tsukeru" (唾をつける).<br/><br/>The "tsuba" (唾) means "spit" and the "tsukeru" (つける) means "to put on," so the literal meaning of the combination is "to put your spit on something."<br/><br/>Originally this idiom was mainly used for food.<br/><br/>Just imagine - you don't want to eat food wet with someone's spit, do you?<br/><br/>Therefore, "tsuba wo tsukeru" means to do something in advance in order to prevent other people from getting what you want.<br/><br/>Incidentally, if you add "mayuni" (眉に - on your eyebrow) and say "mayuni tsuba wo tsukeru" (or "mayutsuba" for short), the meaning will differ substantially from this idiom.<br/><br/>You can check the meaning of "mayutsuba" on the following URL.<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/35103209355274424265303829210995655726" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/35103209355274424265303829210995655726</a>

唾をつける<br/><br/>日本語には、「唾をつける」という慣用句があります。<br/><br/>「唾」は "spit," 「つける」は "to put on" を意味するので、「唾をつける」の文字通りの意味は "to put your spit on" です。<br/><br/>もともとこの言葉は、主に食べ物に対して使われていたようです。<br/><br/>誰かの唾がつけられた食べ物は、食べたくありませんよね。<br/><br/>つまり「唾をつける」とは、欲しいものを他の人にとられないように、前もって手を打つことを意味します。<br/><br/>ちなみに、頭に「眉に」をつけて「眉に唾を付ける」（もしくは略して「眉唾」）と言うと、意味が大きく異なるので注意して下さい。<br/>（「眉唾」の意味は下記URLを参照）

 You have amazing English!  There were only very small errors - some of which I feel even native English users might make - and the flow seems to be very natural.  Thanks for the interesting and educational post!
