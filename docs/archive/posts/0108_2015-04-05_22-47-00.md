# 【No. 0108】Important to me or important for me
<div class="date">Apr 5, 2015 22:47</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I heard a phrase like "that is important to me," in a US drama.<br/><br/>I often use the phrase "important for me," but have never used the phrase "important to me," so I searched them.<br/><br/>As a result, I found the following things:<br/><br/>・In the case of using a sense subject like "it is important for me to...," we must use "for me."<br/><br/>・In the case like "this is important to me," we usually use "to me."<br/><br/>・In the case like "you are important for/to my life," for specific purposes, we can use both "for" and "to." <br/><br/>However, the nuances might differ.<br/><br/>Also, I found sentences such as the followings:<br/><br/>It is important to you for me to become a doctor.<br/>It is important to me for you to become a doctor.<br/><br/>When I see these sentences suddenly, I would be thrown into utter chaos. Haha.

私はアメリカのドラマで、"That is important to me." のようなフレーズを聞きました。<br/><br/>私は、"important for me" というフレーズをよく使用しますが、"important to me" とどう違うのか気になったので、調べました。<br/><br/>その結果、次のことがわかりました。<br/><br/>・"It is important for me to..." のような意味上の主語が使われる場合は、必ず "for me" を使う。<br/><br/>・"This is important to me." のような場合は、通常 "to me" を使う。<br/><br/>・"You are important for/to my life." のように、具体的な目的に対しては "for" でも "to" でも構わない。<br/><br/>しかし、ニュアンスは若干異なるかもしれない。<br/><br/>また、私が調べたサイトでは、次のような例文も書かれていました。<br/><br/>It is important to you for me to become a doctor.<br/>It is important to me for you to become a doctor.<br/><br/>突然この分を見たら、混乱してしまいそうです。(笑)

 Interesting! I've never thought about these phrases causing confusion, but now that you put it this way, it makes sense.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Usually, "important for you to...." has a more logical/pragmatic connotation. E.g. It's important for you to eat well. -&gt; You should eat well. It's important for you to do well in school. -&gt; You should do well in school. I like to think of "important for" to do with the future.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Important to me" has a more personal meaning. E.g. It's important to me that you eat well. -&gt; I want you to eat well. It has more to do with how you feel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 You can translate "Important to me" as "I want you to" in a more personal and intimate way. You can translate "Important for me" as "I should" in a practical way.

Thank you very much for correcting me! :)<br/>I learned something new! I didn't know these nuances and connotations.<br/>In the future, I'd like to be able to understand the difference between "to" and "for" in a instinctive way. Because I found many other problems such as "difficult for/to me," or "interesting for/to me," etc.

Typically "to me" can roughly be translated to "in my opinion." "For me" is more action oriented and is usually with regards to the future.<br/><br/>Let's look at "difficult to/for":<br/>That math problem looks difficult to me. -&gt; In my opinion, that math problem is difficult.<br/>It's difficult for me to lift that box. -&gt; Describes the difficulty in a predicted action (lifting the box).<br/>Usually "for me" takes the form:<br/>It's difficult for me to (action verb). <br/>More examples: It's difficult for me to understand how you are feeling. It's difficult for me to switch off the lights before I sleep.<br/><br/>It's very similar with interesting to/for (or any to/for adjective).<br/>That story is interesting to me. -&gt; In my opinion, that story is interesting.<br/>It's not common to use "interesting for me," but the convention would be the same. For example: It'll be interesting for me to see how my boyfriend acts around his parents. Once again, there is a predicted action verb "to see" that is being described as interesting.<br/>It is more common to omit the "for me," however.<br/><br/>This was a little long but I hope it helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
