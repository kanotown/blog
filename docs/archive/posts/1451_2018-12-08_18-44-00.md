出不精<br/><br/>私は最近、「出不精」の性質が現れてきたかもしれません。<br/><br/>「出不精」とは、外出するのを面倒くさがり、ずっと家にいることや、そのような性質を持つ人のことを指す言葉です。<br/><br/>「出」は "to go out"、「不」は否定語、そして「精」は "spirit" を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち「出不精」とは、「外出をしたがらない精神」というわけです。<br/><br/>太っている人を指す差別用語「デブ」は、「出不精」から来たという説もありますが、定かではありません。

<p class="correction_comment">"I have begun to have" sounds unnatural. Instead of saying "I've begun to have," you should say "I've been having." <br/>"Property" is not appropriate for this sentence because it sounds like you're saying 財産</p>
