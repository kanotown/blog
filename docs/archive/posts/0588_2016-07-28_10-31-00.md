100回のしゃっくり<br/><br/>日本には、しゃっくりが100回出ると死ぬ、という迷信があります。<br/><br/>私は子供の頃死ぬのが怖くて、しゃっくりが出始めたら回数を数えていました。<br/><br/>しかし、大抵10回くらいから数えるのを忘れ、いつの間にかしゃっくりも止まっていることがほとんどです。<br/><br/>そして、仮にしゃっくりが100回出ても、死ぬことはありません。<br/><br/>アメリカ人のオズボーン氏は、約68年間しゃっくりをし続けたとして、ギネスに登録されています。<br/><br/>しゃっくりをしながら、2度の結婚をして、8人の子どもに恵まれました。<br/><br/>彼が生涯でしたしゃっくりの回数は、4億3千万以上だと推定されています。
