<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Wi-Fi is a technology that connects to wireless networks.<br/><br/>It is sometimes said that this word is derived from wireless fidelity, but this story is wrong.<br/><br/>Actually, Wi-Fi is derived from Hi-Fi (High Fidelity : this means audio devices), and "Wi" didn't have any meaning.<br/><br/>It is just rhymed.<br/><br/>The meaning "wireless fidelity" was given later.<br/>
