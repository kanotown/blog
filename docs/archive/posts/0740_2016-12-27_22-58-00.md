へそくり<br/><br/>今日は、「へそくり」という単語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「へそくり」は、倹約などをして内密に蓄えたお金のことを表します。<br/><br/>ここで、「へそ（綜麻）」は「麻糸を巻きつけた糸巻き」のことで、「繰る」は「糸を巻き取ること」すなわち「糸巻きをつくること」を意味します。<br/><br/>かつて、「綜麻を繰る」仕事は、貧しい暮らしを支える主婦の内職でした。<br/><br/>この仕事で蓄えることができるわずかなお金を「へそくりがね」と言い、それが略されて「へそくり」になったとされています。<br/><br/>ちなみに、英語では "a stash of money" や "secret money", "mad money" などと言うようです。
