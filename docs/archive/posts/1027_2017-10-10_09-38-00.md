赤身魚と白身魚<br/><br/>日本では、魚はよく赤身魚と白身魚に分類されます。<br/>（厳密には、身に含まれるヘモグロビンかミオグロビンの量で分類されます。）<br/><br/>赤身魚は身が赤い魚のことで、味が濃く、脂質や鉄分を多く含みます。<br/><br/>例えば、アジやサバ、サンマ、カツオなどです。<br/><br/>一方、白身魚は身が白い魚のことで、味は淡白ですが、低脂質高タンパクであり、消化にも良いです。<br/><br/>例えば、タイやヒラメ、フグ、サケなどです。<br/><br/>サケの身は赤みがかっているため赤身魚と勘違いされることもありますが、これは赤い色素を含むプランクトン「オキアミ」を餌としているためです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、サバやサンマなど、背の部分が青い魚のことを「青魚」と言います。
