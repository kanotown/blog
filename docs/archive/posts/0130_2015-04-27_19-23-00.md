Today, I woke up at 5:00 a.m., and I climbed a hill riding my road bike.<br/><br/>I patiently climbed 30 km, and took a little rest when I arrived to the top of the mountain, and descended 30 km. <br/><br/>Although roads that lead to the top were concreted, it was really hard to climb because the roads had some steep slopes.<br/><br/>However, there was not a single cloud in the blue sky, so I felt so good.

今日は朝5時に置きて、ロードバイクで山を登りに行きました。<br/><br/>ひたすら30km坂を登って、山頂についたら一休みし、ひたすら30km下りました。<br/><br/>コンクリートで舗装された道でしたが、急勾配もあったため、なかなか大変でした。<br/><br/>しかし、今日は雲ひとつ無い快晴で、とても気持ちよかったです。<br/><br/>

 Very well written! And what a nice adventure. I'd love to do that sometime, but waking up at 5 am definitely takes a lot of motivation, haha... :')

Thank you so much for correcting me! I'm glad about your words. :)<br/>Haha, it sounds difficult to wake up early in the morning indeed, but I think it is really good for cyclist because there are almost no cars on the roads.

 自転車をこぐことはいいですね。私が住んでいる場所は丘もあります。

Thank you for your comment!<br/>丘があるのは素敵ですよね！<br/>私は自転車に乗るのが好きですが、特に丘を登るのが好きです。<br/>頂上まで登り切ったときは、達成感があって、とても気分が良いです。:)
