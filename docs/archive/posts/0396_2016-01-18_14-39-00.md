Today the snow piled up high after a long interval.<br/><br/>It was scared for me to drive a snowy road as ever.<br/><br/>However, since I felt that it was warmer than usual, I searched for the reason.<br/><br/>When the snow falls, the height of cloud become low, and radiative cooling is suppressed.<br/><br/>Also, when the snow is piled up, the effect of solar radiation reflected from snow surfaces becomes large, and it could make us feel warm.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if a condition that wind is calm is added, we seem to feel the snow day as a warm day.

暖かい雪の日<br/><br/>今日は久しぶりに雪が積もりました。<br/><br/>雪道を運転するのは相変わらず怖かったです。<br/><br/>しかしいつもよりも暖かく感じましたので、その理由を調べてみました。<br/><br/>雪が降ると雲の位置が低く、放射冷却が起こりにくくなります。<br/><br/>また、雪が積もっていると雪面反射の影響が大きく、暖かく感じるそうです。<br/><br/>さらに、風が強くないという条件が加われば、雪の日を暖かく感じるようです。

 ニュースで雪祭りのための詰まった雪は今年下がったそうだと読んでいました。でも、雪がふったから、その問題はもう解けるでしょうね。(I guess this solves the problem) :)
