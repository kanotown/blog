# 【No. 1218】<strong><em>Tsuratan</em></strong> (つらたん - Painful)
<div class="date">Apr 19, 2018 23:09</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Tsuratan</em></strong><br/><br/>I would like to say "tsuratan" (つらたん) now.<br/><br/>"Tsuratan" is an Internet slang term used by mainly young people, and it represents a bad/painful feeling.<br/><br/>The "tsura" (つら) of "tsuratan" comes from the Japanese verb "tsurai" (辛い), which means "painful" or "tough," but the "tan" (たん) has no meaning.<br/><br/>It is said that young people added "tan" just because it sounds cute.<br/><br/>This term ranked as the first on "Gyaru Ryukogo Taisho" (ギャル流行語大賞 - Girls' Keywords-of-the-Year contest) in 2012. However, I'm not sure how often it is used among young people currently.

つらたん<br/><br/>私は今、「つらたん」とつぶやきたいです。<br/><br/>「つらたん」は主に若者が使うネットスラングで、辛い気分を表すときに使います。<br/><br/>「つらたん」の「つら」は、「辛い」から来ていますが、「たん」に意味はありません。<br/><br/>若者は、「なんとなく響きがかわいいから」「語感がいいから」という理由で「たん」がつけられました。<br/><br/>この言葉は、2012年の「ギャル流行語大賞」で1位に選ばれましたが、現在どれだけ若者の間で使われているか、私にはよくわかりません。

<p class="correction_comment">Your sentence has no errors in it, but I'm guessing you meant something a little bit different for the beginning part of it. Saying "I would like to say" just means you want to say that word (probably out loud). I think you intended something like this:<br/>"I would like to tell you about"<br/>"I would like to talk about"</p>

Thank you so much for the correction and comment!<br/><br/>&gt; Saying "I would like to say" just means you want to say that word (probably out loud). <br/>To tell you the truth, I'm being trapped inside my university (gates for cars are closed and I can't go home), so literally I want to say "tsuratan" now, haha.

I see! So what you probably want to say is "I feel like saying tsuratan right now". The most normal way I can imagine hearing someone say this is "I really feel like saying tsuratan right now." (Actually the most normal way would just be to say the word rather than declaring that you want to say the word.)
