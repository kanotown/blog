あくび<br/><br/>眠たいときや、退屈なとき、我々は反射的に「あくび」をします。<br/><br/>「あくび」とは、口を大きく開いて深く息を吸い、短く吐く呼吸動作のことです。<br/><br/>日本語の「あくび」は古語に由来すると考えられており、「あくびをすること」を意味する「欠くぶ」の名詞形、もしくは「飽きる」ことを意味する「飽くぶ」の名詞形であるという説が有力です。<br/><br/>漢字では「欠伸」と書かれることが多いですが、「欠」と書くこともあります。<br/><br/>「欠」という漢字は、人が大きく口を開けているさまをかたどった象形文字で、この字だけで「あくび」の意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>「伸」は背伸びをすることを意味した漢字であるため、「欠伸」という漢字は「背伸びをして欠伸をするさま」を示唆しています。

 Interesting.  When I saw 欠, I thought of “lacking” in English.  I didn’t know it was associated with yawning.  Thank you!

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>Indeed, most terms containing 欠 mean "lacking." By the way, 欠 as a radical is called "akubi." By the way, 欠 as a radical is called "akubi." For example, it is a radical of 歌, 次, and 欺.
