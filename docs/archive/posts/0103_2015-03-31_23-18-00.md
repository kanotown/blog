ハッカーとクラッカー<br/><br/>今日は大学で、ネットワークが繋がりませんでした。<br/><br/>原因は不明でしたが、ほぼ一日中使えなかったため、とても不便でした。<br/><br/>何者かによる攻撃を受けたのかもしれません。<br/><br/>私たちは（もしかしたら日本人だけかもしれません）よく、ネットワークシステムなどを攻撃する人をハッカーと呼びますが、これは正しくはありません。<br/><br/>ハッカーはコンピュータやネットワークに関する深い技術的知識を持ち、その知識を活用してシステムの改善や課題の解決をする人たちのことを指します。<br/><br/>すなわち、ハッカーとは良い人なのです。<br/><br/>ハッカーは、コンピュータの内側を覗く人も指しますが、不正アクセスや破壊・改ざんなどの違法行為を伴う場合は、クラッカーと呼びます。<br/><br/>しかしハッカーとクラッカーは混同されることがあるため、善意的なハッカーをホワイトハットハッカー、クラッカーをブラックハットハッカーと呼ぶこともあります。<br/><br/>また、特に優れたハッカーは、ウィザードやグルと呼ばれます。<br/><br/>私は時々Javaをハッキングしますが、決して悪人ではありません。

 I think that the distinction between hacker and cracker is not known here in the West either. Hacker usually has a negative connotation here as well. This was an interesting read!

Maybe I had a mistake. "the information of West" → "the information of the West."

 Great job, kanotown-san!
 <br/>
 Like nanacc said, "hacker" does have a negative connotation in the West.  I don't think the term "cracker" is used much in the US--at least, I don't hear it much, and I'm a computer security guy.  We do use "white hat" and "black hat" often, though.

Thank you so much for correcting me! :)<br/>Actually, most Japanese don't know the term "cracker," "white hat" and "black hat." We completely mix up "white hat hacker" and "black hat hacker." I heard that bad guys had introduced themselves to people as "hacker," and the negative meaning has widely spread.
