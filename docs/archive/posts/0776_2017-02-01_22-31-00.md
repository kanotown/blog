# <strong><em>Iro-otoko</strong></em> (A Good-looking Man)
<div class="date">Feb 1, 2017 22:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese word "iro-otoko."<br/><br/>"Iro-otoko" means a good-looking man, a lascivious man or a man who is popular with women.<br/><br/>Since "iro" means "lascivious" (also means "color") and "otoko" means "man,"  "iro-otoko" originally meant only a womanizer.<br/><br/>During the Edo period, it came to mean a good-looking man and a popular man.<br/><br/>It is thought that such a change of meanings is derived from Kabuki.<br/><br/>In Kabuki, an actor who played a love scene as a role of a beautiful man (called "nuregotoshi") had his face painted white.<br/><br/>From this fact, "nuregotoshi" came to be called "iro-otoko," then came to have the above meanings.

色男<br/><br/>今日は、「色男」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「色男」は、顔立ちが良い美男子や、女性にもてる男、好色な男を表す言葉です。<br/><br/>「色」は「好色」であることを意味するため、もともと「色男」は女遊びが好きな男性を指す言葉でした。<br/><br/>そして江戸時代の頃には、美男子や、女性にもてる男を指すようになりました。<br/><br/>このような意味の変化は、歌舞伎に由来すると考えられています。<br/><br/>歌舞伎において、濡れ場を演じる男の役者（濡事師）は、色白の美男子に見せるために顔を白く塗っていました。<br/><br/>このことから、「濡事師」は「色男」と呼ばれるようになり、現在の意味を持つようになったそうです。

 Really great English! Logical, clear, articulate.

 However, this sounds very formal, like a professor.
