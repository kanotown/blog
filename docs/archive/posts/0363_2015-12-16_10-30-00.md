# 【No. 0363】<strong><em>Boring things</strong></em> (Tsumaranai mono)
<div class="date">Dec 16, 2015 10:30</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There is a Japanese traditional expression "tsumaranai mono desuga (which means something like 'this is a boring thing')."<br/><br/>We would say this phrase when we brought someone something (presents).<br/><br/>You might think "to give someone gift with such a bad word is strange."<br/><br/>Actually, this phrase implies something like "I chose this present wholeheartedly, but it could be a boring thing for splendid people like you."<br/><br/>I mean, this phrase is a kind of Japanesey honorific expressions.<br/><br/>However, some people oppose to use this phrase because it's difficult to carry the nuance to recent generations.<br/><br/>By the way, my dictionary translate this phrase into "Here's a little something for you."

つまらないもの<br/><br/>日本の伝統的な表現に、「つまらないものですが」というものがあります。<br/><br/>これは、相手に手土産などを贈る際に言う言葉です。<br/><br/>「つまらないもの」と言いつつ贈り物をするなんて変に感じるかもしれません。<br/><br/>しかしこの言葉は、「あなたのような立派な人間の前ではつまらないものになってしまうかもしれませんが、一生懸命選びました」のようなことを暗に意味しています。<br/><br/>つまり、相手を立てて自分を下げる、敬語のような表現なのです。<br/><br/>しかしながら、最近ではこのニュアンスが伝わりにくいということで、この表現に反対する人もいます。<br/><br/>ちなみに、辞書には「Here's a little something for you」のように訳されています。
