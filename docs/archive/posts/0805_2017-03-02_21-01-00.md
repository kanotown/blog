<div class="date">Mar 2, 2017 21:01</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the slang term "butsu."<br/><br/>"Butsu" is one of pronunciations of "物," which means "things," and it is used as a pronoun to indicate some kind of things literally<br/><br/>When you want to refer to general things, "物" is read as "mono," but if you read it as "butsu" in on-yomi (Chinese readings), it will mean "antisocial things" or "illegal things" in most cases.<br/><br/>For example, there are drugs, stimulants, guns, and etc. as subjects that are called "butsu."<br/><br/>Also, "薬," which means drugs or medicine, is usually read as "kusuri," but if you read it as "yaku" in on-yomi, it will especially mean illicit drugs or stimulants.

ブツ<br/><br/>今日は「ブツ」という俗語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ブツ」は「物」の音読みで、字のとおり、何らかの物品を表す代名詞として用いられます。<br/><br/>一般的な物を指す場合は「物」を「もの」と読みますが、「反社会的な物品」や「違法性のある物品」を指す場合は「ブツ」と読むことが多いです。<br/><br/>「ブツ」と呼ぶ対象としては、麻薬や覚醒剤、拳銃などがあります。<br/><br/>また、「薬（くすり）」を「ヤク」と音読みすると、薬の中でも特に麻薬や覚醒剤を指すことが多いです。
