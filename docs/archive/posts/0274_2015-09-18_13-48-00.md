Have you ever had the experience of being tempted to watch something by being told "don't watch it?"<br/><br/>This psychological effect, that you feel tempted to something by being prohibited like this, is called "Caligula Effect."<br/><br/>Since most people place more value on rare things, if something is prohibited or restricted, it will tend to get a lot of attention.<br/><br/>Therefore, if someone say "no trespassing," "don't touch," or "don't tell anyone," some people will get eager to do the opposite to them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are exceptions.<br/><br/>Even if you say "don't study hard" to your children, they will not study.

カリギュラ効果<br/><br/>「見ないで」と言われると、かえって見たくなったという経験はありませんか？<br/><br/>このように何かを禁止されると、余計にそれをやってみたくなる心理的作用のことを、カリギュラ効果と言います。<br/><br/>人は希少性のあるものに価値を置きやすいので、何かが禁止されたり制限されると、それに執着しやすくなります。<br/><br/>そのため、「立入禁止」や「触るな」、「誰にも言うな」などを言われると、その反対のことをしたくなるそうです。<br/><br/>残念ながら、例外もあります。<br/><br/>子供たちに「勉強するな」と言っても、勉強はしないでしょう。
