# 【No. 0077】Connective Words
<div class="date">Mar 5, 2015 20:52</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Today, I learned that there are a lot of "therefore" in sentences which Japanese wrote and it should not be in heavy usage. Also I learned that we must not use "therefore" with comma at the beginning of sentences. Hehehe, I have made great use of the word ever. Similarly, I think we use far too many connective words such as "so, however, as a result."  If we write sentences using many connective words, the sentences would give us the illusion that it's logical despite non-logical. This is really dangerous. In some English-speaking school, students train to enhance their mental capacity and prevent a logical leap by limiting the use of  "so."  I also want to be able to write logical sentences heartily, so I'd like to be careful to avoid "so."  Oops, it's very difficult.

Similarly, I think we use far too many connective words such as "so", "however", "as a result". If we write sentences using too many connective words, the sentences would give us an impression that it is logical despite being, in fact, illogical.

Thank you so much for your correction!<br/><br/>&gt; Is that suppose to mean that the illogical sentence becomes logical?<br/>I apologize for the confusion. Yes, I wanted to mean like that. <br/><br/>Also, I have one question. I learned that punctuation always goes inside the quotation marks from other native speaker. But should I review the position of punctuation in this case?
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">KuroWinter</span><br>
Since you're quoting a word, the punctuation should be outside. But if youre quoting a sentence, the punctuation should be inside. <br/>E.g. My mother said, "Please do the household chores."<br/>E.g. I believe that vulgar words such as "shit" should not be used.

 Nice post, interesting insight. But sometimes you need to use "so" and "therefore" -- so, use them!
 <br/>
 Haha

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/><br/>Ah, I appreciate your inference.<br/>Yes, I also think "Therefore," at the beginning of a sentence is right. However, a book written by American says that we should not use "Therefore," at almost any case. According to the book, using "Therefore," is too exaggerated (pompous?).<br/><br/>For example,<br/>"Our first attempt met with failure. Therefore, we revised our approach to the problem."<br/>This sentence is too exaggerated (or pompous).<br/>(The book says "Therefore," seems as if one section.)<br/>"Our first attempt met with failure. Therefore we revised our approach to the problem."<br/>By removing the comma, it become little better.<br/>"Our first attempt met with failure. We therefore revised our approach to the problem."<br/>This is even better.<br/>"Our first attempt having met with failure, we revised our approach to the problem."<br/>According to the book, this is the best.<br/><br/>But actually, is the book too exaggerated?

I have to strongly disagree with this guy's argument! In my opinion, the last sentence is the worst of them all. If "therefore" adds any degree of pomposity to a statement, it is so microscopic that I, who have used English my whole life, have never detected it. Forget what that guy wrote -- he wasted your time with complete bullshit!

Thank you very much for your really helpful advice, you saved me!<br/>I will forget what the book said. However, many Japanese blogs still have introduced such wrong information. I think that's horrifying.
