# 【No. 0839】<strong><em>Itamae</em></strong> (Chef)
<div class="date">Apr 5, 2017 08:13</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese word "itamae."<br/><br/>"Ita" means "chopping board," "mae" means "in front of," and "itamae" means a person who work in front of a chopping board, that is, a chef (especially a chef of Japanese cuisine).<br/><br/>Since only "ita" can mean a chef, you can refer to the chef as something like "ita-san."<br/>(Here "san" is an honorific suffix.)<br/><br/>Also, there are several different names related to "itamae" depending on the status of the chef.<br/><br/>The top-ranking person in the cooking place, ie the master chef is called "hanaita" ("hana" means "flower") or "itacho" ("cho" means "top").<br/><br/>The second ranking person in the kitchen (sous-chef) is called "tugiita" ("tugi" means "next") or "wakiita" ("waki" means "supporting").

板前<br/><br/>今日は「板前」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「板」は「まな板」のことであり、「板前」は「まな板の前で働く人」、すなわち料理人（特に日本料理の料理人）を指す言葉です。<br/><br/>「板」だけでも料理人を指すこともあり、「板さん」などと使われることもあります。<br/><br/>また、板前はその地位によって幾つかの異なる呼び名があります。<br/><br/>板場を仕切る最上位の人、すなわち料理長は、「花板」や「板長」と呼ばれます。<br/><br/>そして副料理長は、「次板」や「脇板」などと呼ばれます。

 勉強になりました！

 「花板」という呼び方が好きです。なんか「花」をつくとダントツになるような気がしますね。(●´ー｀●)

そうですね、「花」はとても良い意味で使われることが多いです。例えば「華（花）がある」は、全ての女性が喜ぶ褒め言葉です :)
