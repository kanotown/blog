100回目の投稿<br/><br/>ついに100回目の投稿になりました。<br/><br/>lang-8を始めてから毎日投稿しいていたので、これで100日目ということになります。<br/><br/>しかし、私は未だに間違い（特に a と the の間違えなど）を繰り返してしまいます。<br/><br/>添削して頂いた部分を繰り返し間違えることは、添削して頂いた方に失礼なことだと思います。（本当にすみません。）<br/><br/>毎日復習をすることは非常に大事なことですが、続けるのは大変です。<br/><br/>私は今、過去の投稿からランダムに幾つかの記事を選択して、その記事を復習できるようなソフトウェアの開発を検討しています。<br/><br/>一先ず今日は、過去にして頂いた添削を順番に読んで復習をしようと思います。

 No need to apologize--articles are hard when you're not used to them.  Besides, you didn't make any mistakes with articles in this post.  :)
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Congratulations on 100 posts!  You're doing extremely well.

Since I have posted my journals on Lang-8 every day, <span class="f_gray">today is day 100</span>.
<p class="correction_comment">This structure is a little off. You cannot say "today is day 100" because it is not a direct result of your posting journals every day. If you only posted journals once a week, you could still eventually post 100 journals. Also, even if you took a day or two off, we could still say that today is your 100th day of using Lang-8.<br/><br/>You could say:<br/>I have posted my journals on Lang-8 every day; today is day 100.</p>

 It is not rude to make mistakes! Not as long as you are trying. The difference between "a" and "the" is also very difficult because Japanese does not have anything like this. I don't even know how to explain the difference to Japanese speakers sometimes.

 Your idea sounds really cool. I am also going through and reviewing my old posts in order. There is no other way for  me to mark the ones I have already reviewed so I am just adding numbers to my titles.
 <br/>
 Good luck with your studies.

Thank you very much for correcting me! :)<br/><br/>&gt; It's exciting, right?!<br/>Haha, Yep!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>&gt; I am just adding numbers to my titles. <br/>Oh, it's great idea. This means counting the number of review, don't it? I think counting the number of review is efficient and it will improve our motivations. I will create a software that is implemented counting function.
