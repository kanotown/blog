# 【No. 0338】Silver Ratio
<div class="date">Nov 21, 2015 14:00</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I think you have heard the word "golden ratio."<br/><br/>This ratio,which is represented by about 1:1.618, is the most stable and beautiful ratio, and it is present everywhere in the world.<br/><br/>However, Japanese tend to prefer the silver ratio (1:√2) rather than the golden ratio.<br/><br/>In Japan, the silver ratio is used in many things from ancient buildings to familiar notes.<br/><br/>Most popular anime characters in Japan, such as Doraemon or Totoro, are also have the silver ratio.<br/><br/>Besides, there is also the bronze ratio (around 1:2.303), but ratio this seems to be rarely used.

白銀比<br/><br/>黄金比という言葉を聞いたことがあると思います。<br/><br/>約1:1.618で表される黄金比は最も安定して最も美しいとされる比で、自然界のいたるところに存在します。<br/><br/>しかし日本人は、黄金比よりも白銀比（1 : √2 ）のほうを好む傾向にあるようです。<br/><br/>日本では、古来の建築物から身近なノートまで、あらゆるものにこの白銀比が使われています。<br/><br/>ドラえもんやトトロなど、多くの日本の人気キャラクターも白銀比でできています。<br/><br/>青銅比（約1:2.303）という比もありますが、こちらはあまり使われている事例が多くないようです。

 Good work on the entry!  I know about the golden and silver ratios, but I didn't know about the Japanese's apparent affinity to the silver ratio.
