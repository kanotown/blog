<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Daikon-ashi</strong></em> (Daikon Radish Legs)</h1>
<div class="date">Sep 28, 2016 00:18</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "daikon-ashi".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "daikon/Japanese radish legs", and it is used for comparing women legs to daikon radishes in many cases.<br/><br/>(The kanji "足" (feet) is commonly used for the "ashi" in the "daikon-ashi", but it means "脚" (legs) in this word.)<br/><br/>Currently, this word is used as a bad meaning, and implies that the woman's legs are thick like a daikon radish.<br/><br/>However, daikon radishes were actually very thin in the past.<br/><br/>Therefore, comparing women's legs or arms to daikon radishes meant "they're thin and white," and was a compliment expression.<br/><br/>If you make a slip of the tongue and say "daikon-ashi" to a woman, you should say "of course in the past meaning" quickly.

大根足<br/><br/>今日は、「大根足」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>文字通りの意味は "daikon radish legs" で、多くの場合、女性の脚を大根に例えて用いられます。<br/><br/>（「大根足」では「足」という漢字が使われますが、通常は「脚」を意味します。）<br/><br/>現在ではこの言葉は、「脚が大根のように太い」という悪い意味で使われます。<br/><br/>しかし、昔の大根はとても細かったそうです。<br/><br/>そのため、「脚」や「腕」を大根に例えた表現は、「白くて細い」ということを意味する褒め言葉でした。<br/><br/>つい口がすべって女性に「大根足」と言ってしまったら、急いで「昔の意味でね」とフォローしましょう。
