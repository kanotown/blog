Thank you so much for the correction!<br/><br/>Previously, I learned that foreign languages (such as Japanese) should be written in italics, but we cannot use italics on Lang-8, so in my posts, I've used single quotes instead of italics for Japanese terms. When my posts on Lang-8 move to my blog, the single quotes are changed to italics.
