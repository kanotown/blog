ポチ<br/><br/>犬は、ペットとしての歴史が最も古い動物であり、日本でも多くの犬が飼育されています。<br/><br/>その犬に付ける名前として、日本で最も一般的なものは「ポチ」です。<br/><br/>語源はさまざまあり、フランス語で「小さい」を意味する "petit" (プチ) や、英語で「ぶち犬」を意味する "spotty" (スポッティ) や "Pooch" (プーチ), チェコ語で「来い」を意味する "Pojd'" (ポチュ), 日本語で「小さなもの」を意味する「これっぽっち」から来ている説などがあります。<br/><br/>犬の代名詞として最も一般的な日本語は、犬の鳴き声である「ワン」に「ちゃん」をつけた「ワンちゃん」ですが、「ポチ」もまた犬の代名詞として一般的です。
