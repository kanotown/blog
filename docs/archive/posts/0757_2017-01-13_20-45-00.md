# 【No. 0757】<strong><em>Fuda Tsuki</strong></em> (Notorious)
<div class="date">Jan 13, 2017 20:45</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I talked about "osumi tsuki" yesterday, and "origami tsuki" the day before yesterday.<br/><br/>Both of these terms are used in good meanings.<br/><br/>Today I will talk about the Japanese term "fuda tsuki", which is used in a bad meaning.<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "attached tag", and it means that someone is notorious.<br/><br/>During the Edo period, when someone  committed a crime, his/her family and surrounding people were treated as suspicious characters.<br/><br/>At that time, tags were attached on such people on their family registers, so "fuda tsuki" (attached tag) came to mean the above meaning.

札付き<br/><br/>昨日は「お墨付き」、一昨日は「折り紙つき」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>これらはどちらも、良い意味で使われます。<br/><br/>今日は、悪い意味で使われる「札付き」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「札付き」は、悪い評判が周囲に知れ渡っていることを意味します。<br/><br/>江戸時代、ある人が罪を犯すと、その家族や周囲の人間も要注意人物として扱われていました。<br/><br/>このとき、要注意人物には戸籍謄本のようなものに札を付けていたことから、現在の意味で使われるようになったと言われています。

 Interesting! This is somehow similar to "branding" that was a form of corporal punishment used in the medieval Europe.
