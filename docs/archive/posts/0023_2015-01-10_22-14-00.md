<h1 id="subject_show">Coin Tossing Probability</h1>

Today, I want to talk about coin toss probability.<br/><br/>Please imagine that you toss 2000 coins.<br/><br/>Each coin will fall and rest with either side face up "heads" or "tails" with equal probability.<br/><br/>Well then, what is the probability that at least 1100 heads appear?<br/><br/>When I saw this problem for the first time, I thought intuitively the answer is around a few percent.<br/><br/>However, the actual answer is around 0.0004 percent, and it can be derived easily from a normal distribution.<br/><br/>This fact implies strong convergence of the probability.<br/><br/>I wondered the result for a while such as when I'm faced with a paradox, but people with probabilistic sense will understand without much resistance.

Each coin will fall and rest with either side face up "heads" or "tails" with equal probability.
<p class="correction_comment">This sentence is good, but I think it may sound better as: Each coin will land with either the "heads" or the "tails" face up, both having an equal probability.</p>

Well then, what is the probability that at least 1100 heads appear?
