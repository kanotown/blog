日本語の「赤」の意味<br/><br/>赤という言葉は、様々な意味で使われることがあります。<br/><br/>例えば、「明らかな」「まったくの」といった意味があり、「赤の他人」や「真っ赤な嘘」のように使われます。<br/><br/>他にも、簿記における欠損などを赤色の文字で書くことから、「赤字」という言葉ができました。<br/><br/>同様に、試験などで進級が危ぶまれるような悪い点数を「赤点」と言います。<br/><br/>また、生まれたばかりの子供は皮膚が赤く見えることから、「赤ちゃん」「赤ん坊」「赤子」などと言われます。

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, I'm not sure what it means here.<br/>Sorry for my confusing English.<br/>I wanted to say something like:<br/>In financial statements, we use red ink for deficit budgets. Therefore, we became to use the expression "赤字(the literal meaning is red figure)" in the sense of "deficit budgets."<br/>I hope my English make sense.

oh that makes so much more sense! I didn't know. Maybe<br/><br/>In financial statements, we use red ink for deficit budgets. Therefore, we use the expression "赤字(the literal meaning is red figure)" in the sense of "deficit budgets."

 I think the Japanese use of 青 is pretty interesting too. A green traffic light in English is a 青 light in Japanese, right?

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>&gt; A green traffic light in English is a 青 light in Japanese, right?<br/>Yes, that's right! Actually, I previously posted an article about it.
