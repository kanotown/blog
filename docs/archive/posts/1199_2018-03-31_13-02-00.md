花見団子<br/><br/>日本人は花見の際、よく団子を食べます。<br/><br/>この団子は「花見団子」と呼ばれ、江戸時代からの定番となっています。<br/><br/>多くの場合、花見団子は3色の団子が一つの串に刺さったものとなっています。<br/><br/>団子の色は上から順に、桜色、白色、緑色となっており、それぞれ春、冬、夏の季節を表しているという説が一般的です。<br/><br/>また、桜色は桜、白色は春の空、緑色はよもぎで、3色全てが春を表しているという説もあります。

 Hi Toru!   You're writing is very good.  I enjoyed learning about hanami dango.  Most of my suggestions were either stylistic preferences or phrases that would make it read more smoothly and sound more natural.

Thank you so much for the corrections and explanations!<br/>Actually, the reason why I use quotation marks for Japanese terms is because some Japanese words are very confusing when they are included in English sentences. For example, there are "to" (と/戸 - and/door), "no" (の/野 - of/field), "shake" (鮭 - salmon), etc. If it's possible, I want to use italics instead of quotation marks.

Good point!  I can see how that would get confusing.<br/><br/>Have a great day!

 質問です。
 <br/>
 違う色のお団子はみんな同じ味わいですか。
 <br/>
 勝手に桜色のお団子がイチゴ味がすると思い込んでいますけれど(´∀｀*)
</p>

こんにちは、スイちゃん。<br/>もともとは全て白色で、ほんのり甘い味がします。<br/>安い花見団子は合成着色料で色を付けるので、どれも同じ味です。<br/><br/>和菓子屋などで売っている少し高級な花見団子の場合、<br/>桜色のものは赤しそ、緑色のものはよもぎなどが使われます。<br/><br/>このため、桜色の団子はイチゴ味ではなくて梅味ですね～。
