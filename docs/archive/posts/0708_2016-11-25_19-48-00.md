<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the four-Chinese character idiom "tanto chokunyu."<br/><br/>"Tanto chokunyu" means to get straight to the main point with no preamble.<br/><br/>For example: "Tanto chokunyu ni iuto, kimi wa kubi da." (I'll get straight to the point. You're fired.)<br/><br/>This idiom comes from the Chinese history book called "The Records of the Transmission of the Lamp."<br/><br/>"Tanto" means "a single sword," "chokunyu" means "to enter straight into somewhere," and "tanto chokunyu" originally meant that someone rushes into an enemy position by oneself with a single sword.<br/><br/>Deriving from it, this idiom has come to mean to the above meaning.

単刀直入<br/><br/>今日は「単刀直入」という四字熟語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「単刀直入」は、前置きなどを省略していきなり本題に入ることや、核心をつくことを表します。<br/><br/>例「単刀直入に言うと、君はクビだ」<br/><br/>この言葉は、中国・北宋代の燈史「景徳傳燈録」に由来します。<br/><br/>もともとは、一人で刀を一振り持ち、敵陣に斬り込むことを意味していました。<br/><br/>これが派生し、いきなり本題に入ることを意味するようになりました。
