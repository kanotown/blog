一期一会<br/><br/>今日は私が去年卒業した大学の卒業式の日です。<br/><br/>そのため、私は恩師とその研究室の人たちに会いに来ました。<br/><br/>しかし、今年度から新しく研究室に配属された学生とはほとんど面識がありません。<br/><br/>今日は顔を合わせて色々とお話をしましたが、もう今後会うことはないかもしれません。<br/><br/>このような出会いのこと、そしてこのような出会いを大切にすることを、日本では「一期一会」と呼びます。<br/><br/>「一期一会」の「一期」は人の一生を表す仏教の言葉で、「一会」は「一度だけ会う」ということを意味します。<br/><br/>素敵な言葉なので、ぜひ覚えておいて下さい。

 Your English is really good, and there were hardly any mistakes so I just made some small strict corrections..

 And "一期一会" is a really wonderful proverb. Thank you for sharing it! It's really strange to think about all the different people we happen to encounter with. It's exciting but also dreadful at the same time.

Thank you so much for correcting my post again!<br/>I'm glad to hear you say that (^^)<br/><br/>Actually this proverb just implies something like the following :)<br/>Provide your best service always because you may not meet them ever again.<br/>「一度しか会わないのかもしれないのだから、今できる最高のおもてなしを常にしましょう。」

Ah, I understand. That's a really good concept. I'll try to keep it in mind from now on :)
