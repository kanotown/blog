# 【No. 2214】<strong><em>Kōya no Asatte</em></strong> (紺屋の明後日 - One of These Days Is None of These Days)
<div class="date">Nov 13, 2023 19:12</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kōya no Asatte</em></strong><br/><br/>The Japanese phrase <strong><em>kōya no asatte</em></strong> (紺屋の明後日) can be used to describe that the promised due date is unreliable.<br/><br/><strong><em>Kōya</em></strong> (紺屋) was used in the Edo period to refer to a dyer.<br/><br/>In addition, <strong><em>asatte</em></strong> (明後日) means "the day after tomorrow," so the literal meaning of <em>kōya no asatte</em> is "the day after tomorrow of a dyer."<br/><br/>Since a dyer's work was greatly affected by the weather in the process of drying cloth, their completion dates were often delayed.<br/><br/>Therefore, when the dyer mentioned "the day after tomorrow," it came to be regarded as unreliable, which led to the current meaning of this phrase.

紺屋の明後日<br/><br/>約束の期日が当てにならないことを、「紺屋の明後日」と表現することができます。<br/><br/>「紺屋」は、江戸時代に使われていた言葉で、染め物屋を意味します。<br/><br/>また、「明後日」は "the day after tomorrow" を意味するので、「紺屋の明後日」の文字どおりの意味は "the day after tomorrow of a dyer" となります。<br/><br/>染め物屋は、布を乾かす工程が天候の影響を大きく受けるため、仕上げが予定よりも遅れることが多くあったそうです。<br/><br/>そんな染め物屋の言う「明後日」は、当てにならないというわけです。
