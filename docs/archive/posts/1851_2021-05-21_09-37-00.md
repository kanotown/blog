<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kiite Gokuraku Mite Jigoku</strong></em><br/><br/>Have you ever had an impression that what you heard and what you saw were completely different?<br/><br/>In particular, when what you actually saw is terrible, it can be described as <strong><em>kiite gokuraku mite jigoku</em></strong> (聞いて極楽見て地獄).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>kiite</em></strong> (聞いて) means "to hear," <strong><em>gokuraku</em></strong> (極楽) means "paradise/heaven," <strong><em>mite</em></strong> (見て) means "to see," and <strong><em>jigoku</em></strong> (地獄) means "hell," the literal meaning of <em>kiite gokuraku mite jigoku</em> is "it is paradise when you hear it, hell when you see it."<br/><br/>This phrase implies that the difference between hearing and seeing is as great as the difference between paradise and hell.

聞いて極楽見て地獄<br/><br/>聞いた内容と見た内容で、全く異なる印象を受けたことはありませんか？<br/><br/>実際に見てみたらひどいものであった場合、「聞いて極楽見て地獄」と表現することができます。<br/><br/>「聞いて」は "to hear"、「極楽」は "paradise/heaven"、「見て」は "to see"、「地獄」は "hell" を意味するので、「聞いて極楽見て地獄」の文字どおりの意味は "it is paradise when you hear it, hell when you see it" となります。<br/><br/>聞いた話と実際に見るのとでは、極楽と地獄ほどの差があるということです。
