# 【No. 0597】<strong><em>Ichi ka Bachi ka</strong></em> (One or Eight)
<div class="date">Aug 6, 2016 16:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese idiom "ichi ka bachi ka."<br/><br/>"Ichi" means "one," "ka" means "or," "bachi" means "eight," and "ichi ka bachi ka" means something like "I don't know what the result will be, but I'll take my chances."<br/><br/>(My dictionary says that "ichi ka bachi ka" means "all or nothing," "sink or swim," or "hit or miss.")<br/><br/>This is originally a gambling term, and it's said that "ichi" (一) and "hachi" (八) comes from the top parts of kanji of "cho" (丁) and "han" (半), respectively.<br/><br/>(In the past, we mainly bet on whether the sum of two dice would be even (cho) or odd (han) in gambling places.)<br/><br/>There is another theory that insists "ichi ka bachi ka" comes from "ichi ka batsu ka" (the dice shows one, or you will receive punishment.). <br/><br/>Anyway, the etymology is gambling using dice.

一か八か<br/><br/>今日は日本の慣用句「一か八か」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「一か八か」は、「結果がどうなるかはわからないけれど、運に任せて挑戦してみること」を意味します。<br/><br/>元々この言葉は賭博用語であり、「一」は「丁」（偶数）、「八」は「半」（奇数）の漢字の上部分をとったものだと言われています。<br/><br/>（かつての日本の賭博では、主に2つのサイコロの目の合計が偶数（丁）か奇数（半）かを賭けていました。）<br/><br/>もう一つの説として、「（サイコロの目が）一か罰か」が変化したというものもあります。<br/><br/>いずれにしても、サイコロによる賭博が由来です。
