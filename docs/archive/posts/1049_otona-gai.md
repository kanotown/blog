大人買い<br/><br/>私は子供の頃、いつか「大人買い」をしたいと思っていました。<br/><br/>「大人」は "adult," 「買い」は "to buy" ですが、決して変な意味ではありません。<br/><br/>「大人買い」とは、食玩やカードなど、コレクション性のあるブラインドパッケージ商品を一度に大量に購入することを意味します。<br/><br/>もちろん、これら商品は子供向けのもので、本来は少量ずつ買うべき低額商品です。<br/><br/>大人であれば、財力に物を言わせてこれら商品を大量に買うことができます。<br/><br/>このことから、そのような行為を「大人買い」と呼ぶようになり、現在では一般的な商品に対する「まとめ買い」のような意味で使われることもあります。
