文化の日<br/><br/>今日（11月3日）は文化の日であり、多くの日本人にとって祝日です。<br/><br/>文化の日は1948年に施行され、「自由と平和を愛し、文化をすすめる」ことを趣旨としています。<br/><br/>今日は皇居で文化勲章の親授式が行われたり、日本武道館で全日本剣道選手権大会が開催されたり、海上自衛隊の自衛艦において満艦飾が行われたりします。<br/><br/>幾つかの博物館や美術館は、入館料を無料にしたり催し物を開催したりもします。<br/><br/>また、この日は例年晴天になる確率が高い日であり、私も今朝布団を干しました。<br/><br/>ちなみに、私の大学では今日は祝日ではありません。
