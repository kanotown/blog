# 【No. 0524】Henachoko
<div class="date">May 25, 2016 20:32</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about a Japanese word "henachoko."<br/><br/>Henachoko is a taunting word that expresses an immature or unimportant person.<br/><br/>"Hena" in henachoko came from an imitative word "henahena" that expresses frail things.<br/><br/>"Choko" in henachoko means something like a small move, and is also used in "chokomaka (move quickly and restlessly)" or "chokozai (cheeky)" in Japanese.<br/><br/>Using this word to others is rude, but I like the sound of "henachoko."

へなちょこ<br/><br/>今日は、日本語の「へなちょこ」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>へなちょこは、未熟な人や取るに足らない人をあざけって指す言葉です。<br/><br/>へなちょこの「へな」は、手応えのないものや弱々しいものを表す「へなへな」という擬態語から来ています。<br/><br/>へなちょこの「ちょこ」は、「ちょこまか」や「ちょこざい」などで使われるように、「小さな動作」のような意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>他人に対して使うと失礼ですが、私はこの言葉の響きがなかなか好きです。

 You could say "this word is rude,..."

 Note that this is also a compound sentence. This time the second part does have a subject, so you do need the comma.

<p class="correction_comment">It isn't exactly wrong, but I don't think most people can understand what "imitative word" means. You could say something like "onomatopoeia," but that's not exactly right. Usually, I'd probably just omit it and say "comes from the word 'henahena,' which means..."</p>

<li class="incorrect">Henachoko is a taunting word that expresses an immature or unimportant person.</li>

<p class="correction_comment">The original sentence would be understandable by a native English speaker but the grammar is unusual. "a taunting word" implies we have a category of words for taunting and we do and simply call them "taunts". <br/>For some reason "a taunt that expresses" is odd to my ears because the taunt can only express something the person intends, so the taunt is not expressing but the person using it is. Because of this, I suggest "a taunt used to express" to show that a person is using a taunt to create a feeling or impression.</p>

<li class="corrected correct">
"Hena" in henachoko <span class="f_blue">comes </span>from an imitative word "henahena" that expresses frail things.
<p class="correction_comment">The original sentence would be understandable and most people may not notice that verb tense if you speak. However, I suggest "comes" to imply that "hena" and "henachoko" are still in use and have an active relationship.If either hena by itself or henachoko were no longer used came may be more correct though would explain that in the sentence.</p>

Using this word <span class="sline">to</span> <span class="f_red">on</span> others is rude, but I like the sound of "henachoko."<span class="f_blue">Saying this word to others is rude,....</span>
<p class="correction_comment">In English, we have this odd concept that words are "applied on" people because some words we think of as "labels" or "titles" and those are put "on" something or someone. In order to use "to" I have the alternate suggestion in blue. We "say" words "to" someone.</p>

 I like the sound of this word now, too! Thank you for teaching me!
