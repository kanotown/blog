<h1 id="subject_show">JK</h1>
<div class="date">Jun 21, 2015 14:46</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned a slang phrase 'jk (just kidding).'<br/><br/>In Japan, <em>jk</em> is also used as slang, and it has two meanings.<br/><br/>One is "high school girls (joshi kousei)," and the other is "by thinking it in common sense (joushikitekini kangaete)." <br/><br/>Therefore, I think I can say something like "JK! She's JK, JK. "<br/><br/>(Just kidding! She's a high school girl by thinking it in common sense.)<br/><br/>By the way, if we search <em>JK</em> on Google Images of the US, we can see a lot of pictures of J.K. Rowling.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if we search <em>JK</em> on Google Images of Japan, we can see a lot of high school girls.
