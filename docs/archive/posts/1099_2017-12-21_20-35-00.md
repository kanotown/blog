<div class="date">Dec 21, 2017 20:35</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I sometimes interrupted others in the middle of talking.<br/><br/>Such an action is called 話の腰を折る (hanashi no koshi wo oru) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The 話 (hanashi) means "story/conversation," the 腰 (koshi) means "a lower back/waist," and the 折る (oru) means "to break," so the literal meaning of this term is "to break a lower back of conversation."<br/><br/>"A lower back" is a very important part of the body, and if it's hurt, it will become difficult to support your body.<br/><br/>Because of this, 話の腰を折る has come to mean to interrupt when someone is talking.

話の腰を折る<br/><br/>今日、私は何度か他人が話しているところに口をはさみ、会話を遮ってしまいました。<br/><br/>このような行為のことを、日本語で「話の腰を折る」と言います。<br/><br/>「話」は "story/conversation," 「腰」は "lower back," 「折る」は "to break" を意味するので、「話の腰を折る」の文字通りの意味は "to break a lower back of conversation" となります。<br/><br/>「腰」は、体の中でも重要な部分であり、少し痛めただけでも体を支えるのが困難になります。<br/><br/>このことからこの言葉は、会話を遮って邪魔をすることを意味するようになりました。

The 話 (hanashi) means "story/conversation," the 腰 (koshi) means "lower back/waist," and the 折る (oru) means "to break," so the literal meaning of this term is "to break the lower back of the conversation."
<p class="correction_comment">Usually when translating words to English like this you leave out 'a' or 'the'. Could also be "to break the lower back of a conversation", which sounds a little bit more general than 'the', but honestly both could work.</p>

<li class="corrected correct">
The lower back is a very important part of the body, and if it's hurt, it will become difficult to support your body.
<p class="correction_comment">Here you would put 'the', because otherwise the sentence becomes ungrammatical. "the" is more appropriate than a because the body only has one lower back. This means it is more natural sounding to use the more specific <br/><br/>"the". In the last sentence you already introduced the word "lower back", so it is okay to leave out the " symbols.</p>

<li class="corrected correct">
Because of this, 話の腰を折る has come to mean to interrupt when someone is talking.
<p class="correction_comment">"interrupt someone when they're talking" could also work, if you are specifically talking about interrupting the person that is doing the talking.</p>
