# 【No. 0769】<strong><em>Decchiage</strong></em> (To Make Up a Story )
<div class="date">Jan 25, 2017 10:28</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the term "decchiage."<br/><br/>"Decchiage" means to make up a story as if it were actually happened.<br/><br/>Usage example: Kare no hanashi wa subete decchiage da (All his stories are hoaxes). Buyuden wo decchiageru (I cook my heroic story up).<br/><br/>This term comes from the Han reading of "捏" in "捏造 (netsuzo)," which has the same meaning of "decchiage."<br/><br/>The Han reading of "捏" is "detsu," and it came to be verbalized as "decchiageru," then it came to also be used as the noun form "decchiage."<br/><br/>By the way, the Hiragana form of "でつ (detsu)" looks like Snoopy.

でっち上げ<br/><br/>今日は「でっち上げ」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「でっち上げ」は、実際にはなかったことを事実のように仕立て上げることを言います。<br/><br/>例：彼の話は全てでっち上げだ。武勇伝をでっちあげる。<br/><br/>この言葉は、同じ意味を持つ「捏造（ねつぞう）」の「捏」の漢音から来ています。<br/><br/>「捏」の漢音は「でつ」であり、これが動詞化され「でっち上げる」となり、「でっち上げ」のように名詞としても使われるようになりました。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「でつ」とひらがなで書くとスヌーピーに見えます。
