筋肉痛<br/><br/>昨日、久しぶりに運動して、現在全身が筋肉痛です。<br/><br/>「筋肉」は "muscle"、「痛」は "pain" を意味するので、「筋肉痛」は文字どおり "muscle pain" といういう意味になります。<br/><br/>筋肉痛は、筋肉が普段使われない方法で使われたり、慣れない運動をしたときに起こりやすく、大きく次の2つに分けることができます。<br/><br/>急性筋肉痛：瞬間的に大きな負荷がかかることで、運動中または運動直後に感じる筋肉の痛み。<br/><br/>遅発性筋肉痛：運動後1〜3日後に強く感じられる筋肉の痛み。数日間続くことがある。一般的に筋肉痛と言うとこちらを指す。<br/><br/>筋肉痛は普段からの運動や、運動前後の準備運動やクールダウン、ストレッチで回避することができます。
