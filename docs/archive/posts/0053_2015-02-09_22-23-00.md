# 【No. 0053】Ergonomic Keyboard
<div class="date">Feb 9, 2015 22:23</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I bought a ergonomic keyboard designed by Microsoft because Amazon had had a time sale. The keys of this keyboard is divided into right and left, and the center is swelling. This curved keyboard layout is based on ergonomics in order to let us rest our hand and wrist, and let us reach keys easily. However, it is difficult for me to type letters using this keyboard for now. That is because I usually type <em>B</em> by my right hand while <em>B</em> key is left side on this keyboard. As a result of measuring my typing using this keyboard, mistyped rate increased 30% and typing speed decreased 40%. I need many practice to master it.
