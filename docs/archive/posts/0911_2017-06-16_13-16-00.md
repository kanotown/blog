<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Giongo and Gitaigo</strong></em> (Onomatopoeia)</h1>
<div class="date">Jun 16, 2017 13:16</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Up to now, I introduced several times about Japanese giongo (擬音語) / giseigo (擬声語) and gitaigo (擬態語).<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/86267710602984537206970840486887149264" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/86267710602984537206970840486887149264</a><br/><br/>Both of them can be translated into English as <em>onomatopoeia,</em> but there is a clear difference in the way of use.<br/><br/>Giongo/giseigo is a term that represents an actual sound caused by people, animal, or things.<br/>For example, a dog's bark is "wan wan" (ワンワン), and a sound of thunder is "goro goro" (ゴロゴロ).<br/><br/><br/>On the other hand, gitaigo represents someone's/something's state or emotion that doesn't generate any sound.<br/>For example, something shining/new/beautiful is "kira kira" (きらきら), and staring at someone's face or something is "jiro jiro" (じろじろ).<br/><br/>It might be hard for foreigner to understand gitaigo, but it's necessary in our daily conversation.<br/><br/>From now on, I will sometimes write about Japanese gitaigo, adding a tag "onomatopoeia."

擬音語と擬態語<br/><br/>これまで、私は日本語の擬音語（擬声語）や擬態語について、何度か投稿してきました。<br/><br/>これらはどちらも 'onomatopoeia' と英語に訳されますが、明確な使い方の違いがあります。<br/><br/>擬音語は、人や動物、物が発する音を言葉で表現したものです。<br/>例：ワンワン（犬の鳴き声）、ゴロゴロ（雷の鳴る音）<br/><br/>一方で擬態語は、状態や感情などの音を発しないものを文字で表現したものです。<br/>例：ぴかぴか（光っている/新しい/綺麗な様）、じろじろ（人の顔などを見つめるさま）<br/><br/>外国人が日本語の擬態語を理解するのは難しいかもしれませんが、我々の日常会話で擬態語は欠かせないものとなっています。<br/><br/>今後、'onomatopoeia' というタグを付けて、たまに日本語の擬態語を紹介していこうと思います。

 Good writing, only minor changes.

 That is a very interesting concept...I am not sure that I can think of an equivalent in English! I would be fascinated to know more about how this works in Japanese.

It might be hard for a foreigner to understand gitaigo, but it's necessary in our daily conversation.
<p class="correction_comment">for foreigner --&gt; for a foreigner<br/><br/>necessary in --&gt; necessary for - It just feels better. You might use gitaigo in your daily conversation but you must understand gitaigo because it's necessary for your daily conversation.  Just a thought.</p>

 Your post inspired me to do some more looking. I found this:

 No wonder I didn't "get it.."

Take tofugu's entries on these things with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>I once read an entry about japanese words of Portuguese origin and there were so many errors that they removed the page just to not deal with the backlash.

Thank you so much for your corrections!<br/><br/>&gt; is a term --&gt; are terms - Aren't they two different terms for different aspects of how Japanese uses onomatopoeia?<br/>Some consider that giongo and giseigo are different in a fine sense, but both are often regarded as the same. I wanted to say just something like "Giongo, which you might call giseigo, is a term..."<br/><br/>&gt; Just curious, should it be Giyougo that represents someone's emotion?<br/>Originally, Japanese onomatopoeias are divided into two types, giongo/giseigo and gitaigo.　However, since gitaigo had a lot of type, a famous Japanese proposed that it should be divided into three -- gitaigo, giyougo, and gijougo. In my opinion, gitaigo usually includes these three, and giyugo and gijougo are not generally used.<br/><br/>And thank you for letting me know the webpage. I think that it's informative :)
