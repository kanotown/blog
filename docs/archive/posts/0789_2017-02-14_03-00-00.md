日本のバレンタインデー<br/><br/>今日はバレンタインデーです。<br/><br/>この日、多くの国では、男性から女性に花束やカード、ケーキ、チョコレートなどを贈る習慣があります。<br/><br/>一方、日本や韓国など一部の国では、女性が気になる男性にチョコレートを贈る習慣があります。<br/><br/>このため、ここ最近のスーパーマーケットなどでは、大量のチョコレートが並んでいました。<br/><br/>ちなみに、日本でのバレンタインチョコは幾つかの種類に分けられます。<br/><br/>「本命チョコ」・・・愛の告白として贈るチョコです。<br/><br/>「義理チョコ」・・・愛情感情を伴わない男性に、感謝の印（もしくは社交辞令）として贈るチョコです。<br/><br/>「友チョコ」・・・女性同士で贈り合うチョコです。<br/><br/>「逆チョコ」・・・男性が女性に贈るチョコです。<br/><br/>私は今日、何名かにベルギーのチョコをおみやげとして贈るつもりであるため、バレンタインとは無関係であることを説明する必要があります。
