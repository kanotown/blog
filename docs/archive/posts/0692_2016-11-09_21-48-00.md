<h1 id="subject_show">"皿" (Plate) and "血" (Blood)</h1>
<div class="date">Nov 9, 2016 21:48</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the derivations of the similar kanji "皿" (which means "plate") and "血" (which means "blood").<br/><br/>The kanji "皿" comes from a hieroglyphic character that symbolizes "plate".<br/><br/>In the kanji "血", the added shape "ノ" on "皿" means a cup of blood, and "血" expresses a plate that contains blood.<br/><br/>In the past in China, it's said that people devoted human's (or animal's) blood poured into a plate to God during festivals.<br/><br/>This is the reason why "plate" and "blood" have the similar kanji.

皿と血<br/><br/>今日は、よく似ている漢字の「皿」と「血」の成り立ちを紹介します。<br/><br/>「皿」は、お皿の形をかたどった象形文字です。<br/><br/>「血」という漢字において皿の上にある「ノ」は血の塊を意味し、皿に血が入っていることを表しています。<br/><br/>かつて中国では、祭りの際に神へのお供え物として、皿に生贄（動物や人間）の血を入れて捧げていました。<br/><br/>これが、意味が大きく異なるのに漢字が似ている理由です。

 Very very interesting! I was taught that it was a speck of blood on a plate, but the cup makes a lot more sense. Thanks!
