# 【No. 1031】<strong><em>Jigajisan</strong></em> (自画自賛 - Self-Admiration)
<div class="date">Oct 14, 2017 12:23</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I think that everyone would like to praise himself/herself sometimes.<br/><br/>To praise oneself is often referred to as "jigajisan" (自画自賛) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Here the "ji" (自) means "my" or "myself," and "ga" (画) means "painting."<br/><br/>Also, in Oriental paintings, inscriptions/poetry related to the painting are called "san" (賛).<br/><br/>That is to say, the original meaning of "jigajisan" is to write an inscription/poetry of your painting.<br/><br/>It is thought that since the kanji "賛" (san) include the meaning of "praise," this term has come to mean "praising oneself" or "self-admiration."

自画自賛<br/><br/>たまには、自分のことを褒めたくなることがあると思います。<br/><br/>自分自身を褒めることを、日本語ではよく「自画自賛」という四字熟語で表現します。<br/><br/>「自」は "my" や "myself," 「画」は "painting" を意味します。<br/><br/>そして、東洋画ではその絵画に関する詩文のことを 「賛」もしくは「画賛」と言います。<br/><br/>すなわち「自画自賛」の本来の意味は、自分の描いた絵に対して自分で詩文を書くことを言いします。<br/><br/>「賛」というには「褒める」という意味も含まれることから、現在の「自分自身を褒める」や「自慢」のような意味になったと考えられています。

 Interesting! If there is no one around to praise you for your deeds, why not to do it yourself :)

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>I think that many people often praise themselves just in their hearts :)
