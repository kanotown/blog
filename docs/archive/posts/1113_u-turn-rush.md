Uターンラッシュ<br/><br/>私は先週金曜日から、実家に帰省しています。<br/><br/>そして明日から仕事があるので、今日には東京に戻らなければなりません。<br/><br/>もともとは1日余裕を持たせるため、昨日東京に帰るつもりでしたが、「Uターンラッシュ」のニュースを見てやめました。<br/><br/>「Uターンラッシュ」とは、正月に実家に帰省していた人たちが、仕事のため東京にUターンする際の混雑を意味する言葉です。<br/><br/>私が使う予定の高速道路は、最長31kmの渋滞だったそうです。<br/><br/>多くの日本人は今日から仕事が始まるため、昨日は道路だけでなく、交通機関も混雑がひどかったようです。<br/><br/>私は今日、空いている高速を悠々と運転します。
