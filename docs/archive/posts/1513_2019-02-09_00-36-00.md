<div class="date">Feb 9, 2019 00:36</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Jigou Jitoku</strong></em><br/><br/>Yesterday, I introduced you to the Japanese idiom <strong><em>boketsu wo horu</em></strong> (墓穴を掘る), which means to make a factor that ruins yourself with your own hands.<br/><br/>Today, I would like to talk about the four-character idiom <strong><em>jigou jitoku</em></strong> (自業自得), which has a similar meaning to <em>boketsu wo horu</em>.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ji</em></strong> (自) means "oneself," <strong><em>gou</em></strong> (業) means "deed," and <strong><em>toku</em></strong> (得) means "profit."<br/><br/>Originally, this idiom was a Buddhist term and is usually used to mean that your good or bad deed give you what you deserve.<br/><br/>However, these days, this idiom is usually used to mean that you pay a price for your bad behavior.
