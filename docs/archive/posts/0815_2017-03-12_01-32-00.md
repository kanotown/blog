腕時計<br/><br/>私は昨日、アウトレットモールで腕時計を買いました。<br/><br/>少し高い買い物でしたが、気に入ったデザインのものを通常よりも安く買うことができて、とても満足しています。<br/><br/>イギリスの世論調査機関「YouGov」によると、16～34歳の若者の半数以上が、時間を知る方法として携帯電話を使用しているそうです。<br/><br/>また、日本の企業が20～30代の社会人にアンケート調査を行ったところ、3人に1人は腕時計をつけずに仕事に行くとのことでした。<br/><br/>携帯電話・スマートフォンの普及により、腕時計をつけない若者が急増しているようです。<br/><br/>実際私も普段はあまり着けていませんでした。<br/><br/>ただ、どういうわけか最近、良い腕時計を身に着けたいという欲求にかられるようになりました。<br/><br/>いつか、もっともっと良い腕時計を買いたいです。

<p class="correction_comment">The parentheses mean you have to choose one of the options provided.<br/>"In fact" isn't incorrect, but it sounds unnatural, because its function is to contradict what was said earlier. However, the earlier point was about a general tendency among young people. Whether a single person (meaning you) fit this tendency isn't really relevant.<br/>Past habits (or their lack) are often expressed with "used to".</p>

<p class="correction_comment">Not many people feel an urge to wear multiple watches, which is why a reader can think the original sentence is sort of odd. If you wanted to say that you had an urge to own many good watches so that you could wear a different one each day, you should express it more precisely.</p>

<p class="comment_small">
 One of the functions of modern marketing is attaching a sense of additional value to otherwise ordinary objects. Similarly, sometimes the goal is to create a sense of need in the buyer. I think it's wise to consider this before paying a high price for a gadget.
 <br/>
 Overall, the quality of your writing is high, but you should try practising the perfect tenses.

Thank you so much for the corrections and your helpful explanations!<br/><br/>Yes, we have to consider the necessity and the additional value. Speaking of watches, if it comes to luxury watches above a certain price, it will be almost completely fashion.

<p class="correction_comment">(in blue)<br/>This is an appositive phrase.  "YouGov" is renaming "the British institution."
