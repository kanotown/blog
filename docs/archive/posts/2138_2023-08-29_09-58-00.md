<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Takane no Hana</strong></em> (高嶺の花 - Out of One's League)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Aug 29, 2023 09:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Takane no Hana</strong></em><br/><br/>An attractive person (especially a woman) whom one cannot reach and can only admire from afar is called <strong><em>takane no hana</em></strong> (高嶺の花) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>taka/takai</em></strong> (高/高い) means "high," <strong><em>ne</em></strong> (嶺) means "peak," and <strong><em>hana</em></strong> (花) means "flower," the literal meaning of <em>takane no hana</em> is "a flower on a high peak."<br/><br/>Even if a beautiful flower blooming on a high peak can be admired from afar, it is not easy to go and pick it.<br/><br/>In other words, this idiom is a metaphor for a woman whose character and appearance are too outstanding to be approachable, just like a flower on a high peak that is difficult to reach.

高嶺の花<br/><br/>遠くから眺めることが精一杯で、手に入れることのできない魅力的な人（特に女性）のことを、日本語で「高嶺の花」と言います。<br/><br/>「高」は "high"、「嶺」は "peak"、「花」は "flower" を意味するので、「高嶺の花」の文字どおりの意味は "a flower on a high peak" となります。<br/><br/>高嶺に咲く美しい花は、遠くから眺めることはできても、なかなか採りにいくことができません。<br/><br/>性格や容姿が優れ過ぎていて近寄りがたい女性を、採りに行くことが難しい高嶺に咲く花に喩えているというわけです。

<p class="correction_comment">I think there's a difference in nuance between "approached" and "approachable."  To me, (and full disclaimer, others may feel differently) "approachable" says something about the woman's character. Perhaps she is cold or standoffish. "Approached" says less about the woman and more about the feelings of the person thinking about her.</p>

 勉強になりました。It sounds like it can be used similarly to "to be out of my league"?

Thank you for the correction and detailed explanation! I understand the nuances well. :)<br/><br/>&gt; It sounds like it can be used similarly to "to be out of my league"?<br/>Yes! In most cases, I think 'takane no hana' (高嶺の花) can be translated to "to be out of one's league" in English.
