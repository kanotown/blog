<div class="date">Aug 11, 2015 10:27</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Japan, even if you lost your wallet, camera, or iPhone, there would be a very good chance that they will be found.<br/><br/>I think many Japanese people are willing to deliver such lost properties.<br/><br/>When I was young, I lost my wallet.<br/><br/>I felt sorrow, and cried, but immediately got a phone call from a police box.<br/><br/>"Did you lost your wallet?"<br/><br/>I was so happy, and at that moment, I vowed that I deliver lost properties when I find them.

 That's a really good promise. I try to keep that promise in the United states as well...but more often than not things are not returned to me... :(
 <br/>
 I wish my countrymen were a little more considerate.

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>Yes, I want more people to have consideration. Actually, Japanese people often steal an umbrella. My umbrellas were stolen several times.. :(

Really?!! I didn't know umbrella theft was a thing in Japan!!! Actually I have my name and phone number taped to my umbrella because I keep forgetting it at different places... :P I was told it was not a good idea... but I already lost 6 umbrellas since coming to Japan last year. hahah.

<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
Six?! Oh, I'm sorry. It is difficult to determine whether the umbrella is a lost item or not. Also, if it begins to rain, many umbrella will be purchased, and most of them will be left(discarded) in various places. Unfortunately, I think many Japanese downplay umbrellas, so there is little chance that they will be returned.
