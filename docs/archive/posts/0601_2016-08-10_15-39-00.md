<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese phrase "fu ni ochinai."<br/><br/>"Fu" means "guts," "ochinai" means "it doesn't fall," and "fu ni ochinai" means "be dissatisfied" or "can't understand."<br/><br/>Since "fu" was thought of as a place where thoughts and minds dwell, we have come to say "fu ni ochinai" (it doesn't fall in my gut) as the above meanings.<br/><br/>Although there is a positive version "fu ni ochiru," which means "I'm satisfied" or "I understand," this is rarely used in recent years.<br/><br/>There are many Japanese phrases that are mainly used with a negative expression like "fu ni ochinai."

腑に落ちない<br/><br/>今日は「腑に落ちない」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「腑」は「はらわた」のことであり、「腑に落ちない」は「納得がいかない」「合点がいかない」などの意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>「腑」は考えや心が宿るところと考えられていたため、他人の意見が心に入ってこないことを、腑に落ちないと表現するようになりました。<br/><br/>「納得がいく」という意味で「腑に落ちる」という表現もありますが、最近ではほとんど使われなくなってしまいました。<br/><br/>日本語には、このように主に否定でしか使われない表現が多く存在します。
