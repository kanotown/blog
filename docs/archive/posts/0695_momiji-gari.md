# 【No. 0695】<strong><em>Momiji Gari</em></strong> (To View Autumn Leaves)
<div class="date">Nov 12, 2016 13:14</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "momiji gari."<br/><br/>"Momiji" means "autumn leaves," "gari" means "to hunt," and this phrase means to visit mountains for viewing autumn leaves.<br/><br/>"Gari (karu)" was originally used to mean to hunt beasts or birds in fields or mountains.<br/><br/>This meaning expanded, and it came to mean to go to fields or mountains for taking something.<br/><br/>Foe example, you can say something like "kinoko gari" (mushroom hunting) or "ichigo gari" (strawberry hunting).<br/>(I heard that "mushroom hunting" is popular in Europe countries.)<br/><br/>Furthermore, currently "gari" comes to be used for "autumn leaves" to mean "to view autumn leaves."

紅葉狩り<br/><br/>今日は日本語の言葉「紅葉狩り」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「紅葉狩り」は「紅葉を見に山野をたずねること」を意味します。<br/><br/>「狩る」はもともと山野で獣や鳥などを捕える意味で用いられました。<br/><br/>この意味が広がり、「何かを摂りに山野へ行くこと」を表すようにもなりました。<br/><br/>例えば「きのこ狩り」や「いちご狩り」のように使われます。<br/>（「きのこ狩り」はヨーロッパで一般的のようです。）<br/><br/>さらに現在では、「狩り」は「紅葉を眺めること」に対してもが使われるようになりました。

 This was interesting to read! Where I live, we don't really have autumn - I would love to view  autumn leaves. :))
 <br/>

 We just have kind-of-not-hot weather, and HOT weather. :(

Thank you very much for correcting my post!<br/>Differences in weather/season between countries are interesting :)<br/><br/>By the way, now (November) is the best time to see autumn leaves in Japan.
