<div class="date" hidden>Sep 30, 2018 19:49</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Ippai Kuwasu<br/><br/>We sometimes use the phrase 'ippai kuwasu' to mean to deceive someone well.<br/><br/>'Ipppai' (一杯) means "a cup of something" or "a bowl of something," and 'kuwasu' (食わす) means "to feed someone" or "to have someone eat." <br/><br/>That is to say, the literal meaning of ippai kuwasu is "to feed someone to a bowl of something" or "to have someone eat a bowl of something."<br/><br/>According to the Internet, kuwasu can mean 'damasu' (騙す - "deceive"), but I could not find the detailed etymology.<br/><br/>Some people think that it comes from an old Japanese tale that a raccoon dog had a person eat a bowl of fake rice.
