# 【No. 1308】<strong><em>Himojī</strong></em> (ひもじい - Hungry)
<div class="date">Jul 18, 2018 23:17</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
If you are hungry and painful, you can express the feeling by using the Japanese <strong><em>himojī</em></strong> (ひもじい).<br/><br/>In the past in Japan, people thought that <strong><em>hizō</em></strong> (脾臓 - spleen) became sluggish when they were hungry.<br/><br/>Because of this, people call the feeling of hungry <strong><em>hidarui</em></strong> (ひだるい), which was made by combining two wrods: <strong><em>hizō</em></strong> (脾臓 - spleen) and <strong><em>darui</em></strong> (だるい - sluggish).<br/><br/>However, since to be hungry was shameful, people said <strong><em>himoji</em></strong> (ひ文字 - hi character) as a code word of 'hidarui.'<br/><br/>Later, <em>himoji</em> became the adjective 'himojī.'

ひもじい<br/><br/>お腹が空いてつらいことを、日本語で「ひもじい」と言います。<br/><br/>かつて日本では、お腹が空くと脾臓がだるくなるものと考えられていました。<br/><br/>このことから、「お腹が空くこと」を、「脾臓がだるい」という意味で「ひだるい」と言っていました。<br/><br/>しかし、空腹であることは恥ずかしいことであったため、「ひだるい」の代わりに「ひ文字」が隠語として使われたそうです。<br/><br/>後に、「ひ文字」が形容詞化して「ひもじい」となりました。

 Have you heard of the slang term "hangry"? It's a combination of "hungry" and "angry", when you're so hungry you start to get mad.
