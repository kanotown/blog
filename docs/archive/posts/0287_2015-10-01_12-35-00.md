# 【No. 0287】Sentences on my Homepage
<div class="date">Oct 1, 2015 12:35</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The following sentences will be posted on my homepage. I would like to create English version page, so I would appreciate it if you could correct my sentences.<br/><br/>These days, I write some sentences in English every day on a language exchange social networking website called Lang-8.  At first, I had mainly wrote my diary, but gradually what I write about was rolling away, and I began to write trivial things in English. Since the trivia has been piled up, I have a mind to post it in two languages (Japanese/English) for myself in my study. Although these sentences were corrected by native speakers, there might be some parts that the nuances are different or some minor mistakes. If you noticed these points, it is much appreciated if you could advise me.

以下の文は、私のホームページに載せている文章です。英語版も作りたいと考えているので、添削して頂けたら嬉しいです。<br/><br/>私は現在 lang-8 という添削サイトで、毎日英語で短い文章を書いています。始めのうちは日記が中心でしたが、いつからかネタが無くなり、ちょっとした雑学を英語で書くようになりました。書いたネタも大分たまってきたので、復讐を兼ねて、ここに2か国語（日本語/英語）で雑学を載せていこうと思います。一応ネイティブの方から添削済みの文章ではありますが、日本語とニュアンスが異なっていたり、細かいミスもあると思います。もしお気づきの点がございましたら、ご報告いただけますと幸いです。

 I always read the native version and it helps me to understand in a better way. Although, I couldn't understand these --&gt;  (いつからかネタが無くなり、) and (復讐を兼ねて) ^^?

Thank you very much always for correcting my post! :)<br/>&gt; What do you mean when you say 'rolling away' in this context ?<br/><br/>In this part, I wanted to say something like "fodders for my diary have gradually disappeared(decreased)."<br/>ここでは、私は「日記のネタ（日記に書く内容）が徐々に無くなっていった」といようなことを言いたかったです。<br/><br/>I used the phrase "roll away" as the meaning of something like "disappear" or "decrease."<br/>"roll away" は、"disappear" や "decrease" のような意味で使いました。<br/><br/>&gt; Although, I couldn't understand these --&gt; (いつからかネタが無くなり、) and (復讐を兼ねて) ^^?<br/><br/>"いつからか" is a shortened form of "いつからか（正確な時期はわからないが）." I heard "いつからか" means something like "at some point."<br/><br/>Also, "ネタ" means "fodders for my diary."<br/>また、ここで "ネタ" は "日記に書く内容" という意味です。<br/><br/>Therefore, I probably should have said "at some point, fodders for my diary have gradually disappeared."<br/><br/>&gt; 復讐を兼ねて<br/>Oops, I'm sorry. I made a mistake. This should be written as "復習を兼ねて."<br/>"復習（ふくしゅう）" means "review" or "brush up." <br/>"復讐（ふくしゅう）" means "revenge..."<br/><br/>Also, "～を兼ねる" means several meanings, but in this case, it means something like "combine with" or "double with" or "together with."<br/><br/>Sorry for the long comment! I wrote Japanese sentences at some parts (because I had no confidence in my English). I hope my sentences make sense.<br/>長文すみません！自信の無い部分は、日本語も一緒に書きました。意味が伝わることを願います。

説明、ありがとうございます：）I thought that 'fukushuu' was a specific phrase or something ^^;おそらく、あの「ふくしゅう」は特徴なフレーズだと思ってた。

Thank you very much for correcting my post again! :D<br/>&gt; What do you mean by this?<br/>In other words, I wanted to say something like:<br/>I would like to improve my English skill by writing (and reading) my old posts again in other places.<br/>I hope my English makes sense.
