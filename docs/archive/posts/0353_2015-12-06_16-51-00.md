手の温度<br/><br/>今日は、手の温度と人付き合いの関連性について学びました。<br/><br/>真実かどうかはわかりませんが、手のひらの温度が低い人は人付き合いが苦手な傾向にあるようです。<br/><br/>手が冷たくなる主な原因は血行不良で、緊張感の高い人や一生懸命な人に多いようです。<br/><br/>一方、手のひらの温度が高い人はリラックスしていて、社交的である傾向にあるようです。<br/><br/>ただし、手が暖かくても湿っている人は、内向的だとの報告もあります。<br/>（私はこのタイプです。）<br/><br/>日本人はあまり握手をしませんが、握手をすることで相手への効果的なアプローチの方法を選択することができます。
