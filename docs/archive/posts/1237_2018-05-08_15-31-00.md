# 【No. 1237】<strong><em>Tsume no Aka wo Senjite Nomu</strong></em> (爪の垢を煎じて飲む - Taking a Lesson from Someone)
<div class="date">May 8, 2018 15:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I think that many people want to model after an excellent person and become a person like him/her.<br/><br/>Such an act or thought is expressed as tsume no aka wo senjite nomu (爪の垢を煎じて飲む) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Tsume (爪) means "nail," aka (垢) means "grim" or "dirt," senjite (煎じて) means "to brew something," and nomu (飲む) means "to drink something."<br/><br/>Therefore, the literal meaning of this proverb is "to brew someone's nail jam and drink it," but of course we don't such a thing and there is no meaning to drink it.<br/><br/>This proverb represents the feeling that people want to approach and model after an excellent person even a little by extracting a part of the person and drinking it.

爪の垢を煎じて飲む<br/><br/>多くの人は、優れた人を模範とし、あやかりたいと思うものです。<br/><br/>その行為や考えを「爪の垢を煎じて飲む」ということわざで表現することがあります。<br/><br/>「爪」は "nail," 「垢」は "dirt," 「煎じて」は "to brew something" 「飲む」は "to drink something" を意味します。<br/><br/>文字通りの意味は "to drink" ですが、もちろん実際に飲むわけでもなく、飲んだところで意味もありません。<br/><br/>このことわざは、優れた人の成分を抽出して飲むことで、少しでもその人に近づきたいという気持ちを表しています。

 Wow, what an interesting proverb! If taken literally, it's like the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter, or something a witch in a fairy tale would do. Most English proverbs are about animals (you can lead a horse to water but can't make it drink, when pigs fly, ect), so hearing ones about humans from other cultures is always interesting.

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/>And thank you for letting me know such the interesting proverbs!<br/>Japanese also has a lot of proverbs related to animals, but I've never heard of them. It's really interesting. :)
