<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Tetsuya</strong></em> (徹夜 - All Night)</h1>
<div class="date">Jul 22, 2017 10:15</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Since yesterday was a deadline for a speech manuscript at an academic conference, I did "tetuya" (徹夜).<br/><br/>"Tetsuya" means to do activities such as work or entertainment all through the night without sleep.<br/><br/>"Tetsu" (徹) of "tetsuya" means to go/become through, and "ya" (夜) means night.<br/><br/>Therefore, "tetsuya" means to stay awake through the night.<br/><br/>If work goes well by doing tetsuya, you can receive a sense of accomplishment, but you will increase mistakes due to a lack of concentration, and you will be in bad physical condition, you should avoid doing tetsuya as much as possible.<br/><br/>Incidentally, young people often say "all" (ォール) instead of tetsuya.<br/><br/>"All" is short for "all night," and it is used as "All suru" (オールする - do all).

徹夜<br/><br/>昨日は学会に講演原稿の締切日だったため、私は「徹夜」しました。<br/><br/>「徹夜」とは、夜通しで睡眠をとらず、仕事や娯楽などの活動をすることを表します。<br/><br/>「徹」は貫きとおすことや徹底することを、「夜」はそのまま夜を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち「徹夜」とは、夜を貫きとおして起きているということです。<br/><br/>徹夜で仕事が成功すると達成感がありますが、集中力が欠けてミスが増え、体調不良にもなりやすいので、できるだけ避けたいです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、若者は徹夜のことを「オール」と言うことがあります。<br/><br/>「オール」は「オールナイト」の略で、「オールする」のように使われます。

 Yeah, all-nighters are impossible for me. I really can't concentrate at all when I'm sleepy. I'm a little jealous of people who can!

 Quite an interesting entry!
 <br/>

 I think I spent a quarter of my life doing "tetsuya" (T~T).
