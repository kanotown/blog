<p class="correction_comment">"As a last resort" means that you have tried other ways to fix the problem but was unsuccessful. So, it makes sense to write something about what you did to solve the problem before this sentence. :)</p>

 Here's one way of rewriting this:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I am currently in Washington D.C. for an academic conference and staying at a hotel near the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. This morning, I ran into a big problem: the toilet in my room got clogged up. I might have used too much toilet paper. I tried to fix the problem a few times but failed, and so I called the front desk and said, "Excuse me. My toilet is clogged up. Can someone come and fix it?". The clerk replied, "Okay." After waiting for quite some time, nobody came to fix the toilet. So I left $5 as a tip and headed to the conference venue. I should be more careful next time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Good job! :)
