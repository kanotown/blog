# 【No. 1121】<strong><em>Kutakuta and Hetoheto</em></strong> (「くたくた」と「へとへと」 - Exhausted)
<div class="date">Jan 12, 2018 16:36</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are Japanese onomatopoeia, くたくた (kutakuta) and へとへと (hetoheto),  both of which mean that someone is exhausted.<br/><br/>Both of kutakuta and hetoheto are often used in the same situation, but the degrees of tiredness that are expressed are different. <br/><br/>Kutakuta implies that you are tired, but you will get active if you take a little rest.<br/><br/>Hetoheto implies that you are exhausted, and it is difficult to you to not only move but also get up.<br/><br/>Also, kutakuta can be used to mean that things are shabby, but hetoheto is used to only people.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I'm now kutakuta.

「くたくた」と「へとへと」<br/><br/>日本語には疲れたことを意味する擬態語に、「くたくた」と「へとへと」があります。<br/><br/>どちらも似た状況でよく使われますが、表している「疲れ具合」が異なります。<br/><br/>「くたくた」は、疲れてはいるが、少し休めば動けるよるような状態を表します。<br/><br/>「へとへと」は、ひどく疲れ切って、立ち上がるのも困難な状態を表します。<br/><br/>また、「くたくた」は物が使い古された様子を表すこともできますが、「へとへと」は人に対してしか使えません。<br/><br/>ちなみに私は今、くたくたです。

I'm also feeling kutakuta right now. Hopefully this tea I'm about to drink will help.
