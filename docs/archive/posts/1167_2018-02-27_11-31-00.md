# <strong><em>Posharu</strong></em> (ポシャる - Falling Through)
<div class="date">Feb 27, 2018 11:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I introduced you to the Japanese term "ojan," which means that a plan or a thing goes up in smoke.<br/><br/>Today I'd like to talk about the slang term ポシャる (posharu), which has almost the same meaning of "ojan."<br/><br/>It is thought that "posharu" comes from the French word "chapeau," which means "hat."<br/><br/>By swapping the pronunciation of "chapeau" and adding the suffix る (ru) that can convert a noun into a verb, the verb "posharu" was created.<br/><br/>The reason why "posharu" has come to its current meaning is because taking off a 兜 (kabuto - helmet) meant giving up and people viewed the kabuto as the closest thing to a hat.

ポシャる<br/><br/>昨日は、計画などが途中で駄目になることを意味する「おじゃん」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>今日は、「おじゃん」とほぼ同じ意味で用いられる俗語「ポシャる」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ポシャる」は、フランス語で帽子を意味する「シャッポ (chapeau)」から来ていると考えられています。<br/><br/>「シャッポ」の前後を入れ替え、名詞を動詞化する接尾語「る」をつけることで、「ポシャる」となったというわけです。<br/><br/>現在の意味を持つようになったのは、日本では「兜を脱ぐ」が「降参する」ことを意味し、「兜」を「帽子」に見立てたためであると考えられます。
