<h1 id="subject_show">Ach so</h1>
<div class="date">Apr 21, 2015 22:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned the German phrase "ach so."<br/><br/>Interestingly, this phrase is pronounced "あっそう," and means "あっそう"  in Japanese.<br/><br/>Therefore, it was really easy for me to remember.<br/><br/>However, if we say "あっそう" in Japanese, this will give a bit rude impression.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this German phrase "ach so" is a very polite expression, so I think the Japanese phrase "あぁそうですね" is more appropriate than "あっそう."<br/><br/>Fine differences between nuances are scary to me.

今日、私はドイツ語のフレーズ「ach so」を学びました。<br/><br/>このフレーズは「あっそう」と読みますが、面白いことに日本語の「あっそう」と同じ意味です。<br/><br/>そのため、このフレーズは本当に覚えやすかったです。<br/><br/>しかし、日本語で「あっそう」と言うと、少し冷たい印象を与えます。<br/><br/>それに対してドイツ語の「ach so」は丁寧な表現なようなので、「あぁそうですね。」という日本語のほうが適しているかもしれません。<br/><br/>細かいニュアンスの違いは怖いです。

 Interesting. I studied German in the university for a couple of years and, to tell you the truth, it wasn't any fun )) Definitely not as fun as learning Japanese )

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>I think you're a wonderful person, because there are vastly differences among English and Russian and Japanese.
