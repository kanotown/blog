上高地<br/><br/>今日は友人と上高地に行く予定です。<br/><br/>上高地は、標高1500ｍ程の位置する、日本最大級の堆積平野です。<br/><br/>かつて、川が噴火活動によってがせき止められ池となり、そこに土砂が堆積してできたものと考えられています。<br/><br/>冬は非常に寒さが厳しく、1月の平均気温は-7.7℃、最低気温は-30℃以下になります。<br/><br/>一方夏は平均気温が20℃ほどとなり、とても涼しく気持ちよく観光できます。<br/><br/>ただし、一部地域は最暖月の平均気温が10℃を超えず、ツンドラ気候となっています。<br/><br/>もし長野県に来る機会があれば、是非訪れてみて下さい。
