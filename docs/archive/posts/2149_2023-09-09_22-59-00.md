# 【No. 2149】0-ji Machi (0時待ち - Waiting for Midnight)
<div class="date">Sep 9, 2023 22:59</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
0-ji Machi<br/><br/>Yesterday, I did '0-ji machi' (0時待ち - literally "waiting for 0 o'clock") at a highway service area.<br/><br/>On Japanese highways, tolls are discounted by 30% all day on holidays and from midnight to 4 a.m. on weekdays.<br/><br/>This discount applies to the entire section you traveled, if you drive on the highway even for a short period during the designated hours.<br/><br/>Therefore, just before midnight, transportation trucks often stop one after another in front of toll gates, causing traffic jams.<br/><br/>This is known as '0-ji machi', which has become a problem, especially on Tokyo's highways.

0時待ち<br/><br/>私は昨日、高速道路のサービスエリアで「0時待ち」をしました。<br/><br/>日本の高速道路では、休日の終日と平日の深夜0時～4時の時間帯は、高速料金が30%割引になります。<br/><br/>この割引は、ほんの少しでも該当の時間帯に高速を利用すると、利用区間全体が対象となるというものです。<br/><br/>そのため、0時を過ぎてから高速道路を降りようと、料金所の手前でトラックが次々に停車し、渋滞を作ることがあります。<br/><br/>これが「0時待ち」と呼ばれるもので、特に東京の高速道路で問題となっています。

 Wow, I'd never heard of that! How expensive are tolls in Japan?

Thank you for reading my entry!<br/><br/>&gt; How expensive are tolls in Japan?<br/>I use the highway for about 100 km for my commute, and the toll costs about 3,000 yen (about $20) for that distance. This seems to be a very high toll fee, even by global standards!
