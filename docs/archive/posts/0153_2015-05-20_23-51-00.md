<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I found a little claptrap quiz like following:<br/><br/>"Please rearrange "Airway Saneness" and make a sentence. The answer is easy."<br/><br/>I couldn't solve this problem, but the answer was "answer is easy."<br/><br/>The answer was included in the problem statement.<br/><br/>How frustrating!

今日は、次のような少し下らない問題を見つけました。<br/><br/>「Airway Saneness を並び替えて文章にして下さい。答えは簡単です。」<br/><br/>少し考えたけど答えがわからず、解答を見てみると「Answer is easy」でした。<br/><br/>問題文の中に答えが入っていたのです。<br/><br/>少し悔しかったです。
