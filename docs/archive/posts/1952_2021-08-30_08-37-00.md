# 【No. 1952】<strong><em>Omae Hyaku made Washa Kuju-ku made</strong></em> (お前百までわしゃ九十九まで - Till Death Do Us Part) Part 2
<div class="date">Aug 30, 2021 08:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Omae Hyaku made Washa Kuju-ku made</strong></em> Part 2<br/><br/>In this proverb, the husband is a hundred years old, whereas the wife is ninety-nine years old. There are two theories about the gap of one year.<br/><br/>One is that this is the wife's wish that her husband would not die before her.<br/><br/>The other is that the couple has an age gap of one year, and the wife wishes to meet her end with her husband at the same time.<br/><br/>Incidentally, this proverb was created around 1800, and Japanese people could only live to be 40-50 years old at this age.<br/><br/>Thus, taking into account modern life expectancy, this proverb might be <strong><em>omae ni-hyaku made washa hyaku kuju-ku made</em></strong> (お前二百までわしゃ百九十九まで - literally means "You live until two hundred, and I live until one hundred and ninety-nine").

お前百までわしゃ九十九まで Part 2<br/><br/>このことわざで、夫が100歳、妻が99歳と1歳だけずれていますが、その理由には二つの説があります。<br/><br/>一つは、妻が、夫に先に死なないで欲しいという願いを込めたというものです。<br/><br/>もう一つは、1歳年の差がある夫婦で、同時に最後を迎えたいという願いが込められているというものです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、この言葉が生まれたのは1800年頃で、日本人の寿命は40～50歳程度でした。<br/><br/>このため、この言葉を今風に言うと、「お前二百までわしゃ百九十九まで」となるのかもしれません。

Thank you for the correction!<br/><br/>&gt; while a 100 years is still feasible today, I dont know anyone who has lived till 200.<br/>Yes, this phrase is like saying, "Let's live the longest life in the world!"
