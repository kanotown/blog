<div class="date">Nov 15, 2017 12:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I like dogs, but many terms/idioms that use dog have negative meanings.<br/><br/>The idiom "kamase inu" (かませ犬), that I will introduce today, is one of them.<br/><br/>The "kamase" (かませ) means "to let someone bite," "inu" (犬) means "dog," and the combination means a weak dog that is prepared to be bitten by another dog in dog fighting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this weak dog (kamase inu) is just used to give a confidence to the fighting dog.<br/><br/>Because of this background, "kamase inu" is also used to mean a weak person who emphasizes a main character.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the top character of the kamase-inu ranking in anime is Yamcha of Dragon Ball.

かませ犬<br/><br/>私は犬が好きですが、犬を使った慣用句は否定的な意味を持つことが多いです。<br/><br/>今日の投稿で紹介する「かませ犬」もその一つです。<br/><br/>「かませ犬」の文字どおりの意味は「噛ませる犬」であり、闘犬において調教する犬に噛みつかせる弱い犬のことを意味します。<br/><br/>この弱い犬（かませ犬）は、闘犬の自信をつけるためだけにあてがわれます。<br/><br/>これが転じて、現在では主に、漫画や格闘技などで引き立て役として戦わせる弱い相手のことを表します。<br/><br/>ちなみに、アニメのかませ犬ランキングの一位は、ドラゴンボールの「ヤムチャ」です。

The idiom "kamase inu" (かませ犬), <span class="f_blue">which</span> I will introduce today, is one of them.
<p class="correction_comment">that vs which<br/>There are two different forms related to these words:<br/>- one uses "which" with commas - this adds non-essential information<br/>- the other uses which / that - this adds essential information<br/><br/>for example:<br/><br/>This is the tea that I like. O<br/>This is the tea which I like. △<br/>This tea, that I like, is very expensive. X<br/>This tea that I like is very expensive. O <br/>   (here, "that I like" is essential information. Maybe the speaker is comparing it with another tea?)<br/>This tea, which I like, is very expensive. O <br/>   (here, "which I like" is not essential information)<br/><br/>It's difficult to explain in writing here, but I hope that makes sense!</p>
