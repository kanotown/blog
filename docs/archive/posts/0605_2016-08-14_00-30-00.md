帰省と軽い観光 Part 2<br/><br/>今日は、昨日の投稿の続きを書きます。<br/><br/>帰省の途中で寄った二つ目の観光地は、うなぎパイファクトリーです。<br/><br/>うなぎパイはうなぎパウダーをパイ生地に練り込んだ洋菓子で、静岡のおみやげとして人気があります。<br/>（うなぎの味は全くしません。）<br/><br/>うなぎパイファクトリーでは、うなぎパイの製造工程を見学して、学ぶことができます。<br/><br/>とても短い工場見学でしたが、楽しかったです。<br/><br/>おみやげに大量のうなぎパイを買いました。<br/><br/>その後は実家に戻り、甥っ子と姪っ子と遊びました。<br/><br/>今日も沢山、彼らと遊んでくたくたです。

 Sounds like a fun trip! Do the pies taste good? Eel pies sound... interesting. Haha!

Thank you for the comment!<br/>Yes, the name might sound a little... eerie.<br/>However, it's just a sweet crispy pie :)

That sounds delicious! One day, I'd love to have the opportunity to try one. Perhaps I'll be able to, if I manage to get to Japan next summer.

 I love unagi and I think I would actually like a savoury unagi pie. ^.^;

Thank you very much for correcting my post!<br/>I like both of unagi and unagi pies, but they have completely different tastes. Please try it if you have a chance :)

I would definitely try it, if I get a chance to!
