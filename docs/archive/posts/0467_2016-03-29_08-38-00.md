# 【No. 0467】Right and Left [Part2]
<div class="date">Mar 29, 2016 08:38</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will write the rest of the yesterday's entry.<br/><br/>In Japan, when we receive a diploma in an award ceremony, we first hold out our left hands.<br/><br/>It is thought that the reason why we think that left is superior to right is because the sun rises from east.<br/><br/>However, since west can become both right and left depending on the observer's direction, I'm not sure whether or not this hypothesis is right.<br/><br/>By the way, many of Australia's indigenous languages don't seem to have words that correspond to "right" and "left."<br/><br/>They use "north," "south," "east" and "west" instead.

右と左 [Part2]<br/><br/>今日は、昨日の続きを書いていきます。<br/><br/>日本では、表彰式などで賞状を受け取る際、左手から添える風習があります。<br/><br/>日本人が左を優位とする理由は、太陽が東から昇るからとされています。<br/><br/>しかし、観測者の向きによって東は右にも左にもなるので、この説が正しいのがどうかよくわかりません。<br/><br/>ちなみに、オーストラリアの先住民の言語の多くは、右・左という単語が無いそうです。<br/><br/>彼らは代わりに、東西南北を使います。

 面白い！動画からオーストラリアの先住民の言語は左と右という単語がないことについて聞いたこともあります。
