# 【No. 1611】<strong><em>Koshikake</strong></em> (腰掛け - Chair/Makeshift Job)
<div class="date">May 17, 2019 18:41</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Koshikake</strong></em><br/><br/>People often use <strong><em>koshikake</em></strong> (腰掛け) when getting tired from walking or standing.<br/><br/><strong><em>Koshi</em></strong> (腰) means "lower back," and <strong><em>kake</em></strong> (掛け) has various meanings, but here it means "to place," so the literal meaning of <em>koshikake</em> is "something for placing one's lower back."<br/><br/>Of course, it literally means the furniture for placing one's lower back and resting -- that is, it is a chair.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it can also mean that someone temporarily assumes a position only until getting their desired position or job.<br/><br/>The latter meaning is often used for female employees who intend to quit the job and become housewives when getting married.

腰掛け<br/><br/>歩くことや立つことに疲れたら、よく「腰掛け」を使います。<br/><br/>「腰」は "lower back"、「掛け」は "to place" を意味するので、「腰掛け」の文字どおりの意味は "something for placing one's lower back" となります。<br/><br/>もちろん、文字どおり腰を掛けて休む台、すなわち「椅子」を意味することも多いです。<br/><br/>一方で、目指す地位や職に達するまでの間、一時的に別の地位や職に就くことを指して「腰掛け」と言うこともあります。<br/><br/>後者の意味での「腰掛け」は、結婚したら会社を辞めて専業主婦になるつもりの女性社会人に対して使われることが多いです。

People often use <span class="f_blue">something called</span> 'koshikake' (腰掛け) when getting tired from walking or standing.
<p class="correction_comment">I think this helps for clarity. I don't know if koshikake is a thing, a word, or a kind of medicine for fatigue. Saying "something called" lets me know that you are talking about an item.</p>

'Koshi' (腰) means "lower back," and 'kake' (掛け) has various meanings, but here it means "to place," so the literal meaning of 'koshikake' is "something for placing one's lower back <span class="f_blue">against</span>."
<p class="correction_comment">It sounds strange in English without a preposition. If it is a chair, I think "against" works.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">You used "their" in your last sentence. So I think this is better for consistancy with that idea.</p>
