ちょっかい<br/><br/>今日は「ちょっかい」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ちょっかい」は、横合いから手出しや干渉をすることや、たわむれに異性に手を出すことを意味します。<br/><br/>「ちょっ」は「ちょっと」、「かい」は「掻く」の意味で、もともとは猫などが片方の前足をちょっと出して、物をかき寄せる動作を表していました。<br/><br/>この動作が、戯れであったり、ただの確認のためであったりしたことから、余計な手出しをするという意味を持つようになりました。<br/><br/>「ちょっかいを出す」もしくは「ちょっかいをかける」のように使われます。

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/>&gt; "light heart"? is that a romantic person? Or a shy person?<br/>Here, I wanted to say something like "with no serious" or "casually."
