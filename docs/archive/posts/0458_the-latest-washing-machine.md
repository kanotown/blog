# 【No. 0458】The Latest Washing Machine
<div class="date">Mar 20, 2016 17:02</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I bought the latest model washing machine, and tried to install it in my apartment.<br/><br/>It is a drum-type washing machine, which can perform the laundry process from washing and drying automatically.<br/><br/>Since I wanted to stick to washing machines, I chose a high performance and expensive one among those that have been sold to public.<br/><br/>I couldn't pay for the machine in one payment, so I bought it on an installment plan.<br/><br/>I was so excited.<br/><br/>However, the door width to the washing room was too narrow to carry the washing machine.<br/><br/>I got depressed.<br/><br/>Today, I couldn't install it, but fortunately I found that the door is removable, so I will try to install it again at a later date.

最新型の洗濯機<br/><br/>今日は最新型の洗濯機を購入し、アパートに設置しようとしました。<br/><br/>洗濯から乾燥まで全自動で行ってくれる、ドラム式の洗濯機です。<br/><br/>洗濯機にはこだわりたかったので、一般向けに販売されている洗濯機の中で、もっとも高機能で高価なものを選びました。<br/><br/>一括で買う金銭的余裕はなかったので、分割払いで購入しました。<br/><br/>私はとても興奮していました。<br/><br/>しかし、アパートの洗濯機置き場への扉が狭く、洗濯機を運び入れることができませんでした。<br/><br/>とても落ち込みました。<br/><br/>今日は業者さんに帰ってもらいましたが、幸いにもアパートの扉が取り外せることがわかったので、後日再チャレンジしようと思います。

 I hope you enjoy your new washing machine!

 I'm surprised you can buy your own machine for an apartment.  We usually can't do that in the US.  Either the property owner has laundry facilities installed, or we have to go to a laundromat.

In Australia, each apartment even a studio apartment these days have a multi function washing machine/dryer.

Thank you very much for the correction and your comments!<br/>If machines were installed in advance, it would be useful, and become easier to move. In addition, if it can do both washing and drying, I'm very very happy.<br/><br/>However, in many apartments in Japan, only an installation place for a washing machine is prepared for each room, and we have to prepare own machine.<br/>I think that one of the reasons is because we do laundry almost every day / every other day .
