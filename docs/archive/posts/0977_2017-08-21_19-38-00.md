<h1 id="subject_show">Kuda wo Maku (管を巻く - Blathering)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Aug 21, 2017 19:38</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I'd like to talk about the Japanese idiom, "kuda wo maku" (管を巻く).<br/><br/>Here, the "kuda" (管) means a small spindle that is used in fiber spinning, and "maku" (巻く) means to wind something.<br/><br/>In fiber spinning, in order to make thread, fiber is wound to the kuda (spindle) by rotating the spinning wheel.<br/><br/>This act is called "kudamaki" (管巻き) or "kuda wo maku" (管を巻く).<br/><br/>The act called "kuda wo maku" and the sound from it are very monotonous, and it's similar to a drunk person who talks same things monotonously.<br/><br/>Because of this, "kuda wo maku" has come to mean that a drunk person talks nonsensical things monotonously and repeatedly.

管を巻く<br/><br/>今日は「管を巻く」という慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>ここで「管」は、紡績に使う糸を巻き付ける小さな軸のことを意味します。<br/><br/>紡績では、糸繰り車を回して、この管に糸を巻きつけます。<br/><br/>このことを、「管巻き」や「管を巻く」と言います。<br/><br/>管を巻く動作、およびその際に発する音はとても単調で、酒に酔った人が同じことを単調に繰り返し話す姿に似ています。<br/><br/>このことから、「管を巻く」は、酒によった人がわけのわからないことをくどくど言うことを意味するようになりました。

 I see! Is this idiom usually used more in novels? :)

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>I think that this idiom is used in novels. However, this term might be getting old, because I rarely find it in sentences written by young people and conversations of young people.

My pleasure!<br/><br/>I see. I guess I'll expect to see it more in Japanese literature then. ^^
