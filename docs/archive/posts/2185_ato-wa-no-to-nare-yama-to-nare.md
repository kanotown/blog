# 【No. 2185】<strong><em>Ato wa No to Nare Yama to Nare</strong></em> (後は野となれ山となれ - After Me the Deluge)
<div class="date">Oct 15, 2023 14:46</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Ato wa No to Nare Yama to Nare</strong></em><br/><br/>If you think, "as long as I can solve the problem at hand, I don't care about anything else," you can express the feeling with the proverb <strong><em>ato wa no to nare yama to nare</em></strong> (後は野となれ山となれ).<br/><br/><strong><em>Ato</em></strong> (後) means "after," <strong><em>no</em></strong> (野) means "field," <strong><em>nare</em></strong> (なれ) means "become," and <strong><em>yama</em></strong> (山) means "mountain." Therefore, the literal meaning of this proverb is, "after this, let it become a field or a mountain."<br/><br/>In other words, it means that it does not matter to you whether the place becomes a field or a mountain after you are gone.<br/><br/>This proverb is used to describe an irresponsible or resolute attitude.

後は野となれ山となれ<br/><br/>「目の前の問題さえ解決できれば、後はどうなっても構わない」という心情は、「後は野となれ山となれ」ということわざで表すことができます。<br/><br/>「後」は "after"、「野」は "field"、「なれ」は "become"、「山」は "mountain" を意味するので、このことわざの文字どおりの意味は "after this, let it become a field or a mountain" となります。<br/><br/>自分がいなくなった後は、その場所が野となっても山となっても、自分には関係がないということです。<br/><br/>投げやりで無責任な態度、または潔い態度のたとえとして利用されます。
