<h1 id="subject_show">Air Cleaner with Humidification Function</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Sep 27, 2015 12:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
This month, two friends stayed over at my apartment.<br/><br/>However, both of them said that their throats feel sore when they woke up.<br/><br/>Apparently, there seemed to be a lot of house dust in my room, and the room seemed to be too dry.<br/><br/>So yesterday, I bought an air cleaner with humidification function.<br/><br/>This includes a duct sensor, and I can see the amount of dust in my room.<br/><br/>At first, it said that the amount of dust is less in my room, but the sensor reacted when I started to clean my room, and the air cleaning function was boosted automatically.<br/><br/>I will clean up my room frequently to prevent visitors from damaging their throats.

加湿空気清浄機<br/><br/>今月、私は友人を2回家に泊めました。<br/><br/>しかし、泊まった友人はどちらも、朝起きると喉が痛いと言っていました。<br/><br/>どうやら、私の部屋はハウスダストが多く、かつ乾燥していたようでした。<br/><br/>そこで昨日、加湿空気清浄機を購入しました。<br/><br/>それにはホコリセンサーが内蔵されていて、部屋のホコリの量がわかります。<br/><br/>つけてみたら部屋の中のホコリは少ないと表示されましたが、部屋の掃除を始めるとセンサーが反応し、空気清浄機にターボがかかりました。<br/><br/>次に泊まった人が喉を痛めないように、こまめに掃除を頑張ります。

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>I bought a KC-E50 manufactured by SHARP (there are many other models depending on the room size). This is one of the most popular company in the fields of air cleaner and many other home appliances in Japan.
