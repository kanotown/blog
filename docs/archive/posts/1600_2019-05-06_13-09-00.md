# 【No. 1600】<strong><em>Monomi Yusan</strong></em> (物見遊山 - Sightseeing)
<div class="date">May 6, 2019 13:09</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Monomi Yusan</strong></em><br/><br/>I would like to do <strong><em>monomi yusan</em></strong> (物見遊山) sometimes.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>mono</em></strong> (物) means "thing," <strong><em>mi</em></strong> (見) means "to see," <strong><em>yu</em></strong> (遊) means "to play," and <strong><em>san</em></strong> (山) means "mountain," the literal meaning of the combination is "to see things and to play at mountains."<br/><br/><strong><em>Yusan</em></strong> (遊山) was originally a Buddhist term, which meant that a Zen monk who finished training moves to the next temple (mountain) while going around various places.<br/><br/>Later, <em>yusan</em> came to mean to go to mountains for playing, and <em>monomi yusan</em> came to mean to go to various places for sightseeing or playing.

物見遊山<br/><br/>たまには「物見遊山」したいものです。<br/><br/>「物」は "thing"、「見」は "to see"、「遊」は "to play"、「山」は "mountain" を意味するので、「物見遊山」の文字どおりの意味は "to see things and to play at mountains" となります。<br/><br/>「遊山」はもともと仏教用語で、修業を終えた僧が各地を巡りながら次の寺（山）に移動することを意味していました。<br/><br/>これが野山に遊びに行くという意味になり「物見遊山」は「気晴らしにいろいろなところに遊びに行くこと」を意味するようになったというわけです。
