# 【No. 0725】Ita ni Tsuku
<div class="date">Dec 12, 2016 00:41</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese idiom "ita ni tsuku."<br/><br/>"Ita ni tsuku" means that someone's attitude or behavior becomes to be suitable for his/her occupation or status.<br/><br/>Where "ita" means "a boarded stage", and "tsuku" means "to fit perfectly".<br/>(Normally, "ita" means just "a board".)<br/><br/>Since acting of experienced actors is match up precisely with the stage, such actors have been said "ita ni tsuiteiru" (you're fitting the boarded stage).<br/><br/>This phrase "ita ni tsuku" became to have the above meaning, moreover it became to express that clothes fit someone well.<br/><br/>By the way, as a result of searching for the English translation of it, an expression "to become natural to one" was found.

板につく<br/><br/>今日は「板につく」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「板につく」は、態度や振る舞いが、職業や地位にふさわしくなることを意味します。<br/><br/>ここで「板」は「板張りの舞台」のことを、「つく」は「ぴったり合うこと」を表しています。<br/><br/>経験を積んだ役者の芸は、舞台によく調和していることから、「板についている」と言われていました。<br/><br/>これが転じて上述のような意味になり、更には服装などがよく似合うという意味なども表すようになりました。<br/><br/>ちなみに「板につく」の英訳を調べると "to become natural to one" という表現が見つかりました。
