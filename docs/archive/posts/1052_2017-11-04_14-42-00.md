<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Naraku no Soko</strong></em> (奈落の底- Abyss)</h1>
<div class="date">Nov 4, 2017 14:42</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A severe situation that you can't  turn around is called "naraku no soko" (奈落の底) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "naraku" (奈落) comes from a Buddhism term (Sanskrit language), "naraka," which means "hell," and the "soko" (底) means "bottom."<br/>("Naraka" was translated into Chinese as "奈落" (naraku), and it has also come to be used in Japan.)<br/><br/>Therefore, "naraku no soko" originally means "the bottom of hell," and now it can mean "rock bottom" or "severe situation that you can't turn around."<br/><br/>For example, it's used as "naraku no soko ni ochiru" (奈落の底に落ちる - I fall into a bottomless pit).

奈落の底<br/><br/>抜け出すことのできない、どうにもならないような状態のことを、「奈落の底」と言います。<br/><br/>「奈落」は「地獄」を意味する仏教用語（サンスクリット語）の "naraka" から来ています。<br/>("Naraka" は中国語で「奈落」と訳され、これが日本でも使われるようになりました。)<br/><br/>そのため、「奈落の底」は本来「地獄の底」を意味しますが、これが転じて「物事のどん底」や「抜け出せないような状態」を意味するようにもなっています。<br/><br/>「奈落の底に落ちる」のように使われます。
