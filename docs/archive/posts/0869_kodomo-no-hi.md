<p class="correction_comment">The original sentence splices two independent clauses with a comma. You could make it into two sentences or use the "established in 1948" as an additional piece of information, separated out by commas.</p>

 A very well-written entry, with only a couple errors. Good job.

 So, am I interpreting correctly that it started to be only for boys and only later for children in general?

Thank you so much for correcting my post again!<br/>&gt; So, am I interpreting correctly that it started to be only for boys and only later for children in general?<br/>Under the Japanese laws concerning holidays, it's for children now. However, traditionally it has been for boys, and I think that most families celebrate mainly for boys even now. This is because there is a day (March 3) called "momo no sekki" (also called "hina matsuri"), which is for girls.
