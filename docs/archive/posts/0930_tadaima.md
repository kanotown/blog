# 【No. 0930】<strong><em>Tadaima</em></strong> (ただいま - I'm home)
<div class="date">Jul 5, 2017 08:25</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Japan, people often say "tadaima" (ただいま) when they arrive at their homes.<br/><br/>This is short for "tadaima kaerimashita" (ただいま帰りました), which is more polite and formal than saying just tadaima.<br/><br/>Here, "tada" means "just," "ima" means "now," and "kaerimashita" means "I'm home" or "I'm back."<br/><br/>Hence "tadaima kaerimashita" means "Just now I'm home," but somehow kaerimashita which means "I'm home" has come to be abbreviated and tadaima has come to have the same meaning as kaerimashita.<br/><br/>It might be derived from the fact that tadaima is easier to say or more approachable than kaerimashita.

ただいま<br/><br/>日本では、家に帰るときよく「ただいま」と言います。<br/><br/>これは、より丁寧で形式的な表現である「ただいま帰りました」を略した言葉です。<br/><br/>ここで、「ただいま」は "just now," 「帰りました」は "I'm home" や "I'm back" を意味します。<br/><br/>そのため、「ただいま帰りました」は "Just now I'm home" となりますが、なぜか I'm home を意味する帰りましたのほうが省略されるようになりました。<br/><br/>良いやすさや馴染みやすさによってこのようになったのかもしれません。

<p class="correction_comment">We abbreviate long things into shorter things.<br/>"Tadaima" does not now mean "kaerimashita," but implies/carries the meaning of "kaerimashita" in it. "Retains" is an appropriate word for this context where nuance is being discussed.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">The meaning of "it" is unclear, so the reader is most likely to read it as "this situation." Consequently, we cannot use "derived" here.</p>
