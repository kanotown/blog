When we want to use a bathroom, we often say "トイレを借りてもいいですか？（Can I borrow the toilet?）"<br/><br/>However, the verb "borrow" implies physically borrowing something from someone and that you must give back to it later, so it sounds strange.<br/><br/>I learned that we should to say something like the followings.<br/><br/>・Can I use the bathroom?<br/>・May I use the restroom/washroom? <br/>・I have to go the toilet.<br/>・I’d like to wash my hands.<br/>・I’m just going to use the loo.<br/>・May I inspect the geography of the building?<br/><br/>By the way, most restaurants and shops in Japan have a bathroom, and we can go there without asking.

<p class="correction_comment">What!? This is so funny! I have never heard anyone say this before. This is the BEST way to ask to go to the bathroom ever, lol, hahaha.<br/><br/>People might not know what you mean though. But if you say, "I have to inspect the geography of the building," it sounds like a good way to make an excuse to leave, while subtly making a joke that lets people know that you don't want them to know where you are going.</p>

Thank you very much for correcting my post and letting me know more natural expression! :D<br/>I also like the last phrase, haha.<br/><br/>On a website, this phrase was introduced as conversations of Englishmen, like following:<br/>Man : May I inspect the geography of the building?<br/>Waiter : Certainly. It’s down the hall on your right.

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/>I learned this phrase from a website. <br/>According to the website, in the UK, Englishmen who attending high society parties don't say directly something like "May I use the bathroom?" Instead, they often seems to use circumlocutory expressions.<br/>I think it is a kind of joke.
