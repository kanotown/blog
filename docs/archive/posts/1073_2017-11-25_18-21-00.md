# 【No. 1073】<strong><em>Iki ga Tsumaru</strong></em> (息が詰まる - Choking)
<div class="date">Nov 25, 2017 18:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Since today was a very important day for me that might determine my life, I was nervous and it was a little hard to breath.<br/><br/>Becoming such a situation is called "iki ga tsumaru" (息が詰まる) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "iki" (息) means "breath," the "tsumaru" (詰まる) means to "choke," and the combination "iki ga tsumaru" also means to "choke."<br/><br/>I don't think it necessary to explain the etymology of this term.<br/><br/>If you are very nervous or feel very stressed, you will choke sometimes.

息が詰まる<br/><br/>今日は私の人生を左右するかもしれない大事な日だったため、緊張で息苦しかったです。<br/><br/>このような状況になることを、日本語で「息が詰まる」と言います。<br/><br/>「息」は "breath," 「詰まる」は "to choke" を意味し、「息が詰まる」全体の意味としても "to choke" となります。<br/><br/>語源は説明するまでもなさそうです。<br/><br/>窒息しそうになるほど、緊張したりストレスを感じるということです。
