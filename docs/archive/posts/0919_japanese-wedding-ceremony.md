日本の結婚式<br/><br/>今日は、友人の結婚パーティに向かいます。<br/><br/>（もうへべれけにはならないように注意します。）<br/><br/>最近の日本では、結婚したカップルの約半数が、結婚式を挙げていないようです。<br/><br/>理由としてはお金がかかるから、準備が大変だから、などが多いです。<br/><br/>そして、上記の理由から、結婚式を挙げるカップルも親族だけの小さな結婚式にする傾向があります。<br/><br/>私の友人もそのようなカップルの一組で、今日は結婚式とは別に友人だけで楽しむ単なるパーティというわけです。<br/><br/>結婚式を挙げたカップルの約9割は挙げたことに満足していること、ほとんどの女性は結婚式に憧れていること、結婚式を挙げなかったカップルの約3割が離婚していることなどから、結婚式はしっかり検討したほうが良いかもしれません。

 &gt; about 30% of couples who didn't held a wedding ceremony divorced
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And among the ones that did held a wedding ceremony, what percentage divorced?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I ask this because 30% is pretty low rate of divorce.

I'm sorry, my information was wrong.<br/>The fact seems that about 30% of all Japanese couples divorce, and about 80% of the divorced couples don't hold a wedding ceremony. I wrote about it in my today's post, so if you have a time, please check it.

<div class="name"><span class="just_name">南蛮人</span><br>
Thank you for replying.<br/><br/>Yes, I'll look into it.<br/><br/>Still, 30% is pretty low...<br/><br/>Here, every year, for every 100 marriages there are 67 divorces.<br/>Nor exactly the same thing, but much higher.<br/><br/>Still one could argue that people just don't get married at all.

Oh, the divorce rate is really high..<br/>I thought that too many Japanese divorce, but Japanese couples seem to be relatively peaceful.
