# 【No. 0668】The Official Language of Japan
<div class="date">Oct 16, 2016 10:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Japanese language is commonly used in Japan.<br/><br/>However, the official languages of Japan is not defined explicitly under Japanese laws.<br/><br/>Of course, we learn Japanese language in school education, and official documents in Japan are written in Japanese, so it's practically a official language.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Angaur States of Republic of Palau defined Palauan, English, and Japanese language as its official languages. <br/><br/>The reason why that contains Japanese language is that Palau was a mandated territory of Japan.<br/><br/>Although only this region in the world defined Japanese language as the official language, there seems to be no people who can speak Japanese.

日本の公用語<br/><br/>日本では、日本語が一般的に用いられています。<br/><br/>しかし、実は日本の法律では、公用語については明示されていません。<br/><br/>もちろん、学校教育では「国語」で日本語を学び、公文書も日本語で書かれるため、事実上の公用語ではあります。<br/><br/>一方、パラオ共和国のアンガウル州は、公用語としてパラオ語、英語、そして日本語を定めています。<br/><br/>日本語が含まれている理由は、パラオは日本の委任統治領であったことに由来します。<br/><br/>この地域は世界で唯一日本語を公用語としていますが、現在島民の中で日本語を話せる人は一人もないようです。

 I see why you keep saying "Japanese language" but you don't need it every time - it's implied that you are talking about the language, rather than the culture. Just "Japanese" is fine in this case. :)

 Kind of like the USA, English is not the official language. At least to my knowledge.
