# 【No. 0881】Sake
<div class="date">May 17, 2017 13:02</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese word "sake."<br/><br/>"Sake" is a generic term for beverages that contain alcohol, and it often referred to as "osake" by attaching a polite prefix "o."<br/><br/>When saying "sake" in English, it usually means "Japanese sake," which is a kind of rice wine.<br/><br/>There are various theories about the etymology of "sake," but I will introduce the most accepted ones.<br/><br/>The theory says that "sa" is a prefix that fixes the rhythm of the word, and "ke" is the changed form of "ki," which was the old name of "sake."<br/><br/>Since I drank a lot of alcohol yesterday, I'm a little fluffy.

酒<br/><br/>今日は「酒」という単語について紹介します。<br/><br/>「酒」とは、アルコールが含まれた飲料の総称で、よく丁寧の接頭辞「お」を付けて「お酒」とも呼ばれます。<br/><br/>（英語で "sake" と言うと、「日本酒」を指すことが多いです。）<br/><br/>この言葉の成り立ちは諸説ありますが、その中で有力なものを一つ紹介します。<br/><br/>「さ」は語調を整える接頭語の「さ」で、「け」は酒の古名「き」が変化したという説です。<br/><br/>私は昨日、酒を沢山飲んだので、少しフラフラしています。
