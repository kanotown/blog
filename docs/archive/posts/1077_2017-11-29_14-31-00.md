# <strong><em>Oogesa</strong></em> (大げさ - Exaggerated)
<div class="date">Nov 29, 2017 14:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
If you make a grandiose claim or exaggerate something, you may be said "oogesa" (大げさ) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "oo" (大) means "big" and the "gesa/kesa" (げさ/けさ) means "Buddhist stole," so originally this term was used to mean a big Buddhist term.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there were Japanese terms: "ohokenashi" (おほけなし) and its changed form "ohogesa" (おほげさ), which mean "inordinate" or "bold."<br/><br/>Becaue of the meaning and the sound, "oogesa" has come to have the current meaning.

大げさ<br/><br/>物事を実際よりも誇張して見せることを、「大げさ」と言います。<br/><br/>「げさ/けさ」は僧侶の着る法衣「袈裟」のことであり、もともと「大げさ」は「大きな袈裟」を意味する言葉でした。<br/><br/>一方、「大それた」や「大胆な」といった意味を持つ「おほけなし」、およびそれの変化形「おほげさ」という言葉がありました。<br/><br/>この単語の音と意味から、「大げさ」は現在の意味を持つようになったと考えられています。

Thank you so much for correcting my post! <br/><br/>&gt; I don't understand what you're saying here. <br/>I'm sorry, I made a fatal mistake here. I wanted to say "a big Buddhist stole/robe" (just combining the previous terms) instead of "a big Buddhist term." I think your suggestion is more cool :)
