Today I learned AR (Augmented Reality) techniques and its implement way.<br/><br/>Actually, I implemented an AR program in the past, but I forgot it.<br/><br/>At that time I used C++ to implement it, but this time, I used Unity and C# in order to cut corners.<br/><br/>Someday, I would like to apply the AR technique  using X-ray CT in surgery.
