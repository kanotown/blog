<div class="date">Apr 20, 2017 08:54</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese term "kusawake."<br/><br/>"Kusawake" means to do something for the first time, or a person who start something as a pioneer.<br/><br/>"Kusa" of "kusawake" means "grass," "wake" means "to split," and this term originally means to develop villages or towns by clearing a grassy land.<br/><br/>Deriving from the meaning to develop a raw land, it came to mean to break into an unexplored field, or a founder/pioneer.<br/><br/>Also, there is a similar term, "so so," the literal meaning of which is "grass and create," and it means to start a new thing, or a beginning of things.<br/><br/>This term is often used as "so so ki," by attaching the word "ki," meaning "period."

草分け<br/><br/>今日は「草分け」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「草分け」は、何かを初めてすることや、何かを初めてした人（創始者）のことを指す言葉です。<br/><br/>この言葉の本来の意味は、草深い土地を切り開いて村や町を興すことです。<br/><br/>未開の土地を切り開くことから意味が派生し、未開の分野を切り開くことや、創始者の意味でも使われるようになりました。<br/><br/>また、何かを新しく始めることや、物事の始まりを意味する言葉に、「草創」があります。<br/><br/>この言葉は、時期を表す語である「期」を付けて、「草創期」と用いられることが多いです。
