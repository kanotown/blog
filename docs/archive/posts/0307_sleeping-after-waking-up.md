<div class="date">Oct 21, 2015 11:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I often go back to sleep after waking up.<br/><br/>It is thought that since going back to sleep become light sleep, and stimuli from outsides become mild, it feels good.<br/><br/>However, I actually want to get up early, so I searched for methods to prevent from it.<br/><br/>According to the Internet, it seems good to move your body forcibly and drink a glass of water.<br/><br/><br/>I will try to do this from tomorrow.

二度寝<br/><br/>私はよく二度寝してしまいます。<br/><br/>二度寝は眠りが浅くなるため、外部からの刺激がマイルドに感じられ、気持ちよいという説があります。<br/><br/>しかし、本当はちゃんと起きたいので、二度寝を防ぐ方法を調べました。<br/><br/>インターネットによると、無理やりにでも体を動かし、コップ一杯の水を飲むと良いそうです。<br/><br/>明日から実践してみます。

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :D<br/>&gt; I didn't realize マイルド was a Japanese word...A wasei-eigo word? What does it mean usually?<br/>"マイルド" could be a wasei-eigo word, but I think it's just a imported word, because it has the almost same as the meaning of "mild."<br/>We often use "マイルド" for food or flavors, like "マイルドなチーズ（a mild cheese）," "マイルドな香り（a mild flavor）." In this situation I wanted to mean "mild(mildly)" as something like "soft(softly)."

 I do that and it works! Only if you're motivated though. And once it becomes a routine, it becomes much easier. Good luck!
