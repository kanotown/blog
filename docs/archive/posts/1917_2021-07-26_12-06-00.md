<div class="date">Jul 26, 2021 12:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kame no Kō yori Toshi no Kō</strong></em><br/><br/>Elders' experience and knowledge are very valuable and should be respected.<br/><br/>The Japanese proverb <strong><em>kame no kō yori toshi no kō</em></strong> (亀の甲より年の功) expresses this fact.<br/><br/><strong><em>Kame</em></strong> (亀) means "turtle," the former <strong><em>kō</em></strong> (甲) means "shell," <strong><em>yori</em></strong> (より) means "more than," <strong><em>toshi</em></strong> (年) means "old," and the latter <strong><em>kō</em></strong> (功) means "rich experience" or "long years."<br/><br/>That is to say, the literal meaning of <em>kame no kō yori toshi no kō</em> is "(You should respect) elders' rich experience more than the turtle shell."<br/><br/>To tell you the truth, <strong><em>kame no kō</em></strong> (亀の甲) here was added for arranging the rhythm of this phrase, and it has any deep meaning.

亀の甲より年の功<br/><br/>年長者が積み重ねてきた経験や知識は、とても重要で、尊重するべきものです。<br/><br/>このことを表すことわざに、「亀の甲より年の功」があります。<br/><br/>「亀」は "turtle"、「甲」は "shell"、「より」は "more than"、「年」は "year"、「功」は "rich experience" や "long years" を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち、「亀の甲より年の功」の文字どおりの意味は、"(You should respect) elders' rich experience more than the turtle shell" （亀の甲羅よりも、長い年月で培った経験を尊重するべきである）となります。<br/><br/>ここで、「亀の甲」は「年の功」の語感を整えるために付け加えられたもので、深い意味はありません。

Thank you for the correction! :)<br/><br/>&gt; any would negate the meaning. like doesnt have any meaning.<br/><br/>Actually, I wanted to say something like, "turtle's shell was just added for the rhyming of this phrase, so there is no semantic relationship between the turtles' shell and the elders' experience, (that is, there is no deeper meaning)" here. Therefore, I probably should have said "there is no deeper meaning" or "it doesn't have any deep meaning."
