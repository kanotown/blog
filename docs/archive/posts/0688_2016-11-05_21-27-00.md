Today, I will talk about the Japanese proverb "ame futte ji katamaru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of this proverb is "the ground solidifies after a rainfall," and it expresses that a relationship would get better after a conflict or a trouble happened. <br/><br/>If it rains, the ground will become soft, and if the ground dries, it will be more firm than the initial state.<br/><br/>This phenomenon came to be used for human relationships.<br/><br/>There are also similar expressions in English: "After a storm comes a calm" and "After rain comes fair weather."<br/><br/>However, I'm not sure whether or not these English phrases are used mainly for human relationships like "ame futte ji katamaru."

雨降って地固まる<br/><br/>今日は「雨降って地固まる」ということわざを紹介します。<br/><br/>このことわざは、「けんかや揉め事があった後は、かえって良い状態になる」ということを表します。<br/><br/>雨が降った後にゆるんだ地盤が乾燥すれば、最初の状態よりも固くなります。<br/><br/>転じて、この現象は人間関係に用いられるようになりました。<br/><br/>英語では "After a storm comes a calm" (嵐の後に静けさが来る) や "After rain comes fair weather" (雨の後には晴れが来る) などと言います。<br/><br/>しかし、「雨降って地固まる」のように主として人間関係に使われている言葉かどうかはよくわかりません。

<p class="correction_comment">You don't need the "a" before rainfall but it's not technically wrong. Also "hardens" is better than "solidifies" <br/>"Trouble" doesn't translate well as a noun. You could use "hardship" or "fight" though, I think.<br/><br/>「rainfall」の前に「a」が必要じゃないですけれど、厳密に言えば不正解じゃありません。そして、「solidifies」より「hardens」のほうがいいです。<br/>「Trouble」は名詞としてうまく翻訳されません。しかし、「hardship」とか「fight」とか使えると思います。</p>

 You're English is pretty incredible, and thanks for teaching me that proverb!
 <br/>
 I tried to correct in both English and Japanese so I'm sorry if I made any mistakes.
 <br/>
 英語に素晴らしく上手で、そのことわずを教えてありがとうございます。
 <br/>
 日本語にも答えてみたから、見違えたならすみません。
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I don't think we use those sayings the same way but I think there's one that means the same thing. I can't remember it though
 <br/>
 そのことわずをそうで使わないと思うけれど同じの意味のことわずがあると思います。ですけどそれが頭に入っていません。

 Very interesting post again! :D Thank you for teaching us so much about proverbs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 You are right, those English phrases are not used mainly for relationships only. They can be used for anything. Relationship problems, financial problem, family problems, etc.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I bet we have a relationship-specific one in English, too, I just can't think of what it would be right now! :\
