# 【No. 0599】<strong><em>Aka no Tanin</strong></em> (A Complete Stranger)
<div class="date">Aug 8, 2016 19:30</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "aka no tanin."<br/><br/>"Aka" means "red," "tanin" means "a stranger," and "aka no tanin" means "a complete stranger."<br/><br/>Since the word "aka" comes from "akiraka," which means "obvious" or "clear," it contains such meanings in addition to "red," and is sometimes used for emphasizing a noun as in the above example.<br/><br/>(By the way, "kuro" (black) comes from "kurai," which means "dark.")<br/><br/>As similar examples, there are "makka na uso" (a red lie) and "aka ppaji" (a red shame).<br/><br/>"Makka na uso" means "an absolute lie" or "an utter lie," and "aka ppaji" means "a mortal shame" or "an open disgrace."

赤の他人<br/><br/>今日は、「赤の他人」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>赤の他人は、「完全に無関係な他人」を表す言葉であり、「他人」であることを強調しています。<br/><br/>「赤」は「明暗」の「明か」から来ており、「全くの」「明らかな」などの意味を有するため、この例のように名詞を強調する際に使われることがあります。<br/><br/>似た使用例として、「真っ赤な嘘」や「赤っ恥」という言葉もあります。<br/><br/>「真っ赤な嘘」は「完全な嘘」「明らかな嘘」を、「赤っ恥」は「ひどい恥」を意味します。
