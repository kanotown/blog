# 【No. 1401】Earthquakes in Japan
<div class="date">Oct 19, 2018 21:32</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Earthquakes in Japan<br/><br/>The surface of the earth is covered with 14 or 15 plate tectonics (also called "lithosphere"), and earthquakes occur when the strain on these plates is released.<br/><br/>Since Japan is placed on four tectonic plates, a lot of earthquakes occur compared with many other countries in the world.<br/><br/>The number of earthquakes including small earthquakes is about 5000 per year, and the number of earthquakes that you can feel the shaking is about 2000 per year.<br/><br/>This number seems to be second only to the one of Indonesia.<br/><br/>Incidentally, it is said that the country with the least natural disaster is Qatar.

日本の地震<br/><br/>地球の表面は、プレートと呼ばれる14〜15枚の岩盤で覆われており、このプレートのひずみが解放されるとき、地震が発生します。<br/><br/>日本のまわりは4枚のプレートが接しているため、世界的に見てもとても多くの地震が起こっています。<br/><br/>その数は、小さな地震も含めると年間約5000回であり、体感できるものでは約2000回だそうです。<br/><br/>この数は、インドネシアに次いで2番目に多いとのことです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、最も自然災害の発生件数が少ない国はカタールだそうです。

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/>&gt; I’ve thankfully never felt an earthquake before.<br/>Wow, that's good. I think that I feel an earthquake about once a month.
