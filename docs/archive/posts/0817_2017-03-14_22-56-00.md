# Heto Heto
<div class="date">Mar 14, 2017 22:56</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I participated in an academic conference.<br/><br/>Several students that I taught planned to do their poster presentations, and I planned to go the venue as an accompanying person of them.<br/><br/>However, two of them were absent, so I had to do poster presentations on behalf of them.<br/><br/>Since one poster session took one and a half hours, I explained their studies patiently for a total of three hours.<br/><br/>Now I am a state of "heto heto."<br/><br/>"Heto heto" is a term that means an exhausted condition,  but the etymology isn't clear.<br/><br/>A theory insists that "heto heto" comes from the last two characters of "i ro ha ni ho he to," which is a traditional Japanese poem called "Iroha Uta."

へとへと<br/><br/>今日は学会に参加してきました。<br/><br/>学生達がポスター発表をする予定で、私は付き添いのはずでした。<br/><br/>しかし当日、2名の学生が欠席したため、私が代わりにすることとなりました。<br/><br/>1つのセションが1時間半だったので、合計3時間、ひたすら研究の説明をしました。<br/><br/>へとへとです。<br/><br/>「へとへと」という言葉は、疲れ果てた状態を表す言葉ですが、語源ははっきりとはしていません。<br/><br/>ある説では、「いろはにほへと」の最後の2文字からきていると主張しています。

<p class="correction_comment">(in blue)<br/>You don't need to keep saying "poster" in front of "presentations" if it's been mentioned before.  Unless the presentations are different for the same set of people, you don't need to say that they're using posters because the readers already know.  It sounds redundant after a while.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">"took"<br/>In this case, you are talking generally so you have to use the present tense like it will always happen.</p>
