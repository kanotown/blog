# 【No. 0160】Collatz Conjecture
<div class="date">May 27, 2015 22:43</div>

Today, I wrote a program source of Collatz Conjecture.<br/><br/>Although this is one of the unsolved problems in number theory, it's very simple.<br/><br/>For all natural number n, think that you do the following.<br/><br/>・If n is even number, divide n by two.<br/><br/>・If n is odd number, multiply n by three and add one to the result.<br/><br/>It has been expected that n will always reach one in a finite trial.<br/><br/>This problem has not been solved from about 80 years ago.<br/><br/>By using computer, it was confirmed that this conjecture is correct until about 10^18, but it does not much make sense.<br/><br/>I hope it will be solved during my life.

今日は、コラッツの問題のプログラムを書きました。<br/><br/>これは数論における未解決問題の一つですが、とてもシンプルです。<br/><br/>全ての自然数 n に対して、以下の操作を行います。<br/><br/>・偶数ならば、2で割る。<br/><br/>・奇数ならば、3を乗じて1を足す。<br/><br/>そうすると、有限回の試行で必ず1に到達するという予想です。<br/><br/>この問題は、約80年解かれていません。<br/><br/>コンピュータで10^18乗くらいまでこの予想が正しいことが確認されていますが、コンピュータでの計算を繰り返しても意味がありません。<br/><br/>私が生きているうちに、解かれることを願っています。
