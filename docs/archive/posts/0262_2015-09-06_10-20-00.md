食事中のスマホ<br/><br/>日本の飲食店では、食事中にスマホをいじる人が本当に多くなりました。<br/><br/>たまにメールなどをチェックしているというわけではありません。<br/><br/>テーブルの上に常にスマホを置き、左手でスマホを操作しながら、右手でご飯を食べるのです。<br/><br/>皆さんはこの行動をどう思いますか？<br/><br/>私はあまり行儀が良くないと思います。<br/><br/>料理を作ってくれた人に失礼だと思いますし、複数人でお店に来ている場合は、来ている相手にも失礼だと思います。<br/><br/>また、衛生的にも良くなく、その姿勢も不格好に見えます。<br/><br/>家で一人で食べるときくらいは良いと思いますが、公共の場ではやめて欲しいです。

 Here's something I heard regarding the use of smartphones in restaurants.  Supposedly, more and more people are complaining that their meals are cold.  This could be because they spend so much time using their smartphones that they start eating later, and take longer to finish.

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :D<br/>And thank you for the interesting story. I also heard a similar story in Japan. Many Japanese people take meals pictures and upload it to SNSs before they eat. Some cooks want them to eat soon before the meals become cold.

 I have noticed that too! I try not use my phone when I am with my friends. The only time I use it during dinner time with them is to use my English-Japanese dictionary. But I will admit that when I am alone, I use my phone...but it's to study my flashcards on my applications. I never thought about how rude I might be to the cook. There are so few hours in the day to study........ I'm so sorry to everyone that I have been rude to.
