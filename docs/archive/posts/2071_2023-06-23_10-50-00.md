<div class="date">Jun 23, 2023 10:50</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Sode Furi-au mo Tashō no En</strong></em><br/><br/>In Japan, there is a belief that we should cherish every relationship, even a small one.<br/><br/>The proverb <strong><em>sode furi-au mo tashō no en</em></strong> (袖振り合うも他生の縁) expresses this belief.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>sode</em></strong> (袖) means "sleeve," <strong><em>furi-au</em></strong> (振り合う/触り合う) means "to touch each other," <strong><em>tashō</em></strong> (他生) means "previous/after life," and <strong><em>en</em></strong> (縁) means "fate/karma," the literal meaning of this proverb is "to touch sleeves each other is karma from a previous life."<br/><br/>In other words, this proverb says that we should cherish every encounter and relationship, no matter how trivial, because it is not by chance but karma from a previous life.

袖振り合うも他生の縁<br/><br/>日本には、知らない人との些細な関わりであっても、大切にしなさいという教えがあります。<br/><br/>このことは、「袖振り合うも他生の縁」ということわざで表されます。<br/><br/>「袖」は "sleeve"、「振り合う/触り合う」は "to touch each other"、「他生」は "previous/after life"、「縁」は "fate/karma" を意味するので、このことわざの文字どおりの意味は "to touch sleeves each other is karma from a previous life" となります。<br/><br/>すれ違いざまに袖が触れ合うような些細な関わりも、偶然ではなく前世からの因縁によるものであるので、どんな出会いも大切にしなさいということです。
