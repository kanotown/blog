# 【No. 0623】An Academic Conference and My Birthday
<div class="date">Sep 1, 2016 23:39</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I came to Wakayama Prefecture to participate in an academic conference and perform my research presentation.<br/><br/>The presentation ended peacefully and I was fun meeting my mentor after all this time.<br/><br/>And today was my birthday.<br/><br/>There were no particular celebrations, and I had much work to do.<br/><br/>By the way, I decided to present a [my first name].ac domain to myself as my birthday present.<br/><br/>Since an ac domain looks like an academic website, I wanted to get it for a long time. <br/><br/>The actual meaning of the ac domain is Ascension Island of British, but I don't care a damn.

学会と誕生日<br/><br/>今日は学会発表のため、和歌山県に来ています。<br/><br/>発表は無事終わり、久しぶりにかつての先生にも会えて楽しかったです。<br/><br/>そして今日は、私の誕生日でもあります。<br/><br/>特にお祝いなどはなく、仕事が山積みです。<br/><br/>私は自分自身へのプレゼントとして、私の苗字.ac のドメインをプレゼントすることにしました。<br/><br/>acドメインは、アカデミックのように見えるから、欲しいと思っていました。<br/><br/>実際はイギリス領アセンション島に割り当てられたドメインですが、気にしません。
