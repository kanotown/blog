オタサーの姫<br/><br/>昨日は多くの男性の中にただ一人いる女性を表す「紅一点」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>今日は、それと似た意味を持つ俗語「オタサーの姫」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「オタサー」は大学等における「オタクのサークル」の略、姫は "princess" を意味します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、男性の割合が多い文化系のサークル、特にオタクが集まるサークルにいる、数少ない女性メンバのことを指します。<br/><br/>このようなサークルにいる数少ない女性メンバは希少であり、男性メンバから「姫」扱いされることから、「オタサーの姫」と呼ばれるようになりました。

 サークル is a Japanese rendition of the English word "circle," right?

Thank you so much for the correction! :)<br/>Yes, サークル comes from the English word "circle."

 what if the girl isn't good looking?
</p>

</div><div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
In most cases in Japanese nerds' club, even if the girl isn't good looking, male members treat her as if she is a princess. Because of this, the term オタサーの姫 is sometimes used as an offensive word to imply that she isn't very good looking.

Thanks, I thought that might be the case. It’s a rather sad culture.
