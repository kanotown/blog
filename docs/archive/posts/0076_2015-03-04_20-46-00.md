# 【No. 0076】Foie Gras
<div class="date">Mar 4, 2015 20:46</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Today, I went to a ramen shop with my juniors. Surprisingly, foie gras bowl was sold at the ramen shop. The shop offers only 5 little foie gras bowls per day, and 4 bowls were already sold at that time. Therefore, I ordered the foie gras bowl and ate foie gras for the first time in forever. The name of the menu was "foie gras bowl," but in fact, there were only one small slice of foie gras and some slices of beef on a rice bowl. The foie gras is maybe very delicious, but it's difficult for me to describe the taste. I thought cheap meats are more suit me than expensive meats because I want to eat a lot of meat.

Thank you very much for correcting me! :)<br/><br/>I have one question.<br/>I used the word "only," but I wanted to mean like "one slice of foie gras and some slices of beef were on a rice bowl." I thought "one ... and some ..." are multiple objects, but should I use the word "was" instead of "were"?
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name"></span><br>
You should is "was" if the first thing listed is singular and use "were" if the first thing was plural.<br/><br/>*There was one slice of foie gras and some slices of beef.<br/>*There were some slices of beef and one slice of foie gras.

<p class="correction_comment">This "a" is a little hard to explain, and like many native speakers I don't have a good way to explicitly explain my intuition about this very confusing part of English. The best I can do is leave some examples.<br/><br/>Correct:<br/>That restaurant serves foie gras. (type of food)<br/>That restaurant serves hamburger. (type of food)<br/>That restaurant serves a foie gras dish. (specific item that the restaurant offers)<br/>That restaurant serves an amazing foie gras dish. (specific item that the restaurant offers)<br/><br/>Incorrect: That restaurant serves fois gras dish.<br/><br/>The previous corrector probably missed this because in America it's kind of uncommon for restaurants to sell meals as "bowls," as that's kind of a Japanese cultural phenomenon. But the same logic applies. The categorization I came up with for "type of food" and "specific item" is something that I just came up with and have not stress-tested for border cases, but I think it holds true. I think as with all things the best thing to do is keep reading examples from native sources!</p>

<p class="correction_comment">I use "so" here because you didn't really give a rigorous reason for choosing the bowl -- it was kind of implied (you wanted to get the bowl because it was the last one), and so "therefore" is a little strong. But it would probably be fine the way you had it, too.</p>

Thank you so much for your thoughtful corrections and comments! (^^)<br/><br/>I learned the difference between "type of something" and "specific item." I think the foie gras bowl is a specific item that the shop offers indeed. However, for example, beef bowl is very common dish in Japan and there are a lot of restaurant that offers beef bowl, and I think beef bowl is a type of food. In this case, can I say something like "That restaurant serves beef bowl?"<br/><br/>&gt; I like foie gras, but some people think it's disgusting!<br/><br/>Yes, I heard some people don't like the taste and some people think it's cruel. If anything, I like foie gras, but I don't like its price. It's too luxury for me!

笑　そうですね！In this case, I would say "That restaurant serves beef bowls." Using the plural is more natural to me. Your English is superb! This is a very illogical aspect of the English language.
