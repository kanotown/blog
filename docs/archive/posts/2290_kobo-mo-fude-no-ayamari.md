<strong><em>Kōbō mo Fude no Ayamari</em></strong>: Part 2<br/><br/>The Japanese proverb <strong><em>Kōbō mo fude no ayamari</em></strong> (弘法も筆の誤り) originates from the following anecdote:<br/><br/>One day, Kūkai (空海; also known as Kōbō) was requested to write characters on a plaque for the Ōtenmon (應天門) gate in Kyoto.<br/><br/>However, when the completed plaque was displayed, people found that the first stroke of the character <strong><em>Ō</em></strong> (應)  was missing.<br/><br/>This incident is believed to be the origin of the proverb <em>Kō bo mo fude no ayamari</em>.<br/><br/>It is also said that Kūkai later threw the brush from beneath the gate and successfully added the missing stroke.

弘法も筆の誤り Part 2<br/><br/>「弘法も筆の誤り」ということわざは、ある逸話に由来します。<br/><br/>空海（弘法）は、京都の應天門に掲げる扁額に、文字を入れるよう依頼されました。<br/><br/>しかし、掲げられた扁額を見ると、「應」の文字の一画目が書かれていなかったそうです。<br/><br/>これが、「弘法も筆の誤り」ということわざの由来とされています。<br/><br/>空海はその後、門の下から筆を投げつけ、見事に点を打ったとも言われています。
