Today I would like to talk about the Japanese common word "互角 (gokaku)."<br/><br/>"互 (go)" means "each other," "角 (kaku)" means "horn," and "互角" means that there is almost no difference among two, and it's difficult to decide the winning or the losing.<br/><br/>Actually, this word was originally written as "牛角 (gokaku)," the literal meaning of "牛" is "bull."<br/><br/>As the name indicates, the word "牛角" was derived from "bull's horns."<br/><br/>The thing is, left and right horns of a bull have almost the same length and size, so "牛角" came to mean something like "equivalent."<br/><br/>Note that the other kanji "互角" has been used since the Muromachi period, and "牛角" is no longer used now. <br/><br/>If you write as "牛角," it will be read as "gyu kaku" in most cases, which indicates a kind of Japanese yakiniku (roasted meat) restaurants.

互角<br/><br/>今日は「互角」という日本の一般的な単語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「互角」は、互いの力量に差がなく、優劣をつけにくいことを意味します。<br/><br/>この言葉はもともと「牛角」と表記されており、文字通り「牛の角」に由来します。<br/><br/>牛の角は左右ともに、長短・大小の差がないため、「牛角」と書いて「同等」という意味を持つようになったというわけです。<br/><br/>室町時代以降に「互角」という漢字が使われるようになり、現在では「同等」の意味で「牛角」は使われません。<br/><br/>現代の日本で「牛角」と書くと、それはほとんどの場合、焼肉レストランチェーンの「牛角（ぎゅうかく）」を指すことになります。
