# 【No. 1165】<strong><em>Unagi Nobori</strong></em> (うなぎのぼり - Spiral Rise)
<div class="date">Feb 25, 2018 13:47</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
When something such as price or status rises rapidly, we express the phenomenon by using the metaphor, うなぎのぼり (unagi nobori).<br/><br/>うなぎ (unagi) means "eel" and のぼり "nobori" means "to rise," so the literal meaning of "uangi nobori" is "an eel rises."<br/><br/>The most accepted theory about its etymology comes from the fact that since the bodies of eels are slimy, even if you try to grab them, they keep rising while slipping through your hands.<br/><br/>Also, there is another theory, which comes from the fact that eels can ascend rapid streams.<br/><br/>However, if this theory would be right, I think that "salmon" would be more appropriate than "eel."

うなぎのぼり<br/><br/>物価や地位など、何かが急速に上昇していくことを、日本語で「うなぎのぼり」と表現することがあります。<br/><br/>「うなぎ」は "eel," 「のぼり」は "to rise" を意味します。<br/><br/>語源はとしては、うなぎの体はぬるぬるしていて、掴もうとしても上に登るばかりだからという説が有力です。<br/><br/>語源にはもう一つ、うなぎは急流でもさかのぼることができるから、という説もあります。<br/><br/>しかし、その場合は「うなぎ」ではなく「鮭」を使ったほうが的確かもしれません。

 That's very interesting! I remember hearing a joke with うなぎのぼり and not getting it when I saw it. Now I totally understand it though!
