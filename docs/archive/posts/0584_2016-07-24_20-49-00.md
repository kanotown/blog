# 【No. 0584】Semishigure
<div class="date">Jul 24, 2016 20:49</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Recently, songs of evening cicadas (which are called higurashi in Japan) have come to resound in my university.<br/><br/>Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese phrase "semishigure," which expresses songs of cicadas.<br/><br/>"Semi" means "cicadas," "shigure" means "a drizzling rain," and "semishigure" is a phrase that likens songs of cicadas to sounds of the drizzling rain. <br/><br/>I think that this phrase has an attractive atmosphere compared to saying just "a buzz of cicadas" or "a chorus of cicadas."<br/><br/>This phrase expressed not only sounds but also a scene of summer.<br/><br/>I especially like semishigure by higurashi, and somehow it makes me want to cry.

蝉時雨<br/><br/>最近、ヒグラシの鳴き声が大学に響くようになりました。<br/><br/>今日は、蝉の鳴き声を表す表現「蝉時雨」を紹介します。<br/><br/>蝉時雨は、たくさんの蝉が鳴いているようすを、時雨の降る音にたとえて表現した言葉です。<br/><br/>ただ単に「大量の蝉の鳴き声」や「蝉の大合唱」と表現するよりも風情があると思います。<br/><br/>また、この言葉は音だけでなく夏の情景も表しています。<br/><br/>私は特に、ヒグラシの蝉時雨が好きで、聞いていると何故だか泣きそうになります。

 Thanks once again for introducing all these beautiful Japanese expressions! I understand what you want to say completely. You express yourself very well and I like how you use phrases like "that likens songs of cicadas to sounds of the drizzling rain", "this phrase has an attractive atmosphere". ^_^
