# Suppokasu
<div class="date">Apr 7, 2017 12:32</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese verb "suppokasu."<br/><br/>"Suppokasu" means to break an appointment or leave a work that you should do.<br/><br/>Usage example: Date no yakusoku wo suppokasareta. (I was stood up/My date didn't show up.)<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "su" of "suppokasu" is natural, real, or original, and it has a role to strengthen its following words.<br/><br/>"Pokasu" of "suppokasu" comes from "hokasu," which means "to leave something" or "to discard something."<br/><br/>According to my dictionary, "suppokasu" can be translated into "stand someone up" or "blow the appointment with someone."<br/><br/>Please don't do "suppokashi" ("suppokashi" is the noun form of "suppokasu.")

すっぽかす<br/><br/>今日は「すっぽかす」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「すっぽかす」は、約束や仕事などの自分がすべきことをせずに、放っておくことを意味します。<br/><br/>使用例：デートの約束をすっぽかされた。<br/><br/>「すっ」は漢字で「素っ」であり、言葉の前についてその意味を強める働きを持ちます。<br/><br/>「ぽかす」は「放っておく」や「捨てる」の意味を持つ「放す（ほかす）」の音が変化したものです。<br/><br/>私の辞書によると、「すっぽかす」は英語で "stand someone up" や "blow the appointment with someone" と言うようです。<br/><br/>
