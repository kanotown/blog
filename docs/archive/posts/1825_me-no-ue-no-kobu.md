<div class="date">Apr 25, 2021 15:04</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Me no Ue no Kobu</strong></em><br/><br/>There are people and things called <strong><em>me no ue no kobu</em></strong> (目の上の瘤) in human society.<br/><br/><strong><em>Me</em></strong> (目) means "eye," <strong><em>ue</em></strong> (上) means "upper," and <strong><em>kobu</em></strong> (瘤) means "bump," so the literal meaning of <em>me no ue no kobu</em> is "a bump on the upper side of one's eye."<br/><br/>If a bump is on the upper side of your eye, it will always in your sight and interfere with your work.<br/><br/>Because of this, <em>me no ue no kobu</em> refers to people or things that are disturbing.<br/><br/>In addition, since the bump in this idiom is the upper side of one's eye, it is often used for superiors, elders, and betters.

目の上の瘤<br/><br/>社会には、「目の上の瘤」と呼ばれる人やものが存在します。<br/><br/>「目」は "eye"、「上」は "upper"、「瘤」は "bump" を意味するので、「目の上の瘤」の文字どおりの意味は "a bump on the upper side of one's eye" となります。<br/><br/>目の上に瘤があると、いつでも視界に入り、何をするにしても邪魔になります。<br/><br/>このことから「目の上の瘤」は、邪魔であったり目障りである人やもののことを指します。<br/><br/>上側の瘤であることから、自分よりも地位が上の人に対して使われることが多いです。<br/><br/>また、「瘤」の代わりに「たんこぶ」とが使われることもあります。
