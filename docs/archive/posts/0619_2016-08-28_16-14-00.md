# Japanese Language Proficiency Test and The Japanese Language Examination
<div class="date">Aug 28, 2016 16:14</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I tried to solve exam problems of Japanese language on the Internet.<br/><br/>However, I made one mistake among five problems in the second grades.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe that foreign people trying to take N2 solve such difficult problems, but it was not "Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT)," but "The Japanese Language Examination" for native Japanese people.<br/><br/>To be honest, I'm relieved.<br/><br/>By the way, the problem that I made a mistake is related to "閑話休題 (kanwa kyudai)."<br/><br/>"閑話" means "digression," "休題" means "to stop the topic," and "閑話休題" means "to return to the main topic from the digression," which is translated as "but I digress" in English.<br/><br/>However, I thought that "閑話休題" means "to stray from the main topic and make a digression," which is something like "by the way" or "as an aside."<br/><br/>I heard that many Japanese people have misunderstood as I did, but I'd like to be more careful.

日本語能力試験と日本語検定<br/><br/>今日は、ネット上で日本語の試験問題を解いてみました。<br/><br/>しかし、2級の問題に5問挑戦したところ、1問間違えてしまいました。<br/><br/>はじめは「N2を受験している人たちはこんな難しい問題を解いているのか」と焦りましたが、私が解いたのは「日本語能力試験」ではなく日本人向けの「日本語検定」というものでした。<br/><br/>正直、少し安心しました。<br/><br/>ちなみに、私が間違えた問題は「閑話休題」に関するものです。<br/><br/>「閑話」は「無駄話」、「休題」は「話題をやめること」であり、「閑話休題」は「話を本筋に戻す」ことを意味し、接続詞のように使われます。<br/><br/>しかし、私は「現在の話題から外れて余談をすること」、すなわち「余談ではありますが、」のような意味だと勘違いしていました。<br/><br/>私と同じ勘違いをしている日本人も多いようですが、気をつけたいです。
