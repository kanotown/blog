LINE絵文字をリリース<br/><br/>私はときどきLang-8で投稿したトピックについて、4コマ漫画を描いています。<br/><br/>そのときに登場するキャラクター「ちくわ君」の絵が増えてきたので、LINE絵文字を作成し、リリースしました。<br/><br/>絵文字のサイズに調整するのは思いの外難しく、結局ほとんどすべての絵を描き直すことになり、かなりの時間がかかりました。<br/><br/>最終的には自分なりに納得のいく絵文字ができて、満足しています。<br/><br/>無料で公開したかったのですが、それはLINEの規約的に不可能でした。<br/><br/>もしよかったら、以下のURLからちくわ君の絵文字をチェックしてみてください。<br/><br/><a href="https://store.line.me/emojishop/product/6508060222c545010728ce88/ja" target="_blank">https://store.line.me/emojishop/product/6508060222c545010728ce88/ja</a>

 Interesting, I'm working on a similar project but don't expect to see a lot of revenue for it.
