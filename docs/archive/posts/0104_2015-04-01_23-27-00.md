エイプリルフールのルール<br/><br/>今日は日本では新学期の始まりで、新しいメンバが研究室に入ってきました。<br/><br/>そして、今日は嘘をついても良いとされるエイプリルフールの日ですが、私の周りで嘘をついている人は誰もいませんでした。<br/><br/>ところで皆さんは、エイプリルフールのルールを知っていますか？<br/><br/>エイプリルフールで嘘をついていいのは、4月1日の午前中までというものです。<br/><br/>このルールは、近年日本で毎年のように出回る嘘です。はは。<br/><br/>しかしこのルール、完全に嘘というわけではないようです。<br/><br/>イギリスやオーストラリア、南アフリカなどでは、実際に嘘は午前中というルールが浸透していると聞きました（これは多分、本当だと思います）。<br/><br/>イギリスではオークアップルデーという王政復古の記念日があり、午前中だけオークアップルの実を身に着ける風習があります。<br/><br/>これがエイプリルフールにも影響したとされています。<br/><br/>今のところアメリカ、ロシア、フランス、日本などでは一日中嘘をついてよいというのが一般的ですが、もしかすると将来的には「午前中のみ」のルールが浸透するかもしれません。

 Interesting post! I didn't know this about April Fools Day myself. You taught me something new. :)

Thank you very much for your helpful corrections!<br/>I'm happy about your comments. :)<br/><br/>&gt; "Of" is used in this case because the forenoon is contained within the day April 1 (if that makes sense?)<br/>Maybe I understood! I feel that using "in" in this case was a little strange, indeed. Thank you.(^^)
