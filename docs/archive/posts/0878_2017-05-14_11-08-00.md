# <strong><em>Haha no Hi</strong></em> (Mother's Day)
<div class="date">May 14, 2017 11:08</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today is Haha no Hi (Mother's Day) to express appreciation to the mother.<br/><br/>In many countries such as the US, Australia, Germany, Brazil, China and Japan, the second Sunday in May is Mother's Day.<br/><br/>However, the origin and the date of Mother's Day are different in many countries.<br/><br/>For example, Mother's Day is: the first Sunday in May in Spain and South Africa, the last Sunday in May in France, Sweden and Morocco, the third Sunday in October in Argentina, and the last Sunday in November in Russia.<br/><br/>In Japan, Mother's Day was March 6, but it didn't spread.<br/><br/>After that, an event to honor the mother was held on May 8, which became a trigger, and finally the second Sunday in May became Mother's Day after the fashion of the US.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I completely forgot the Mother's Day this year.<br/><br/>I ordered flowers just few hours ago, but it may not reach today.

母の日<br/><br/>今日は、母への感謝を表す母の日です。<br/><br/>アメリカやオーストラリア、ドイツ、ブラジル、中国、日本など、多くの国では、5月の第2日曜日が母の日となっています。<br/><br/>しかし、その起源は国によってさまざまで、日付が異なる国も多く存在します。<br/><br/>例えば、スペインや南アフリカ共和国は5月の第1日曜日、フランスやスウェーデン、モロッコは5月の最終日曜日、アルゼンチンは10月の第3日曜日、ロシアは11月の最終日曜日などです。<br/><br/>もともと日本では、3月6日を母の日としていましたが、普及しませんでした。<br/><br/>その後、5月8日に母を讃えるイベントが開催され、これがきっかけとなり、アメリカに倣って5月の第2日曜日が母の日になったとされています。<br/><br/>私は今年の母の日のことをすっかり忘れてしまっていました。<br/><br/>先程オンラインで花を注文しましたが、今日中には届かないかもしれません。
