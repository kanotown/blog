<div class="date">Apr 1, 2019 20:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The Kanji Character with the Largest Number of Strokes<br/><br/>Today I introduced you to the kanji character which has the largest number of strokes among daily-use kanji characters.<br/><br/>It is 鬱 (read as 'utsu'), which needs 29 brushstrokes.<br/><br/>鬱 can mean that plants grow thickly or things are active, but if you use it alone, it will mean "gloomy feeling" or "(clinical) depression."<br/><br/>I think that the action of writing this kanji will make you feel depressed.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the kanji with the second-largest number of strokes is 鑑 (read as 'kan/kagami'), which needs 23 brushstrokes.<br/><br/>鑑 means "example," "model," or "norm."

最も画数の多い漢字<br/><br/>今日は、常用漢字の中で最も画数の多い漢字を紹介します。<br/><br/>それは「鬱」で、29画となります。<br/><br/>「鬱」は、草木が茂っている様子や物事が盛んな様子も表しますが、単体で使った場合は「心が晴れ晴れしないこと」や「うつ病」の意味を表すことが多いです。<br/><br/>「鬱」という字を書くこと自体が、鬱な気分になります。<br/><br/>ちなみに、二番目に画数の多い漢字は「鑑」で、23画となります。<br/><br/>「鑑」は「手本」や「規範」という意味を持ちます。

鬱 can mean that plants grow thickly or things are active, but if you use it alone, it will mean "gloomy feeling" or "(clinical) depression."
<p class="correction_comment">"grow thickly or things are active"<br/><br/>鬱然 ... 欝蒼<br/>It seems that there are very few words where this is used with the first sense.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about the "things are active" meaning. I can't find any words matching that description, unless you are referring to 鬱勃?<br/><br/>"if you use it alone"<br/><br/>Most of the compounds also have a meaning of gloomy/depression.</p>

I think that the action of writing this kanji will make you feel depressed.
<p class="correction_comment">There must be something wrong with me. I like writing this character :)<br/><br/>I find it interesting that the stroke order is 缶、林、冠、凶作…<br/><br/>Normally if something is enclosed by some component, we draw the first part of the enclosing component first, eg:  徼 (彳、白、方、攵）or 門・闇<br/><br/>I suppose that drawing 缶 first makes it easier to get the balance right so that all the parts can fit in the space properly.</p>

Incidentally, the kanji with the second-largest number of strokes is 鑑 (read as 'kan/kagami'), which needs 23 brushstrokes.

鑑 means "example," "model," or "norm." 
<p class="correction_comment">My dictionary gives different meanings. For example:<br/><br/>図鑑<br/>n, Illustrated reference book, illustrated encyclopedia (esp. for children), picture book.<br/><br/>Kanji<br/>図: map, drawing, plan, extraordinary, audacious (JLPT N4) ￼<br/>鑑: specimen, take warning from, learn from (JLPT N1) ￼</p>

“鬱” does mean all of the things listed above. Both of the words listed for the first sense also can be used for the meaning in the second sense. “鬱乎 (ukko)” would be a word which takes the first sense, but I presume it could probably take the second, but it’s not explicitly listed in the copy of the Sanseido Daijirin that I’m using. “鬱勃” does refer to things that are active, but more so in the sense that it is popular. There is another sense that “鬱” can refer to that Toru didn’t mention and that would be to stagnate as in “鬱血 (ukketu)” which refers to vascular congestion (i.e. when a blood vessel becomes congested). I feel this is intrinsically related to the first sence, but it is nice to see it stated somewhere.<br/>Whether or not “鬱” is mostly used in compounds nowadays to refer to being depressed doesn’t change the fact that if it used by itself than it’ll “mean ‘gloomy feeling’ or ‘(clinical) depression.’”<br/><br/>“鑑” can be read as “kagami.” It’s just not in the list of characters for regular use. It is from the same root as “鏡.” It’s just a different glyph for a different sense. The main sense in this case matches what Toru says, but it can also means (badly translated into English) written material that collects materials/data/documents. This describes 図鑑 which is a written material that systematically collects stuff centered around images and diagrams/chart (図). Thus 図鑑 (illustrated reference book) is an illustration-model.<br/><br/>I didn’t mean to ramble that much, but don’t worry because I also enjoy writing the character “鬱,” but a lot of people don’t and prefer to just write “うつ.”

Thank you so much for the corrections and comments!<br/>And thank you for the explanations, ピポ-san! :)<br/><br/>&gt; I'm not sure about the "things are active" meaning. I can't find any words matching that description, unless you are referring to 鬱勃?<br/><br/>As you said, there are few words containing 鬱 that mean "things are active."<br/>鬱勃 might be the only word which matches the above description. As related words, there are 鬱憤 and 鬱血 (mentioned by ピポ-san).
