初夢<br/><br/>新年を迎えてから初めて見る夢を、初夢と言います。<br/><br/>日本では、初夢の内容で1年の吉凶を占う風習があります。<br/><br/>初夢に見ると縁起が良いものを表す諺に「一富士二鷹三茄子」というものがあります。<br/><br/>最も縁起の良いものが富士山、次が鷹、三番目が茄子という意味です。<br/><br/>また、死ぬ夢や震災の夢、排泄物や血の夢も縁起が良いそうです。<br/><br/>自分に励まされる夢や追いかけられる夢は悪い夢だそうです。<br/><br/>私は旧友とロードバイクに乗っている初夢を見ました。

 There are very few mistakes here, and most of the ones I corrected made sense and were just corrected for the sake of clarity. Your English is very good, and I actually had to look up what auspicious meant. Keep it up!

 Interesting :D In Chinese customs, there are something like that too, but we do not really predict our dreams from there. Some of us just treat it as a guide or a normal dream. So is your dream considered good or bad? :)

Thank you very much for correcting my post, and letting my know the interesting thing! :)<br/>In my dream, actually I was climbing a mountain by my bicycle, and it was a race and I was chased by my friends. Mountains are good, but to being chased is bad, so I think my dream was normal, haha.
