# 【No. 0653】<strong><em>Saji o Nageru</strong></em> (Throw a Spoon)
<div class="date">Oct 1, 2016 00:10</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese idiom "saji o nageru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to throw a spoon," and this spoon expresses a spoon that is used in pharmaceutical preparations.<br/><br/>In the past, (Chinese medicine) doctors prepared medicines for curing patients.<br/><br/>However, when any approach to treatment wasn't found, they gave up and threw the spoons for preparing medicines.<br/><br/>From this story, "saji o nageru" came to mean "to conclude there is no chances and give up."<br/><br/>In the Edo period, there was a senryu （satirical haiku/poem） "inaka isha saji o nagete ha uma de nige," which means that a rural doctor threw a spoon and ran away riding a horse.

匙を投げる<br/><br/>今日は日本の慣用句「匙を投げる」を紹介します。<br/><br/>文字通りの意味は "to throw a spoon" であり、匙は薬を調合するためのものを表しています。<br/><br/>かつて医者は、患者を治すために薬の調合も行っていました。<br/><br/>しかし、治療法が見つからないと、諦めて匙を投げ出しました。<br/><br/>このことから、「匙を投げる」は「成功する見込みが無いと判断し、諦める」ことを意味します。<br/><br/>江戸時代の川柳には、「田舎医者 さじを投げては 馬で逃げ」という句もあります。

However, when they <span class="f_blue">could not find any approach to treatment</span>, they gave up and threw the spoons for preparing medicines.
<p class="correction_comment">I think this way emphasizes more that they tried to find an approach but were not able to.</p>

 That's interesting. In English, we have a similar expression to mean to give up. Instead of throw a spoon, we say we "throw in the towel".

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>That's interesting, we also say "タオルを投げる" sometimes. Of course it comes from boxing.
