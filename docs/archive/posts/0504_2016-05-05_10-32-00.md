ペンション<br/><br/>私は一昨日、ペンションに泊まりました。<br/><br/>しかし pension の意味は基本的に「年金」であり、英語話者には意味が伝わりにくいようです。<br/><br/>ペンションは、フランス語の pension からの外来語です。<br/><br/>そして、年金生活者が自宅の空き部屋を学生寮や下宿式のホテルにしたことから、ヨーロッパでは比較的安価な宿泊施設を pension と呼ぶようになりました。<br/><br/>日本でも、宿泊施設のことをペンションと呼びますが、一般的には「西洋風の民宿」を指します。<br/><br/>また、その大半はリゾート地や観光地に建てられており、安価というわけではありません。<br/><br/>イギリスやアメリカにおける B&amp;B に相当するようですが、日本の場合は夕食が付くことも多いです。
