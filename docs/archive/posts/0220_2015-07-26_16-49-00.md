# 【No. 0220】Cycling around the Setting of "Summer Wars"
<div class="date">Jul 26, 2015 16:49</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Since it was fine morning, I rode my bicycle to a foot of a nearby mountain.<br/><br/>Although the cycling was a very short trip, I was able to refresh because I recently had had a lack of exercise .<br/><br/>The following picture is a spot in the neighborhood of my apartment.<br/><br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/ueda.jpg" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/ueda.jpg</a><br/><br/>It might be too rural, but I really like such sceneries surrounded by green.<br/><br/>By the way, this spot is close to the region, which was used as the setting of the Japanese animated movie "Summer Wars."
