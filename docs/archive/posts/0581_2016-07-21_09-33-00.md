# 【No. 0581】The Moon Is Beautiful, Isn't It? (I Love You)
<div class="date">Jul 21, 2016 09:33</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the phrase "tuki ga kirei desune," which sometimes becomes a hot topic.<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "the moon is beautiful, isn't it?," but this phrase might include the meaning of "I love you."<br/><br/>It is said that a Japanese famous novelist and teacher Natsume Soseki said when he heard his student translated "I love you" into "ware kimi o aisu" (ware means I, kimi means you, and aisu means love):<br/><br/>"Japanese people don't use such an expression, you should say 'the moon is beautiful isn't it?'."<br/><br/>That is, he mentioned that Japanese can understand the true meaning, even if you don't use words of love.<br/><br/>This expression is often thought of as affectional, graceful, and beautiful.<br/><br/>However, it might not actually convey the meaning of "I love you," please be careful.

月が綺麗ですね<br/><br/>今日は、日本で時々話題になる「月が綺麗ですね」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>文字通りの意味は「the moon is beautiful」ですが、「I love you」という意味を含むこともあります。<br/><br/>日本の有名な小説家である夏目漱石が英語教師をしていたとき、生徒が「I love you」を「我君ヲ愛ス」と訳したのを聞いて次のように言ったそうです。<br/><br/>「日本人はそんなことを言わない。月が綺麗ですね、とでもしておきなさい。」<br/><br/>つまり、直接的に愛の言葉を使わなくても、日本人には意味が伝わるだろうということです。<br/><br/>この表現は、情緒的で奥ゆかしく美しいとされています。<br/><br/>しかし、意味が伝わらない可能性も十分あるので、注意が必要です。

 what a beautiful expression! I like it a lot. i heard that Japanese people are not so direct with affection compared to Western people. it's an interesting cultural difference, I think.

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>Yes, Japanese people (especially citizens of Kyoto) don't express their feelings directly very much. I also think the cultural difference interesting :)
