<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "kinakusai".<br/><br/>"Kinakusai" means that something or someone is dubious or fishy.<br/><br/>The original meaning of this term is "to smell like that papers or clothes are burnt".<br/><br/>"Kina" in "kinakusai" is said to have been changed from "kinu", which means clothes.<br/>("Kusai" means "to smell".)<br/><br/>Also, since burnt smells are something like a smell of gunpowder, "kinakusai" can mean an atmosphere that war is about to happen.<br/><br/>There meanings came to be expanded, then this term came to have the meaning mentioned at the beginning.<br/><br/>Even now you can express all of the above three meanings by "kinakusai".

きな臭い<br/><br/>今日は「きな臭い」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「きな臭い」は、なんとなく怪しいことや、うさん臭いことを意味します。<br/><br/>この言葉の本来の意味は、「紙や布が焦げた臭いがする」です。<br/><br/>「きな臭い」の「きな」は、「衣」が変化したものだと考えられています。<br/><br/>また、焦げた臭いが火薬の臭いのようでもあることから、戦争が起こりそうな気配がすることも意味します。<br/><br/>これが更に広がり、冒頭のような意味を持つようになりました。<br/><br/>上で述べた三つの意味は、どれも今でも使われています。
