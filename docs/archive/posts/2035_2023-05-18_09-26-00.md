<strong><em>Suzume Hyaku Made Odori Wasurezu</strong></em><br/><br/>It is difficult to break bad habits acquired in childhood, even as one grows older.<br/><br/>The proverb, <strong><em>suzume hyaku made odori wasurezu</em></strong> (雀百まで踊り忘れず), can describe such a situation.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>suzume</em></strong> (雀) means "sparrow," <strong><em>hyaku</em></strong> (百) means "hundred," <strong><em>made</em></strong> (まで) means "until," <strong><em>odori</em></strong> (踊り) means "dance," <strong><em>wasure/wasureru</em></strong> (忘れ/忘れる) means "to forget," and <strong><em>zu</em></strong> (ず) is a negative suffix, the literal meaning of this proverb is "sparrows never forget to dance until they are a hundred years old."<br/><br/>When sparrows move on the ground, they jump in small steps as if dancing.<br/><br/>From the fact that the sparrows' dance-like gait does not change throughout their lifetime, this proverb was born, comparing "dance-like gait" to "bad habit."

雀百まで踊り忘れず<br/><br/>幼い頃に身についてしまった悪い習慣は、歳を重ねてもなかなか直らないものです。<br/><br/>このことを表すことわざに、「雀百まで踊り忘れず」があります。<br/><br/>「雀」は "sparrow"、「百」は "hundred"、「まで」は "until"、「踊り」は "dance"、「忘れ/忘れる」は "to forget"、「ず」は否定語であるため、「雀百まで踊り忘れず」の文字どおりの意味は "sparrows never forget to dance until they are a hundred years old" となります。<br/><br/>雀は地面を移動するとき、踊るように飛び跳ねて歩き回ります。<br/><br/>この雀の踊るような歩き方は生涯変わないことから、「踊り」を「悪習」に喩え、上述のような意味を表すことわざが生まれました。
