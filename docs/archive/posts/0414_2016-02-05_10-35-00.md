# 【No. 0414】Sakha Republic
<div class="date">Feb 5, 2016 10:35</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I searched for Sakha Republic, which is one of 85 federal subjects of the Russian Federation.<br/><br/>Since Sakha Republic has recorded minus 71.2 Celsius degrees, which is the world's lowest temperature except for Antarctica, it is thought of as the cold pole in the Northern Hemisphere.<br/><br/>Also, when the temperature goes below minus 50 degrees, schools seem to be closed.<br/><br/>I think there are little people who are sick, because disease-causing bacteria can't inhabit such cold regions.<br/><br/>However, the temperature seems to goes up to almost 30 degrees in summer.<br/><br/>By the way, Sakha Republic is famous for diamonds, and one fourth of diamonds in the worlds is mined in Sakha.<br/><br/>The number of countries where I want to go increased today.

サハ共和国<br/><br/>今日はロシア連邦を構成する連邦構成主体の一つ、サハ共和国について調べました。<br/><br/>サワ共和国は南極を除くと世界最低気温となるマイナス71.2度を記録しており、北半球の寒極と考えられています。<br/><br/>また、マイナス50度を下回ると、学校は休みになるそうです。<br/><br/>これだけ寒いと病原菌も生息できないので、病気にかかる人は少ないと思います。<br/><br/>ただし、夏になると30度まで気温が上昇するみたいです。<br/><br/>ちなみに名産はダイヤモンドで、世界のダイヤモンドの1/4はサハ共和国産とのことです。<br/><br/>いつか行ってみたい国が一つ増えました。
