枕投げ Part 2<br/><br/>昨日は枕投げという行事について話しました。<br/><br/>今日は、枕投げの公式の競技ルールを紹介します。<br/><br/>競技は畳の上に布団と枕が置かれたフィールドで行われ、選手はユニフォームとして浴衣を着用します。<br/><br/>各チームは8人で構成され、内訳は枕を投げる選手が5人（大将1人、リベロ1人を含む）、エリア外に出た枕を回収するサポートが3人です。<br/><br/>選手は枕をヒットさせられたら退場で、相手チームの大将を退場させれば勝ちです。<br/><br/>リベロは、掛け布団をを持って防御をする役割を持ちます。<br/><br/>また、各チーム1試合につき1回だけ、「先生がきたぞォ～」コールをすることができます。<br/><br/>このコールをしたら、敵の大将は布団に戻り寝たふりをしなければなりません。<br/><br/>大将以外の選手は先生に見つかったという想定で、その場で10秒間正座します。
