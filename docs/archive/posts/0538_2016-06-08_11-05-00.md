マックシェイクと母乳<br/><br/>私の大学にはマクドナルドがあるため、私はたまにマックシェイクを飲みます。<br/><br/>このマックシェイクは飲みにくいことで有名ですが、それには理由があります。<br/><br/>マクドナルドは研究で、人間は何かを飲むとき、もっとも美味しいと感じるスピードは母乳を飲むスピードであると結論付けました。<br/><br/>マックシェイクのストローの太さは、この母乳のスピードを実現するよう調整されています。<br/><br/>マックシェイクを飲むとき、私たちは無意識のうちに赤ん坊の頃を思い出しているそうです。<br/><br/>そして本能的にマックシェイクを欲するようになるそうです。<br/><br/>ある種のドラッグかもしれません。
