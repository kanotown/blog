# Forest Bath
<div class="date">Nov 27, 2015 10:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The forest bath allows you to relax and to feel clear and fresh scents.<br/><br/>The reason is because that you breathe a harmful substance called 'phytoncide.'<br/><br/>Forests release this substance so as to survive, and kill surrounding plants, harmful microorganisms, and insects.<br/><br/>As the result, there are almost no unpleasant odors from such as animal corpses or excrement in forests.<br/><br/>Also, although phytoncide is harmful for plants or insects, there are no bad influences for human beings, and it brings benefits especially to people who go forests frequently like us.<br/><br/>However, people who have never gone to forests, such as Arctic indigenous people, could get a headache.

森林浴<br/><br/>森林浴はとて気持ちが良く、澄んだ爽やかな香りを感じます。<br/><br/>これは、フィトンチッドと呼ばれる有害物質を吸っているためです。<br/><br/>森林は自身が生き残り、周囲の植物や有害な微生物、昆虫を殺すために、この物質を出しています。<br/><br/>その結果、森林では動物の死骸や排泄物などの嫌な臭いがほとんどしません。<br/><br/>また、フィトンチッドは有害物質と書きましたが、人間、特に我々のようによく森に行く人間には全くの無害であり、むしろ健康に良いそうです。<br/><br/>しかし、森に一切行ったことがない北極圏の先住民などは頭が痛くなることがあるそうです。

Sorry, I missed a sentence. I corrected that sentence below "Forests release this substance to survive, because it kills surrounding plants, harmful microorganisms, and insects"
