<div class="date">Jun 8, 2021 11:15</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Ushiroyubi wo Sasareru</strong></em><br/><br/>When someone says something bad about you without you knowing it, your situation is described as <strong><em>ushiroyubi wo sasareru</em></strong> (後ろ指を指される) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>ushiro</em></strong> (後ろ) means "back/behind," <strong><em>yubi</em></strong> (指) means "finger," and <strong><em>sasareru</em></strong> (指される) means "being pointed at (by someone)," the literal meaning of <em>yubi wo sasareru</em> is "being pointed at from behind by someone."<br/><br/>The act of pointing at someone is considered rude in many countries around the world.<br/><br/>This phrase implies that pointing at someone from behind without his/her knowledge is equals to saying badly about him/her.

後ろ指を指される<br/><br/>本人の知らないところで悪口を言われることを、「後ろ指を指される」と言います。<br/><br/>「後ろ」は "back/behind"、「指」は "finger"、「指される」は "being pointed at (by someone)" を意味するので、「後ろ指を指される」の文字どおりの意味は "being pointed at from behind by someone" です。<br/><br/>人に対して指をさす行為は、世界の多くの国で失礼とされています。<br/><br/>本人に気づかれないように後ろから指をさすということは、その人を悪く言っているということです。

 My favourite thing is the sniggering that often accompanies the finger pointing.

Thank you for the correction! :)<br/>I feel that sniggering is often seen in comedy films/dramas.

 I hate people gossiping. Would rather have a face down if either person has a problem but then it could be filmed for drama-hungry netizen (inter[net] ci[tizen]), and knowing how improper people have been acting online and in real world, it's always best to ignore the bad mouthing... unless the gossips get out of hand.

Thank you for the correction!<br/>Gossip often leads to bad results, so as you said, I also think it's wise to ignore/avoid it. :)
