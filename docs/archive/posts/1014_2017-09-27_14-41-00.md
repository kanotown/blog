# <strong><em>Ao Tenjō</strong></em> (青天井 - Dome of the Sky)
<div class="date">Sep 27, 2017 14:41</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Have you ever thought that the sky was a blue ceiling?<br/><br/>In Japan, there is the term "ao tenjō" (青天井), the literal meaning of which is "a blue ceiling," and it implies the sky.<br/><br/>Also, "ao tenjō" is often used in business scenes.<br/><br/>The blue sky has an almost endless height, unlike ordinary ceilings.<br/><br/>Because of this, "ao tenjō" also means that there is no payment amount limits in transactions, or a market price of goods continues to rise for a long time.<br/><br/>Incidentally, if you say "ao tenjō" in the mah-jong field, it means a horrible rule that doesn't have a score limit.

青天井<br/><br/>空を見上げたとき、青色の天井だと思ったことはありますか？<br/><br/>日本では、青空を青い天井に見立てて、「青天井」と言うことがあります。<br/><br/>また、「青天井」はビジネスシーンで使われることがあります。<br/><br/>青空は通常の天井とは異なり、果てしない高さがあります。<br/><br/>このことから、取引などにおいて金額の上限が無いことや、物の相場が長期間上がり続けることを、「青天井」と言います。<br/><br/>ちなみに、麻雀の世界で「青天井」と言うと、最高得点を設けない恐ろしいルールのことを指します。
