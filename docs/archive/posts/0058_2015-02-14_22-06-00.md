<h1 id="subject_show">Puke Words</h1>
<div class="date">Feb 14, 2015 22:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I searched an English phrase which means "ゲロを吐く (puke or vomit)," as a result, some phrases like as follows were founded:<br/><br/>"bark at ants"<br/>"feed the fish"<br/>"sing to the sink"<br/>"woof one's cookies"<br/><br/>I didn't know why these phrases mean "puke," so I thought the reason.<br/><br/>"bark at ants"<br/>Since ants are worming on the ground, the puking pose looks like barking at ants. Maybe that's why.<br/><br/>"feed the fish"<br/>I thought this phrase liken vomited foods to fish food.<br/><br/>"sing to the sink"<br/>A scene that a human is puking to the sink is as if who are singing to the sink. Maybe.<br/><br/>"woof one's cookies"<br/>The word woof is similar to the word puke, but I didn't know why cookies. This phrase might liken vomited foods to cookies.<br/><br/> I'm so sorry for posting a dirty content.<br/><br/>Also, according to the following webpage, there were so many puke words. I gave up to think where all of these words come from.<br/><a href="http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/puke-words/" target="_blank">http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/puke-words/</a>

 Your English vocabulary is great, now you just need to keep your verb tenses consistent. I know that's much easier said than done.

 I really enjoyed this post. Colloquialisms from other languages are really fascinating.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If you're curious which of these are actually common, I've heard "barf", "puke, "vomit", "throw up", "spit up" (usually for babies), "hurl", "toss one's cookies", and  "worship the porcelain god" (because toilets are made of porcelain and you kneel in front of one). "Heave" and "retch" refer more to when there's nothing left in your stomach but you're still bent over the toilet.
 <br/>
 But as with any slang phrase, it's very regional. For reference, I'm from the western United States.

Thank you so much for correcting me! I will keep trying my best to study English! :D<br/><br/>Actually I like to learn slang phrases, so your comments are really helpful to me. (๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵)<br/>
