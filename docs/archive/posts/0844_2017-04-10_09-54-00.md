Today I will talk about the Japanese adjective "shira jira shii."<br/><br/>Both of the "shira" and the "jira" means "white," so this adjective can literally mean that something looks white.<br/><br/>However, in most cases, it means that someone's lie is blatant or someone pretend to know nothing about what he/her knows.<br/><br/>Usage example: Don't say the bland flattery (shirajira shii oseji).<br/><br/>Originally, "shiro" (white) is often used to imply that something is clear.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is thought that "shirajira shii" was derived from the meaning that your true feelings are clear.<br/><br/>Incidentally, according to my dictionary, "to tell a 'shirajira shii' lie" is translated into "to lie through one's teeth."

白々しい<br/><br/>今日は「白々しい」という日本語の形容詞を紹介します。<br/><br/>「白々しい」は、文字通り何かが白く見えるようすを表すこともありますが、大抵の場合、「嘘が見え透いているようす」や「知っているのに知らないふりをするようす」を意味します。<br/><br/>使用例：「白々しいお世辞はやめろ。」<br/><br/>「白」は、何かがはっきりしているという意味でよく使われます。<br/><br/>「白々しい」は、「本心がはっきりしている」ということから派生したものと考えられます。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「白々しい嘘をつく」を英語では "lie through one's teeth" と言うようです。
