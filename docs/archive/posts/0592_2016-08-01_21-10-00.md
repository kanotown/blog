# 【No. 0592】Botamochi
<div class="date">Aug 1, 2016 21:10</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about a traditional Japanese cake called botamochi.<br/><br/>Botamochi is a rice cake wrapped in sweet bean paste.<br/><br/>This rice cake is made by boiling/steaming sticky rice and non-glutinous rice, pounding them lightly, and making it into a ball.<br/><br/>Also, there is a Japanese cake called "ohagi," which is almost the same as botamochi.<br/><br/>There are several theories that explain the difference between botamochi and ohagi, but I think that the theory, which insists that the name depend on the season, is widely accepted.<br/><br/>Since botan (tree peonies) bloom in the spring, botamochi is a spring mochi (rice cakes).<br/><br/>Since hagi (bush clovers) bloom in autumn, ohagi is an autumn mochi.<br/><br/>By the way, there is a famous saying "tana kara botamochi" (botamochi falls from a shelf into one's mouth), which expresses an unexpected lucky.<br/><br/>This saying is often referred to as "tanabota" for short.

ぼたもち<br/><br/>今日は、和菓子「ぼたもち」を紹介します。<br/><br/>ぼたもちは、もち米とうるち米を混ぜたものを炊くか蒸すかし、軽くついて丸めて餡をまぶした食べ物です。<br/><br/>ほとんど同じ和菓子に、「おはぎ」があります。<br/><br/>ぼたもちとおはぎの違いについては諸説ありますが、季節によって呼び分けるという説が有力です。<br/><br/>ぼたもちは牡丹の花が咲く季節、すなわち春のもちであり、おはぎは萩の花が咲く季節、すなわち秋のもちです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、有名なことわざに予期しない幸運を表す「棚からぼたもち」があります。<br/><br/>この言葉はしばしば「たなぼた」と省略して使われます。
