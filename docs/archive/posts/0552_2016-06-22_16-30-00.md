# 【No. 0552】Daijobu
<div class="date">Jun 22, 2016 16:30</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "daijobu."<br/><br/>"Daijobu" means something like "it's okay" or "no problem," and is often used in daily life.<br/><br/>For example: "Ashita yasundemo iidesuka?" "Daijobu desu."<br/>("Can I take a day off tomorrow?" "No problem.")<br/><br/>However, you have to be careful because "daijobu" has also meanings like "it's enough" and "no thank you."<br/><br/>For example: "Gohan tabeni ikanai?" "Daijobu desu."<br/>("How about going out for lunch?" "No thank you.")<br/><br/>Originally, "daijobu" meant only affirmative, but it has come to be used also in negative meanings, because direct denials might bruise someone.<br/><br/>Since the usage of "daijobu" is really confusing even for us, I recommend for you to add supplemental words after saying "daijobu."

大丈夫<br/><br/>今日は「大丈夫」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「大丈夫」は "it's okay" や "no problem" のような意味であり、とてもよく使われます。<br/><br/>例：「明日休んでもいいですか？」「大丈夫です。」<br/><br/>しかし、"it's enough" や "no thank you" のような意味も持つため、注意が必要です。<br/><br/>例：「ご飯食べに行きませんか？」「大丈夫です。」<br/><br/>本来、「大丈夫」は肯定の意味しかありませんが、直接的に否定すると相手を傷つけるかもしれないという考えから、否定の意味でも使用されるようになりました。<br/><br/>日本人にとってもとても紛らわしいので、「大丈夫です」と言った後には一言補足をすることをおすすめします。

 Thank you for your detailed explanation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It reminded me of how one has to be careful with saying いい as well, since it can also mean indirect refusal.

Thank you for the comment :)<br/>Indeed, 「いい」 is also difficult to use. It can show two opposite meanings.

 It makes a lot of sense to me, actually, since English can be similar in some ways. ^^
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Say you're at a restaurant, and the waiter asks if you'd like more of your chosen drink. "I'm good," can actually be a response - though a "thanks" is usually customary too.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And really, in general, you can turn down things by saying "it's alright" or "I'm good." ^^

Thank you for your comment :)<br/>I learned that phrases that can be interpreted two opposite ways are also exist in English!<br/>Thank you for letting me know the case :)<br/>
