<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Demakase</strong></em> (でまかせ - Tall Tale)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Jun 21, 2019 10:35</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Demakase</strong></em><br/><br/>I sometimes see a person who say <strong><em>demakase</em></strong> (でまかせ).<br/><br/><em>Demakase</em> means to say something at random, to tell a tall tale, and such words themselves.<br/><br/>Here, <strong><em>de</em></strong> (で) means "(to bring) out," and <strong><em>makase</em></strong> (まかせ) means "to rely on someone" or "to let it go."<br/><br/>Because of this, <em>demakse</em> implies words brought out on their own from one's mouth, and such words will be emotionless and nonsense.<br/><br/>Incidentally, another Japanese word <strong><em>dema</em></strong> (でま) has the same meaning as <em>demakase</em>, but these etymologies are completely different.

でまかせ<br/><br/>私はときどき「でまかせ」を言う人を見かけます。<br/><br/>「でまかせ」とは、いい加減なことを言うことや、そのような言葉を意味します。<br/><br/>「で」は "out"、「まかせ」は "to rely on someone" や "to let it go" を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち、「でまかせ」は「出るに任せて発した言葉」ということであり、そのような言葉は感情がこもっていなかったりでたらめだったりするというわけです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「でまかせ」と同様の意味を持つ言葉に「でま」がありますが、語源は全く異なります。

 「でっち上げる」という言葉も類似な語幹であるのでしょうか。（出ちゃってあげるのような言い方で）

興味深いコメントをありがとうございます。:)<br/>調べたところ、「でっち上げる」の「でっち」は "fabricated" を意味する「捏（でつ）」から来ているようです。

Thank you for the correction and comments! (^^)

You're welcome :)

I'm sorry, but please let me write a supplementary explanation.<br/>Previously, I learned that foreign languages (such as Japanese) should be written in italics, but we cannot use italics on Lang-8, so in my posts, I've used single quotes instead of italics for Japanese terms. When my posts on Lang-8 move to my blog, I remove the single quotes and use italics.
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Yalmar</span><br>
Oh, that sounds very efficient - you can then replace all the single quotes with italics :) You have a very nice blog! It would be nice if you also had some audio files to hear the correct pronunciation and intonation of your examples – perhaps one at normal speed and one at slow speed – but perhaps it's too much work :)
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
Thank you for the comment. :)<br/>And thank you for your proposal! Indeed such audio files would be effective, but it might exceed my capacity limitation, haha.
