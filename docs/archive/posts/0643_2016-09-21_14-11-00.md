犬と亀<br/><br/>"Dog" は日本語で「犬」です。<br/><br/>しかし明治時代、犬（特に洋犬）は「カメ」と呼ばれていました。<br/><br/>また、当時「カメ」は犬の名前としても人気がありました。<br/><br/>これは、英語の聞き間違いから来ているとされています。<br/><br/>西洋人が "come here" とを呼び寄せているのを見て、日本人は「カメや」と名前を呼んでいると勘違いしたそうです。<br/><br/>（日本では人や動物を呼ぶとき、名前の後ろに「や」付けることがあります。）<br/><br/>これが広まり、「犬」は「カメ」と呼ばれていました。<br/><br/>現在では「カメ」と言っても決して「犬」を意味しないので注意して下さい。

 'Kame ya' sounds like an Australian accent. I wonder if the Westerners who said it first were from Australian, haha

Such misunderstanding spread, and that is why dogs were called "kame" by Japanese people.
<p class="correction_comment">The original sentence has no major grammatical problem actually. This is just a suggestion to make it sound more natural :)</p>
