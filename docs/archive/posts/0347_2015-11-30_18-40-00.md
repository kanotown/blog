11月29日<br/><br/>昨日は11月29日でした。<br/><br/>良い（11）肉（29）の日です。<br/><br/>忘れていました。<br/><br/>この日、日本の肉屋や焼肉店は様々なキャンペーンを行なっていたようです。<br/><br/>また、11月29日は良い（11）服（29）の日でもあります。<br/><br/>きっと色々な服屋さんでキャンペーンが行われていたと思います。<br/><br/>私は研究室に引きこもっていたのでわかりません。<br/><br/>ちなみに、11月29日は年始から333日目です。

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>&gt; What do you mean?<br/>Sorry for my confusing English. We can read 1129 as いいにく(good meat), so we define November 29th as the good meat day. Also, the is a kind of meat promotion day.<br/><br/>&gt; Are these days well known to Japan?<br/>Actually, these days are less well-known, haha.

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/>&gt; what is "ii"?<br/>I'm sorry, I think that further explanations were needed in this sentence.<br/>We can read 11 as i-i (いい), because 1 is read as 'ichi' in Japan and we often read initials of numbers. And, 'いい(良い)' means 'good.'
