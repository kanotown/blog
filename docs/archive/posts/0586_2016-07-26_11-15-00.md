海苔<br/><br/>私は海苔が大好きで、よく食べます。<br/><br/>海苔は、おにぎりや巻き寿司などに使われるだけでなく、佃煮としてもよく食されています。<br/><br/>とても健康に良い食材としても知られており、タンパク質、ビタミン、ミネラル、食物繊維などが豊富に含まれています。<br/><br/>海外の人にとって、日本の板海苔はカーボン紙のように感じると聞きました。<br/><br/>これが理由で、カリフォルニアロールは海苔が米の内側に海苔があるそうです。<br/>（日本の巻き寿司は、海苔は通常外側に使われます。）<br/><br/>また、フランスのロスコス生物学研究所の研究によると、日本人のみが海苔などの海藻を効率的に分解できるバクテリアを体内に保有しているそうです。

 That study is incredibly interesting! I had no idea that the Japanese are the only ones with bacteria to fully digest seaweed. Never before have I wanted to get bacteria so bad. Haha!

Thank you for the comment!<br/>Tons of bacteria (around 50 trillion) are included in our bodies, and they always help us :)
