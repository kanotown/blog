七夕<br/><br/>今日は、七夕でした。<br/><br/>七夕は、中国や日本、ベトナムなどにおける節供の一つです。<br/><br/>我々はよく、短冊に願い事を書いて、笹に飾ります。<br/><br/>もともと中国では、芸事が上達するようにお祈りをする風習がありました。<br/><br/>それが江戸時代に日本に伝わり、習字が上達するようにと願って短冊に書いたのが始まりとされています。<br/><br/>そしていつの間にか、「短冊に願い事を書くと叶う」というように変化したそうです。

 I made some of the corrections based on the Japanese version of your write-up :) I like the story behind this festival and probably one of the Japanese festivals that I'll never forget because my ojichan was born on the same date and I remember him telling me about it so ^^
