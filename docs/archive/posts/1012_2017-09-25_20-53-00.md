ゴールド免許<br/><br/>私は今日、運転免許証を更新して、ゴールド免許を手に入れました。<br/><br/>日本の運転免許証は、グリーン、ブルー、ゴールドの3種類に分けられ、数年おきに更新する必要があります。<br/><br/>グリーン免許は初めて免許を取得した人のみが持つ免許で、有効期限は2～3年です。<br/><br/>ブルー免許はグリーン免許から更新でなった人か、過去5年間に違反が1回以上ある人が持つ免許で、有効期限は3～5年です。<br/><br/>そしてゴールド免許は、更新前の過去5年間に事故・違反が一切ない人が持つ免許で、有効期限は5年です。<br/><br/>ゴールド免許は正式には、「優良運転者免許証」と呼ばれます。<br/><br/>ゴールド免許を取得する最も簡単で確実な方法は、免許取得後に運転をしないことです。
