# 【No. 0433】A Dog Person and A Cat Person
<div class="date">Feb 24, 2016 19:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Dogs and cats are very popular as pets.<br/><br/>I heard the number of dogs and cats kept as pets are almost the same.<br/><br/>However, according to a questionnaire survey, the ratio of dog persons is around 60%, while cat persons is around 40%.<br/><br/>Also, there seems to be some good trend in dog persons.<br/><br/>For example, the questionnaire result showed that dog persons have more friends on SNSs, and are more liked by various people.<br/><br/>Especially for men, an average annual income of dog persons was about 10,000 dollars higher than cat persons.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the number of cat videos is overwhelmingly larger than dog videos.<br/><br/>I like both dogs and cats.

犬派と猫派<br/><br/>犬や猫は、ペットとして人気があります。<br/><br/>そして現在飼育されている犬と猫の数は、ほぼ同じだそうです。<br/><br/>しかしアンケート調査によると、犬が好きな人が6割、猫が好きな人が4割だったそうです。<br/><br/>また、犬派のほうが様々な点で優位な傾向が見られたそうです。<br/><br/>例えば、犬派のほうが告白された回数が多く、SNSの友達も多かったそうです。<br/><br/>特に男性に関しては、犬派の年収が猫派の年収よりも約100万円高かったそうです。<br/><br/>一方、インターネット上の動画数は猫のほうが圧倒的に多いようです。<br/><br/>私は犬も猫もどちらも大好きです。

 I've always been an animal lover, and I've had both dogs and cats, but I probably identify more as a cat person than a dog person... D:
