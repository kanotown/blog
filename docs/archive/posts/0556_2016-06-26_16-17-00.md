# The Japanese Phrase "Dakara"
<div class="date">Jun 26, 2016 16:17</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese conjunction "dakara."<br/><br/>"Dakara" has the meaning of "hence" or "so," but you have to be careful to use this at the beginning of a sentence.<br/><br/>Basically, since "dakara" is used to even or lower ranking people, it's possible to make someone feel bad.<br/><br/>Recently, many Japanese people use "nanode" instead of "dakara," as an alternative expression.<br/><br/>Although "nanode" is a softer expression, it's not a independent conjunction, so you can't use it strictly at the beginning of a sentence.<br/><br/>If you want to use correct Japanese, you can use "shitagatte," "ijo no kotokara," "sonotame," or "desunode," though these are stiff and formal.

「だから」という日本語<br/><br/>今日は、日本語の接続詞「だから」について話します。<br/><br/>「だから」は "hence" や "so" という意味を持ちますが、文頭で使う際は注意が必要です。<br/><br/>基本的に、「だから」は対等関係か目下の人に使われることが多く、相手を不快にさせる可能性があります。<br/><br/>その代わりの表現として、近年では「なので」を使う日本人が増えています。<br/><br/>「なので」は柔らかい表現ですが、独立した接続詞ではないので、文頭で使うのは誤りです。<br/><br/>少し固い表現ではありますが、正しい日本語を使いたい場合は、「従って」「以上のことから」「そのため」「ですので」などを使うと良いと思います。
