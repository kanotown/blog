# 【No. 0702】Yubi wo Kuwaeru
<div class="date">Nov 19, 2016 14:46</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the phrase "yubi wo kuwaeru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of this phrase is "to put one's finger in one's mouth," and it expresses a state that someone envies other people/things but can't get them.<br/><br/>Actually I searched for the etymology, but it was not exist on the Internet.<br/><br/>Note that the following sentences are just my thought.<br/><br/>It is said that one of the reasons why babies and young children put their fingers in their mouths is to disguise their hunger.<br/><br/>It looks like they envy dishes but can't get them, so eat their fingers instead.<br/><br/>From such a scene, I think that this phrase has come to express the above meaning.

指をくわえる<br/><br/>今日は「指をくわえる」という表現を紹介します。<br/><br/>「指をくわえる」は、他人のことやものが羨ましいけれど手が出せないでいる状態を表します。<br/><br/>語源を調べてみましたが、インターネット上にはありませんでした。<br/><br/>以下の語源に関する文章は私の予想であるので、注意して下さい。<br/><br/>小さい子供が指をしゃぶる理由の一つに、空腹を紛らわせるというものがあります。<br/><br/>ご飯を食べたいけれど手が届かないので指をくわえて我慢する様子から、現在の意味になったのだと思います。
