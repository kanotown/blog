# 【No. 1498】<strong><em>Hana no Shita wo Nobasu</strong></em> (鼻の下を伸ばす - Spoony)
<div class="date">Jan 24, 2019 21:01</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Hana no Shita wo Nobasu</strong></em><br/><br/>When you womanize or have a loose face due to an attractive woman, it can be described as an idiom, <strong><em>hana no shita wo nobasu</em></strong> (鼻の下を伸ばす).<br/><br/><strong><em>Hana</em></strong> (鼻) means "nose," <strong><em>shita</em></strong> (下) means "under," and <strong><em>nobasu</em></strong> (伸ばす) means "to stretch/extend," so the literal meaning of this idiom is "to stretch/extend the area under one's nose."<br/><br/>In fact, when a man is attracted by a woman, his face would be loosened, and the area under his nose would seem to be stretched.<br/><br/>Because of this, <em>hana no shita wo nobasu</em> came to have its current meaning.

鼻の下を伸ばす<br/><br/>女性にだらしないさまや、好みの女性を前にして顔が緩むことを、「鼻の下を伸ばす」と言います。<br/><br/>「鼻」は "nose," 「下」は "under"、「伸ばす」は "to stretch/extend" を意味するので、この慣用句の文字どおりの意味は "to stretch/extend the area under one's nose" です。<br/><br/>実際、女性の色気に心を奪われている人は、顔が緩み、鼻の下が伸びたように見えます。<br/><br/>このことから、「鼻の下を伸ばす」は上記のような意味を持つようになったというわけです。

 This reminds me of all those cartoons where a male character sees an attractive woman and their eyes pop out of their heads, their jaws drop to the ground, and their tongues roll out of their mouths.  :)

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/>I can image these cartoons easily, haha. However, I think that they are also surprised simultaneously. On the other hand, this idiom is used when you are embarrassed. I found a tweet related to this idiom.<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/dizzy_ziddy/status/993047830942990337" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/dizzy_ziddy/status/993047830942990337</a>

Thanks for sharing.<br/>Yes, you're right. Their expressions in those cartoons were exaggerated compared to a face you would describe as  鼻の下を伸ばす.
