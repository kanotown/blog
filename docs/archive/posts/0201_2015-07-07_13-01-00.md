Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; I'm not sure what "half degree" means.<br/>Sorry for the confusion.<br/>I wanted to say something like "the level of fermentation is around 50%."<br/>I hope this makes sense.<br/><br/>&gt; What does "bister" mean?<br/>I wanted to express tea-like brown, and my dictionary said something like "bister means burnt umber(medium brown) or dark brown color," so I used this word.<br/>
