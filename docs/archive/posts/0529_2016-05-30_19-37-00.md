# 【No. 0529】Barrel
<div class="date">May 30, 2016 19:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the unit "barrel," which is used for representing a volume.<br/><br/>The "barrel" is often used to represent the amount of oil, but there are various definitions depending on applications or countries.<br/><br/>For the amount of oil, one barrel is defined as 42 US gallons (about 160 liters).<br/><br/>In the US, one fluid barrel is 31.5 US fluid gallons (about 119 liters), and one beer barrel is 31 fluid gallons (about 117 liters).<br/><br/>Also, a dry barrel that is used for grains and vegetables 105 dry quarts (about 116 liters).<br/><br/>In the UK, one beer barrel is 36 UK gallons (about 164 litres).<br/><br/>Since these units, barrel and gallon are rarely used in Japan, it's very confusing for me.

バレル<br/><br/>今日は、「バレル（bbl）」という体積を表す単位について書きます。<br/><br/>石油の量を表す際によく用いられるバレルですが、用途や国によってさまざまな定義があります。<br/><br/>石油については、1バレルは42米液量ガロン（約160リットル）とされています。<br/><br/>また、アメリカにおいて、一般的な液体に対する1液量バレルは31.5米液量ガロン（約119リットル）で、ビールに対する1液量バレルは31米液量ガロン（約117リットル）です。<br/><br/>穀物や野菜に用いられる標準乾量バレルは、105乾量クォート（約116リットル）です。<br/><br/>イギリスにおいては、ビールに対する1バレルは、36英ガロン（約164リットル）です。<br/><br/>バレルもガロンも日本ではほとんど使われない単位なので、ややこしいです。

<p class="correction_comment">When you have a submissive clause like "that is used for grains and vegetables" you can skip the subject (in this case "that is"). If all goes well the meaning is clear from the logic of the sentence.<br/><br/>Actually I'm not sure it's really called a submissive clause. One way or another my point is the same.</p>

 I suppose you know that but "litres" is the UK spelling and "liters" is the US spelling (to simplify). You aren't consequent in your text about this spelling, but that's kind of all right seeing as it is a text about confusion between units in different places. :)

Thank you very much for the corrections and your helpful explanations!<br/><br/>Yes, I intentionally used "litres" when I talked about the UK. However, I think that I should have mentioned about the spellings, or unified them. Thank you :)
