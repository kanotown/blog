 There is a pretty similar idiom in English which is very common. It's called a "double-edged sword" (e.g., "The situation is a double-edged sword.")
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It's called that because it's like a sword where both edges are sharp, so if you try to cut someone with it, you will also cut yourself.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There's even another one, which I think is more of an American idiom, but I'm not sure: "You're damned if you do, damned if you don't." This is a bit more vulgar obviously, so you wouldn't be able to use it in some situations, but it's also very common (in America at least).

Thank you so much for the correcting my post!<br/>Actually, there is an idiom "moroha no tsurugi," that corresponds to "double-edged sword."<br/>I wrote about that in the following post:<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/159081980167889056295251896924256504780" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/159081980167889056295251896924256504780</a><br/><br/>Also, I didn't know the idiom, "You're damned if you do, damned if you don't." I think that it's indeed similar.<br/>Thank you for letting me know that :)

 Interesting! I guess choosing the lesser evil will have to suffice.
