<h1 id="subject_show">Vacuum Cleaner</h1>
<div class="date">Jan 28, 2015 23:40</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A few days ago, I cleaned up my room in ages.<br/><br/>The messy room became tidy, however, my vacuum cleaner was on its last legs.<br/><br/>I couldn't finish the cleanup at that time, so I've left with such a halfway feeling.<br/><br/>And tonight, the new vacuum cleaner that I ordered on Amazon was delivered.<br/><br/>I can't wait to use it until Tomorrow morning, but I have to control myself because it might be noisy. <br/><br/>Whenever I open a new product, even if it was a cleaning supply, I'm so excited always.<br/>

Thank you so much for correcting me! (^-^)<br/><br/>&gt; "for the first time in ages" is a fixed expression<br/><br/>Oh, I didn't know that, and the phrase was not written in my dictionary. My dictionary sometimes useless.
