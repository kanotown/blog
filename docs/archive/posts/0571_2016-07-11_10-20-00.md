# 【No. 0571】Itaino Itaino Tondeike! (Pain, Pain, Go Away!)
<div class="date">Jul 11, 2016 10:20</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Japan, when children fall down or get injured, their parents often say "itaino itaino tondeike~," (pain, pain, go away~) while rubbing the affected area.<br/><br/>This act is often thought as a kind of charm, but it seems to have actual effects.<br/><br/>According to a study at Gunma University, the act of rubbing could promote the restoration/regeneration of your peripheral nerves.<br/><br/>In addition, since children can feel their parents' love, their fears of injury disappear, and the pain seems to be allowed relief indirectly.<br/><br/>Also, it is said that placebo effects by what the words mean could affect the pain.

痛いの痛いの飛んでいけ<br/><br/>日本では、子どもが転んだり怪我をしたとき、よく親が患部をさすりながら「痛いの痛いの飛んでいけ」と言います。<br/><br/>この行為はおまじないと考えられることが多いですが、本当に効果があるようです。<br/><br/>群馬大学の研究によると、さするという行為が末梢神経の回復・再生を促進させる可能性があるそうです。<br/><br/>更に、子どもは母親からの愛情を感じ、怪我の不安から逃れ、痛みを間接的に和らげることができるとのことです。<br/><br/>それ以外にも、その言葉が持つプラセボ効果の影響もあると言われています。

 Excellent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Better used of effect/affect than many native speakers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Also, very cute expression.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 We rub and blow on the injury.

Thank you very much for correcting my post!<br/>I'm glad to hear you say that (^^)<br/>Yeah, we also blow the injury. And if I follow my instincts, I think I will tongue the injure :)

injury, not injure. (to) Injure is a verb. You injure something and an injury is the result.<br/><br/>And maybe lick, not tongue.<br/>Or maybe I'm missing something... (sounds a bit 嫌らしい)
