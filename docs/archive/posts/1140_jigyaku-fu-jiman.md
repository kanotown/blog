<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There is a Japanese slang term: 自虐風自慢 (jigyaku-fū jiman), which was born from the Internet.<br/><br/>自虐 (jigyaku) means "self-condemnation," 風 (fū) means "sounds like," and 自慢 (jiman) means "brag."<br/><br/>Therefore, "jigyaku-fū jiman" means one's brag that sounds like self-condemnation.<br/><br/>For example, it's something like the following utterances.<br/><br/>"Oh, I received ONLY $10,000 as a bonus in summer, it's terrible."<br/><br/>"These days various men try to ask me out almost every day, sigh.., I'm tired of refusing them."<br/><br/>Since "jigyaku-fū jiman" makes people uncomfortable, please be careful not to say it.
