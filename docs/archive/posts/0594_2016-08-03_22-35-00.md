タバスコ<br/><br/>タバスコは、メキシコ原産の唐辛子、チレ・タバスコを使った辛味調味料です。<br/><br/>世界的にホットソースの代名詞となっており、多くの家庭でさまざまな料理に利用されています。<br/><br/>タバスコは、すり潰したタバスコペッパーをオーク樽で3年間熟成させて作られます。<br/><br/>この製方は、製造が始まった1868年以来変わっていません。<br/><br/>発明者のエドムンド・マキレニーは、もともと彼の好物である生牡蠣用のソースとしてタバスコを考えました。<br/><br/>日本では、パスタやピザなどのイタリア料理に対してよく使われます。<br/><br/>しかし、イタリアではピザやパスタにタバスコはかけないそうです。
