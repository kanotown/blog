A happy new year.<br/><br/>Today, January 1st, a leap second was inserted for the first time in one year and six months.<br/><br/>A leap second is a second that is added or deleted to eliminate the difference between the time system based on atomic clocks and the time system based on Earth's rotation.<br/><br/>In Japan, 8:59:60 am was inserted between 8:59:59 and 9:00:00.<br/><br/>The insertion of leap seconds was conducted 27 times so far.<br/><br/>I heard engineers would become very busy due to the insertion of the leap second, but I don't know how busy they are.<br/><br/>By the way, Google adjusted the time by delaying clock frequencies slightly, without inserting a leap second.

うるう秒の挿入<br/><br/>あけましておめでとうございます。<br/><br/>本日、2017年1月1日は、1年6ヶ月ぶりにうるう秒が挿入されました。<br/><br/>うるう秒とは、原子時計による時刻系と、地球の自転のよる時刻系の時差を無くすために、挿入または削除される1秒のことです。<br/><br/>日本では、午前8時59分59秒と午前9時00分00秒の間に、午前8時59分60秒が追加されました。<br/><br/>うるう秒の挿入は、これで27回目となります。<br/><br/>うるう秒によって、エンジニアは大変な思いをすると聞きましたが、どれくらい大変なのか私にはよくわかりません。<br/><br/>ちなみにGoogleは、12月31日から1月1日にかけて、わずかにクロックの進みを遅くすることで、うるう秒の挿入無しに時間を調整したそうです。

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/><br/>&gt; Today, January 1st, a leap second was inserted for the first time in one year and six months.<br/>&gt; What do you want to say? It's very unclear.<br/>I wanted to say something like:<br/>A leap second was inserted on January 1st.<br/>Insertion of a leap second was the first time in 18 months.<br/>(That is, the previous insertion was performed 18 months ago.)

It's very unclear.<br/>I wanted to say something like:<br/>"Since this system of correction was implemented in 1972, 27 leap seconds have been inserted."<br/>(Quoted from Wikipedia)
