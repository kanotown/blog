# 【No. 1934】<strong><em>Soramimi</em></strong> (空耳 - Hearing Things)
<div class="date">Aug 12, 2021 20:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Soramimi</em></strong><br/><br/>These days, I hear a small cry of a kitten in the evening.<br/><br/>However, this might be <strong><em>soramimi</em></strong> (空耳).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>sora</em></strong> (空) means "sky" or "phantom," and <strong><em>mimi</em></strong> (耳) means "ear" or "hearing," the literal meaning of <em>soramimi</em> is "hearing a phantom."<br/><br/>In other words, <em>soramimi</em> refers to a phenomenon that you feel as if you hear something that is not actually generated.<br/><br/>In addition, <em>soramimi</em> can also express a phenomenon in which foreign lyrics or words sound like your own language.<br/><br/>For example, the English phrase 'You know me?' sounds like <strong><em>yunomi</em></strong> (湯呑み - meaning "(Japanese) teacup") in Japanese.

空耳<br/><br/>最近、夕方になると子猫の小さな鳴き声が聞こえてきます。<br/><br/>しかしこれは「空耳」かもしれません。<br/><br/>「空」は "sky" や "phantom" を、「耳」は "ear" や "hearing" を意味するので、「空耳」の文字どおりの意味は "hearing phantom" となります。<br/><br/>すなわち「空耳」とは、実際には聞こえていない物音が聞こえたように感じるということです。<br/><br/>また、外国語の歌詞や言葉が、自分の国の言葉に聞こえる現象も、「空耳」と呼びます。<br/><br/>例えば、英語の "You know me?" は、日本語の「湯呑み」に聞こえることがります。

<p class="correction_comment">"These days" is usually used for a long /longer period of time, like when an elderly person talks about life in his later years.  "Lately" is used for much shorter periods of time, like in the last few days or so.  However, if you've been hearing a small kitten crying for the past few years or so, "these days" would be appropriate.</p>

Thank you for the correction!<br/>I've been hearing the small kitten crying for the past few weeks, so "lately" seems appropriate, as you suggested. :)
