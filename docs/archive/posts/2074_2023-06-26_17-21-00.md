# 【No. 2074】<strong><em>Han-don</strong></em> (半ドン - Half-holiday)
<div class="date">Jun 26, 2023 17:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Han-don</strong></em><br/><br/>The Japanese term <strong><em>han-don</em></strong> (半ドン) describes a day when classes or business ends before noon and the rest of the day is off.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>han</em></strong> (半) means "half," and <strong><em>don</em></strong> (ドン) comes from the Dutch "Zondag," meaning "Sunday," the literal meaning of <em>han-don</em> is "half Sunday."<br/><br/>In the past, in Japan, it was common for schools and companies to have Saturday afternoons off, and <em>han-don</em> was almost synonymous with "Saturday."<br/><br/>However, the five-day workweek system has recently become widespread, and the term <em>han-don</em> is gradually becoming obsolete.<br/><br/>Incidentally, in the Netherlands and some European countries, the four-day workweek (a three-day weekend) system is being introduced.

半ドン<br/><br/>午前中に授業や業務が終了し、午後から休みであることを「半ドン」と言います。<br/><br/>「半」は "half"、「ドン」は「日曜日」を意味するオランダ語 "Zondag" から来ているので、「半ドン」の文字どおりの意味は "half Sunday" となります。<br/><br/>かつて日本では、学校や会社において、土曜日が午後から休みであることが多く、「半ドン」は土曜日の代名詞でもありました。<br/><br/>しかし最近では週休二日制が浸透し、「半ドン」は死後となりつつあります。<br/><br/>ちなみにオランダやヨーロッパの幾つかの国では、週休3日制の導入が進みつつあります。
