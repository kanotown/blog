# <strong><em>Kettai</strong></em> (Queer-Beer)
<div class="date">Apr 24, 2017 08:55</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the term in Osaka dialect "kettai."<br/><br/>"Kettai" means that something is mysterious or strange.<br/><br/>Usage example: "kettai na yattya na" (you are queer-beer).<br/>("~ na yattya na" is also a dialect term in Kansai (Osaka), which means "you're such a ~.")<br/><br/>This term comes from "ketai," which means a result of fortune-telling or an omen, and it originally used as "ketai ga warui" ("warui" means "bad") to mean "a bad omen."<br/><br/>The "ketai ga warui" became just "ketai," then "kettai," and changed to the current meaning.<br/><br/>It is thought that "kettai" was a common Japanese term until the Meiji period, but it is mainly used only around Osaka prefecture.

けったい<br/><br/>今日は大阪弁の「けったい」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「けったい」とは「不思議なさま」や「奇妙なさま」を表す言葉です。<br/><br/>使用例：「けったいなやっちゃなぁ」<br/><br/>この言葉は、占いの結果や縁起を表す「卦体」が変化したもので、元々は「縁起が悪い」という意味で「卦体が悪い」と使われていました。<br/><br/>これが単に「卦体」と言われるようになり、現在の意味になったとされています。<br/><br/>「けったい」は明治時代頃は標準的な日本語であったと考えられていますが、現在では主に大阪周辺でのみ利用されています。
