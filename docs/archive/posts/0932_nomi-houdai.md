# 【No. 0932】<strong><em>Nomi Houdai</em></strong> (飲み放題 - All-you-can-drink)
<div class="date">Jul 7, 2017 21:25</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In weekends in Japan, you can find people who are too drunk on a train or a street.<br/><br/>I think that one of the reasons is because there are many taverns that offer "nomi houdai" (飲み放題 - all-you-can-drink) in Japan.<br/><br/>As far as I know, such supplied services are often something like that you can have any drinks including alcohol on menu for for two hours with a charge of 1500 to 2000 yen (13 to 18 dollars).<br/><br/>According to the Internet, such services seem to be rarely offered overseas.<br/><br/>Especially in France and some American states, such services are prohibited by statue.<br/>(Furthermore in France, all-you-can-drink excluding alcohol is also banned.)<br/><br/>Japan is very loose to drinking now, but since people with bad manners are increasing, regulation of alcohol is being considered.

飲み放題<br/><br/>日本では週末になると、町中や電車の中で酔っ払った人をよく見かけます。<br/><br/>この理由として、日本には「飲み放題」のサービスを提供する居酒屋が多いことが考えられます。<br/><br/>私の知る限りでは、1500円～2000円程度で、2時間お酒を何杯でも飲めるというサービスが多いです。<br/><br/>インターネットによると、海外ではこのようなサービスは少ないそうです。<br/><br/>特にフランスや幾つかのアメリカの州では、定額飲み放題でのアルコール販売は法律で禁止されているそうです。<br/>（さらにフランスでは先月、ソフトドリンクの飲み放題も禁止されたそうです。）<br/><br/>今の日本はお酒に大分緩いですが、事故やマナーの悪い人も増えていることから、お酒の規制が検討されています。
