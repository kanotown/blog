# 【No. 1101】<strong><em>Bounenkai</strong></em> (忘年会)
<div class="date">Dec 23, 2017 12:22</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
During this time of year, a lot of 忘年会 (bounenkai) are held in Japan.<br/><br/>A bounenkai is a drinking party that is held at the end of the year, in order to forget the past year.<br/><br/>There is no religious meaning or particular style.<br/><br/>The 忘 (bou) means "to forget," the 年 (nen) means "year," and the 会 (kai) means "party," so 忘年会 (bounenkai) literally means "forget the part year party."<br/><br/>I think that End of the Year Party is very similar to bounenkai.<br/><br/>Incidentally, today I will participate in a bounenkai - this is the third time this week.

忘年会<br/><br/>この時期、日本各地で忘年会が開催されます。<br/><br/>忘年会は年末に催される宴会のことで、その年の苦労を忘れるために行われます。<br/><br/>宗教的意味付けや、決まった様式などはありません。<br/><br/>「忘」は "forget," 「年」は "year," 「会」は "party" を意味し、忘年会は文字通り " forget the past year party" という意味です。<br/><br/>英語で言うところの "End of the Year Party" に近いと思います。<br/><br/>ちなみに私は今日、今週で3回目の忘年会に参加します。
