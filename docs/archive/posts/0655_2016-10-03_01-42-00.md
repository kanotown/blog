Today, I will talk about the Japanese proverb "ishibashi wo tataite wataru."<br/><br/>The literal meanings is "to cross a stone bridge after beating it," and it expresses "to do something cautiously and carefully."<br/><br/>This comes from that although stone bridges look firm, very careful people beat them for confirming safe conditions.<br/><br/>This proverb is often used to mean "someone is very careful," while it sometimes used to mean "someone is too cowardice" with irony.<br/><br/>Also, we sometimes say "ishibashi wo tataite kowasu" (to break a stone bridge by beating it too many times) for people who fail due to their carefulness, and say "ishibashi wo tataite wataranai" (not to cross a stone bridge after beating it) for people who don't act.<br/><br/>By the way, there is an English proverb "Hear twice before you speak once," which has the similar meaning.

石橋を叩いて渡る<br/><br/>今日は、日本のことわざ「石橋を叩いて渡る」を紹介します。<br/><br/>このことわざは、「ものすごく慎重に、用心深く物事を行う」ことのたとえです。<br/><br/>石橋は非常に堅固に見えますが、それでも叩いて壊れないかを確認する用心深さに由来します。<br/><br/>「用心深い」という意味で使われることもあれば、「臆病すぎる」などの皮肉を込めた意味で使われることもあります。<br/><br/>また、「慎重になりすぎて失敗した人」に対して「石橋を叩いて壊す」、「慎重になりすぎて結局行動しない人」に対して「石橋を叩いて渡らない」などと言うこともあります。<br/><br/>英語で同じ意味を表すことわざとしては、"Hear twice before you speak once" (話す前に二回聞け) があります。

 Very interesting!
 <br/>
 Those who choose not to cross the stone bring might say the English proverb "Better safe than sorry".
