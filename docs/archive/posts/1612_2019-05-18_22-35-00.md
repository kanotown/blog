# <strong><em>Isu</strong></em> (椅子 - Chair)
<div class="date">May 18, 2019 22:35</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Isu</strong></em><br/><br/>Yesterday, I introduced the Japanese <strong><em>koshikake</em></strong> (腰掛け), which means "chair" or "makeshift job."<br/><br/>However, when you want to mean "chair," it is more common to use another word, <strong><em>isu</em></strong> (椅子).<br/><br/>椅 is a kanji that means a thing or wood to lean on, and <strong><em>su</em></strong> (子) is a suffix attached to small things.<br/><br/>It is thought that this comes from the fact that most chairs in the past in Japan (or China) were made of wood.<br/><br/>The chair has a long history -- it is said that the oldest chair in the world is the chair of Queen Hetepheres used in ancient Egypt (about 2500 BC).

椅子<br/><br/>昨日は「腰掛け」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>しかし、"Chair" を意味したい場合は、「椅子」という言葉のほうがより一般的に利用されます。<br/><br/>「椅」は「寄りかかるもの」や「寄りかかる木」を意味する漢字、「子」は小さいものにつける接尾語です。<br/><br/>これは、かつて日本（もしくは中国）の多くの木製であったということに由来すると考えられます。<br/><br/>椅子の歴史は古く、現存する世界最古の椅子は古代エジプト（紀元前約2500年）のへテプへレス王妃の椅子だと言われています。

<p class="correction_comment">Your sentence is correct. But I think it might be more common to use the word "say" instead of "mean."</p>

 I hadn't researched it, but I always wondered about the 子 in this word, and how it related to the meaning. Your explanation makes sense, though ^^
