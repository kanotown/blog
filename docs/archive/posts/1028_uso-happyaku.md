<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Have you ever been surrounded by a lot of lies?<br/><br/>Such a situation where as if everything is lie is called "uso happyaku" (嘘八百) in Japan.<br/><br/>Here "uso" (嘘) means "lie," and "happyaku" (八百) means "eight hundred."<br/><br/>In Japan, eight hundred is a number that represents that the number of things is huge.<br/><br/>It is said that this comes from the fact that the number <em>eight</em> has been used for saying an enormous number in Buddhism.<br/><br/>Incidentally, "uso happyaku" can also means "a complete lie," in addition to "a lot of lies."

嘘八百<br/><br/>たくさんの嘘に囲まれたことはありますか？<br/><br/>このように何もかも嘘だらけであることを、日本語で「嘘八百」と言います。<br/><br/>ここで「嘘」は "lie," 「八百」は "eight hundred" を意味します。<br/><br/>日本において、「八百」は物事の数が非常に多いことを意味する数字です。<br/><br/>これは、仏教において「8」という数字が、膨大な数を表す際に使われたことに由来すると言われています。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「嘘八百」は多くの嘘だけでなく、まったくの嘘を表すこともあります。
