7-Eleven<br/><br/>先日、私の大学構内でセブンイレブンが開店しました。<br/><br/>とても便利になりそうです。<br/><br/>セブンイレブンは1927年、テキサス州ダラスの氷屋から始まりました。<br/><br/>かつては冷蔵庫が一般的ではなく、食料品の保存には氷が使われていました。<br/><br/>そして氷屋で働いてた「ジェファーソン・グリーン」は、氷の他に、ミルクやパン、卵などを売り始めたそうです（「トーテム・ストア」）。<br/><br/>このアイデアがヒットし、文字どおり「コンビニエンスストア（便利な店）」となったというわけです。<br/><br/>1946年には、朝7時から夜11時まで毎日営業するお店として、「7-Eleven」という名前になり、世界中に急速に広まりました。

 Ironically, 7-Eleven is not very common in my state, lol.

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>Interestingly, also in Japan, major convenience stores vary from the region (there are few 7-Eleven in some prefectures).

Could you tell me the most common convenience store/corner shop in your state?
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">artboy598</span><br>
We don’t have a major chain like 7-Eleven most places.  Most of the stores are privately owned and operated. So, they all have different names.

Thank you, I understand. Sounds nice, I like such stores under individual management. There are too many chain stores in Japan.
