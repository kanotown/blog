吐き気<br/><br/>昨日は、朝起きてからずっと吐き気がしていました。<br/><br/>気分が悪かったのですが、教員と大学1年生との懇親会が予定されていたので、なんとか学校に行きました。<br/><br/>しかし、吐き気がひどくなり、食べたもの、飲んだものを全て吐き戻してしまいました。<br/><br/>座っていても、横になっていても、とても辛かったです。<br/><br/>何かの病気やウィルスを移してしまっても申し訳ないので、残念でしたが懇親会は諦めて大人しく帰ることにしました。<br/><br/>この日は一日中吐き気に見舞われ、Lang-8への投稿もできませんでした。<br/><br/>幸い、一日何も食べずにいたら少し気分が良くなりました。
