サザエさん [Part 1]<br/><br/>今日は日本の国民的アニメ、サザエさんを紹介します。<br/><br/>サザエさんは1969年から放送が始まり、今年で46年目になります。<br/><br/>放送回数は2350回、話数は7000話を超えています。<br/><br/>最も長く放映されているTVアニメとして、ギネスブックにも載りました。<br/><br/>サザエさんは日常系のアニメで、放送の最後にじゃんけんをするのがこのアニメの特徴の一つです。<br/><br/>また、サザエさんは、作者の意向により、一切DVDなどが発売されていません。<br/><br/>そのため、もう二度と見ることができない話が多数あります。<br/><br/>Part2 に続きます。
