水菓子<br/><br/>「水」は "water," 「菓子」は "sweets" もしくは "snacks" を意味します。<br/><br/>あなたはこの二つを組み合わせた「水菓子」という言葉を聞いて、何を思い浮かべますか？<br/><br/>実は「水菓子」は「果物」を表します。<br/><br/>昔は、果物など、正式な食事以外の軽い食べ物全般を「菓子」と呼んでいました。<br/><br/>その中でも、スイカや梨など、水気を含む果物のことを「水菓子」と呼ぶようになりました。<br/><br/>現在では「果物」という言葉が一般的に使わるため、「水菓子」と聞いて「水分を多く含んだ菓子」を想像する日本人が増えています。<br/>（水分を多く含む菓子は、「生菓子」と言います。）<br/><br/>実際、「水菓子」で画像検索しても、果物はほとんど出てきません。

 I learned about mizugashi on an episode of Detective Conan.
</p>
