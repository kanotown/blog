# 【No. 1805】<strong><em>Nekoze</em></strong> (猫背 - Rounded Back)
<div class="date">Apr 5, 2021 12:07</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Nekoze</em></strong><br/><br/>Many Japanese people have <strong><em>nekoze</em></strong> (猫背).<br/><br/><em>Nekoze</em> is a posture in which one's back is curved, and the head is protruded. It can be translated into English as "hunched posture" or "rounded/curved back."<br/><br/>Since <em>neko</em> means "cat" and <strong><em>ze/se</em></strong> (背) means "back," the literal meaning of <em>nekoze</em> is "cat back."<br/><br/>As you know, cats' backs are basically rounded.<br/><br/>That is to say, the Japanese term <em>nekoze</em> was made by comparing humans<em> curved backs to cats</em> backs.<br/><br/>Please note that <strong><em>nekoze</em></strong> (of human) could lead to various uncomfortable symptoms such as indigestion, tiredness, and headaches.

猫背<br/><br/>日本人は「猫背」である人が多いです。<br/><br/>「猫背」は背中が丸まって、頭部が前方に出た姿勢のことで、英語では "hunched posture" や "rounded/curved back" などと訳されるようです。<br/><br/>「猫」は "cat"、「背」は "back" を意味するので、「猫背」の文字どおりの意味は "cat back" となります。<br/><br/>猫の背中は基本的に丸まっています。<br/><br/>日本語の「猫背」は、人間の丸まった背中を猫の背中に例えているというわけです。<br/><br/>猫背は、消化不良や疲労感、頭痛などさまざまな病症に繋がる可能性があるので、気をつけてください。

Thank you for the correction!<br/><br/>&gt; Interesting, is this because they bow a lot, or some other reason?<br/>"Bowing too much" is an interesting theory. However, it is said that the major reason is Japanese ancestors were agricultural people who did not hunt much. :)
