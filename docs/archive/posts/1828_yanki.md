# 【No. 1828】<strong><em>Yankī</strong></em> (ヤンキー - "bad boy/girl")
<div class="date">Apr 28, 2021 17:48</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Yankī</strong></em><br/><br/>In my post yesterday, I introduced the Japanese term <strong><em>furyō</em></strong> (不良), which means "bad state/boy/girl."<br/><br/>To express "bad boy/girl," you can also say <strong><em>yankī</em></strong> (ヤンキー) instead of <em>furyō</em>.<br/><br/><em>Yankī</em> came from the slang term "Yankee," which refers to people from the Northern United States.<br/><br/>In Japan, young people who wander the streets while wearing flashy clothes such as Hawaiian shirts were called <em>yankī</em>. Later, <em>yankī</em> has come to refer to "bad boy/girl."<br/><br/>Incidentally, when the <em>yankī</em> is not so aggressive and bad, and loves the hometown, he/she is sometimes called <strong><em>mairudo yankī</em></strong> (マイルドヤンキー - "mild-mannered bad boy/girl").

ヤンキー<br/><br/>昨日は "bad state/boy/girl" を意味する「不良」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>"Bad boy/girl" を意味する俗称として、「ヤンキー」という言葉もあります。<br/><br/>「ヤンキー」は、北部アメリカ人を意味する俗語 Yankee から来ています。<br/><br/>日本では、アロハシャツなどの派手な服装をして街をうろつく若者のことを「ヤンキー」と呼ぶようになり、「不良少年/少女」を指すようになったと考えられています。<br/><br/>また、ヤンキー程の攻撃性・違法性がなく、地域指向が強い若者のことを、「マイルドヤンキー」と呼ぶことがあります。

 It's interesting how a lot of ヤンキー are conservative and nationalistic, yet their looks are actually based on how foreigners dress.  Many even dye their hair lighter, so they prefer to have a caucasian hair colour than their own natural hair colour.

I just think it's funny that some people who are nationalistic and don't want foreigners in Japan are totally influenced by Western culture.
