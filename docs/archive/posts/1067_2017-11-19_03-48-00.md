<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Nodo</strong></em> (喉 - Throat)</h1>
<div class="date">Nov 19, 2017 03:48</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I have a sore "nodo" (喉) now.<br/><br/>"Nodo" refers to a back of your mouth, where the part above your esophagus and trachea -- it's a throat.<br/><br/>In the past, this Japanese word is called "nomido" (のみど).<br/><br/>The "nomi" (のみ) means "to drink" and the "do/to" (ど/と) means "door," so the combination "nomido" refers to "door for drinking." <br/><br/>I think that it's not necessary to explain any more why "nodo" has come to mean "throat."<br/><br/>Also, "nodo" can mean "singing voice," "weak point," and "a part that binds a book."

喉<br/><br/>私は今、喉が痛いです。<br/><br/>「喉」は、口の奥、食道と気管の上の部分を指します。<br/><br/>この言葉はかつては「のみど」と呼ばれていました。<br/><br/>「のみ」は "drink," 「ど」は "door" を意味するため、「のみど」は "door for drinking" （飲むための入り口）を表します。<br/><br/>これが "throat" を意味するようになった理由は、説明するまでもないと思います。<br/><br/>また、「喉」は「歌声」や「急所」、「本を綴じる部分」などを意味することもあります。
