<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
First International Conference in a While<br/><br/>Today, I participated in an international conference and made a presentation in English for the first time in about two years.<br/><br/>It was an online conference using Zoom, but I was very nervous.<br/><br/>In particular, the problem was the question and answer session after my presentation.<br/><br/>I was not confident that I could answer English questions immediately and well.<br/><br/>Since the first question was simple, I managed to answer it.<br/><br/>However, I could not understand the intent of the second question.<br/><br/>Eventually, I had no idea what to say, and barely said "umm, it's a difficult question for me...," then the questioner said something like "okay" and the session was over.<br/><br/>I must study harder.

久しぶりの国際会議<br/><br/>今日は、約2年ぶりに国際会議で英語で発表しました。<br/><br/>Zoomを用いたオンライン会議でしたが、とても緊張しました。<br/><br/>発表はなんとか終わったものの、問題はその後の質疑応答です。<br/><br/>英語を聞き、即座にうまく答えられる自信がありませんでした。<br/><br/>1人目の質問は簡単な内容だったので、なんとか答えることができましたが、2人目の質問はうまく内容を理解できませんでした。<br/><br/>結局、なんと言ってよいかわからず、" umm, it's a difficult question for me..." と返したら "okay" のように言われて、質疑が終わってしまいました。<br/><br/>もっと精進します。

"It was an online conference that used Zoom, but I was very nervous nonetheless." Sorry, nonetheless works better than nevertheless in that line above.<br/>
