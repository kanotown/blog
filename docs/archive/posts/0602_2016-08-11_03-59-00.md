山の日<br/><br/>今日、8月11日は山の日です。<br/><br/>山の日は、「山に親しむ機会を得て、山の恩恵に感謝する」ことを趣旨とした日です。<br/><br/>実は、山に関する出来事などには特に由来していません。<br/><br/>日本山岳会などの団体が2010年から制定を要求し、2014年に制定され、2016年から施行されました。<br/><br/>すなわち、今日は最初の山の日です。<br/><br/>最初は山開きに合わせて6月にしようとしていたそうですが、8月のお盆休みと繋げたほうが都合が良いことから、8月になったようです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、私の大学は8月10日から一斉休暇だったため、山の日の影響はありません。

<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">Today, August 11th is Mountain Day.</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
Today, August 11th<span class="f_blue">,</span> is Mountain Day.
<p class="correction_comment">"August 11th" is an appositive. It adds detail to "Today." We put commas before and after appositives. They work like parentheses: Today (August 11th) is Mountain Day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">The purpose of Mountain Day is "to obtain an opportunity to become familiar with mountains, and to thank to benefits of the mountains."</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
The purpose of Mountain Day is "to become familiar with mountains and to be thankful for the benefits of mountains."
<p class="correction_comment">You could also say: "The purpose of Mountain Day is 'to learn about mountains and recognize the benefits of mountains.' " I am assuming that you are quoting some other source in this sentence.</p>

<li class="corrected correct">
Some organizations, such as the Japanese Alpine Club, had requested the establishment of Mountain Day since 2010. The day was finally established in 2014 and executed in 2016.
<p class="correction_comment">I would write this: Since 2010, organizations, such as the Japanese Alpine Club, had been calling for the creation of a Mountain Day. In 2014 the day was established. However, it was not until 2016 that the first Mountain Day occurred.</p>

<li class="corrected correct">
However, since it was convenient for many people to connect the day to Bon vacation, it was placed in August.
<p class="correction_comment">This sentence is confusing. I think you could also put this: Mountain Day is in August because it was convenient to have it line up with Bon vacation.</p>
