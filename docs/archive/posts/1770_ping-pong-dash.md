ピンポンダッシュ<br/><br/>日本では最近「Uber Eats」や「出前館」というフードデリバリーサービスが浸透してきていますが、アメリカでは「ドアダッシュ」のシェアが1位になっていると聞きました。<br/><br/>2021年1月、「ドアダッシュ」は日本にも進出したようです。<br/><br/>とても優れたサービスを提供するようですが、この企業名は日本では「ピンポンダッシュ」を連想する恐れがあります。<br/><br/>「ピンポン」は家の呼び鈴の音（卓球ではありません）、「ダッシュ」は "dash" のことで、「ピンポンダッシュ」は呼び鈴を押して走って逃げるイタズラのことを表します。<br/><br/>厳密には「迷惑防止条例違反」や「住居侵入罪」に該当する犯罪行為ですので、決してしないようにしてください。

 Many exported products have failed because they had a name that didn't sound good in the target country's language. BTW, in English, the onomatopoeia for the sound of a doorbell is "ding-dong".

Personally, to me "ding-ding" is the sound of the bell on a bike.

Thank you so much for letting me know that!<br/>Ah, although my dictionary said "ding-dong ditch,"  I mistakenly wrote "ding ding ditch." :P
