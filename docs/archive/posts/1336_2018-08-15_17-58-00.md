<div class="date">Aug 15, 2018 17:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Fūrin</strong></em><br/><br/>Three years ago, I wrote an article about <strong><em>fūrin</em></strong> (風鈴 - wind bell).<br/><br/>Today I would like to talk about fūrin in more detail.<br/><br/><strong><em>Fū</em></strong> (風) means "wind" and <strong><em>rin</em></strong> (鈴) means "bell."<br/><br/>Therefore, fūrin is a bell that sounds by taking the wind as the characters indicate.<br/><br/>In the past, fūrin was used as a tool of fortune telling in China.<br/><br/>This was imported to Japan as an amulet tool when the time Buddhism was introduced.<br/><br/>Then, over a long period of time, it has changed to an item that represents summer.

風鈴<br/><br/>約三年前、私は「風鈴」についての記事を書きました。<br/><br/>今日は「風鈴」について、もう少し詳しく紹介します。<br/><br/>「風」は "wind," 「鈴」は "bell" を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち風鈴とは、風を受けて音が鳴る鈴というわけです。<br/><br/>かつて風鈴は、中国で占いの道具として使われていました。<br/><br/>これが日本に、魔除けの道具として伝わったそうです。<br/><br/>そして長い年月をかけ、夏の風物詩へと変化していったそうです。

In English, a bell like this is usually called a wind "chime" (chime is a word used for the sound of a bell ringing) :)

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/><br/>Haha, 風鈴母さん sounds interesting.<br/>Yes, when hearing the term, Japanese people probably image someone's mother who rings a wind chime frequently.
