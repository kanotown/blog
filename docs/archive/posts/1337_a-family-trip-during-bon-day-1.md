# 【No. 1337】A Family Trip during Bon Day 1
<div class="date">Aug 16, 2018 23:42</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A Family Trip during Bon Day 1<br/><br/>I went to Azumino city, Nagano, with my family and relatives during the last two days of Bon holidays (that is, from August 14th to 15th).<br/><br/>First, we visited Daiō Wasabi Farm (大王わさび農場 - literally "King wasabi farm"), then saw the wasabi farm and ate dishes that use wasabi.<br/><br/>Transparent water on the farm was very beautiful, and the wasabi dishes were delicious.<br/><br/>After that, we checked in at a hotel, got into a hot spring, and went to a fireworks display.<br/><br/>We really enjoyed a grand display of 12,000 fireworks in the night sky.

お盆の親族旅行1日目<br/><br/>私はお盆休みの最終日二日間（すなわち8月14～15日）を利用して、親族と長野の安曇野市に遊びに行きました。<br/><br/>まずは大王わさび農場に行き、わさび園を見たり、わさびを使った料理を食べたりしました。<br/><br/>透き通った水がとても綺麗で、わさび料理も美味しかったです。<br/><br/>その後旅館に行き、温泉に入ってから花火大会に行きました。<br/><br/>夜空に広がる1万2千発の花火をじっくり楽しむことができました。
