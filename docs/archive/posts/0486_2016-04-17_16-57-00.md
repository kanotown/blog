<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are many Japanese phrases that were derived from Katana.<br/><br/>Today, I will talk about two phrases of them.<br/><br/>・Moto no saya ni osamaru (katana is sheathed) ･･･ to get back together.<br/><br/>Once you unsheathe katana, it's difficult to fit other scabbards, but it's easy to fit the original scabbard.<br/><br/>For this reason, the phrase was born.<br/><br/>・Nukiuchi ･･･ to conduct something suddenly without any advance notice.<br/><br/>Originally, nukiuchi meant to unsheathe katana and cut someone simultaneously.<br/><br/>However, this phrase came to be used in various situations.<br/><br/>For example, we refer to a test that is conducted without notice as "nukiuchi test."

刀から派生した言葉<br/><br/>日本語には、刀から派生した言葉が沢山あります。<br/><br/>今日はその中から、二つの言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「元の鞘に収まる」・・・一度別れたカップルがヨリを戻すこと。<br/><br/>一度鞘から抜いた刀は、違う鞘には収まりにくく、元の鞘にはすんなり収まることから、この言葉ができました。<br/><br/>「抜き打ち」・・・予告無しに、突然何かを行うこと。<br/><br/>刀を抜くと同時に斬りかかることを抜き打ちといい、それが転じて色々な場面で使われるようになりました。<br/><br/>例えば、予告無しに行うテストを「抜き打ちテスト」と言います。

 Hmm, don't think you explained 'Moto no saya ni osamaru' clearly enough. Does it mean once you cause yourself to be in a situation, it won't be able to go back to the way it was?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Haha.

Thank you very much always for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; Hmm, don't think you explained 'Moto no saya ni osamaru' clearly enough. Does it mean once you cause yourself to be in a situation, it won't be able to go back to the way it was? <br/><br/>Ah, I'm sorry. My explanation wasn't enough.<br/>This phrase means that a couple (who broke up) get back together again.<br/>（このフレーズの意味は、別れたカップルが復縁することです。）
