10000単語<br/><br/>私は最近、大学のオンライン学習サイトで毎日40-60の英単語の勉強をしています。<br/><br/>そして昨日、勉強した単語数がようやく10000に達しました。<br/><br/>残り2000単語で、全ての学習が終わります（もちろん復習は続きます）。<br/><br/>しかし、勉強を進めるにつれて単語の難しさが上がってくるため、時間がかかって辛いです。<br/><br/>今日は学んだ単語を忘れないようにするため、例文を作る練習をしてみます。<br/><br/>その薄汚くて忌まわしい官僚は、慎重に使い古された悪口を吐き捨てた。<br/>（The dingy and abominable bureaucrat spat out hackneyed epithets in a circumspect way.）

<p class="correction_comment">"have been learning" more natural. It says that you are continually learning.<br/><br/>"everyday" and "every day" has a slightly different meaning. "Every day" is correct for what you want to say. <br/>"Everyday" is an adjective, eg. ' It's my everyday routine.'</p>
