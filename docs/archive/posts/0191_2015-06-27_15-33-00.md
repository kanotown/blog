# Konjac
<div class="date">Jun 27, 2015 15:33</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Konjac that's also called devil's tongue is a Japanese food.<br/><br/>It is made from konnyaku imo that contains a deadly poison, calcium oxalate.<br/><br/>If we take in the poison, our mouth and throat will become swollen, then we will choke.<br/><br/>Finally we will be in coma or die as the case may be.<br/><br/>In order to remove poison and eat konjac, we have to do many processing steps.<br/><br/>The processed konjac have a unique texture, but there is no nutrition or calories.<br/><br/>Because of the small amount of calories, it is often introduced as a diet food.<br/><br/>I don't know, we don't know why we have become to eat it.<br/><br/>It is said that the reason might be due to food crisis.

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>&gt; i saw in anime that konjac is use to scare people ?<br/>&gt; but i dont know its a food.<br/>Oh, really? <br/>If someone say 'konjac' in Japan, it means a healthy food in almost every case.

Konjac has a really unique texture, but actually there is almost no taste.<br/>It is often used as an ingredient of a stewed dish like oden.<br/>Eventually, by absorbing various taste of seasonings, it will be delicious, haha.
