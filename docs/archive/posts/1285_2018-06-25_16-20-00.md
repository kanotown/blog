Mokuhyō and Mokuteki Part 2<br/><br/>Today I would like to introduce you to the difference between mokuhyō (目標) and mokuteki (目的); even Japanese people often confuse them.<br/><br/>As the word teki (的 - target) indicates, 'mokuteki' is your final goal, and it should be the essential answer to the reason you act.<br/><br/>On the other hand, as the word hyō (標 - mark) indicates, 'mokuhyō' are specific goals/aims/objectives to achieve your final goal.<br/><br/>In summary, 'mokuteki' is your abstract final goal, whereas 'mokuhyō' are specific goals for achievement in the final goal.<br/><br/>For example, my mokuteki in life is to become a researcher who is active in the front lines in the world, and my mokuhyō to achieve this mokuteki are the followings: writing English on Lang-8 every day, reading a paper every week, and submitting a paper to a scientific journal every year.

目標と目的 Part 2<br/><br/>今日は、日本人でも間違える「目標」と「目的」の違いを紹介します。<br/><br/>「目的」は、最終的に目指すゴールのことであり、あなたが行動する理由の本質的な答えです。<br/><br/>一方で「目標」は、「標（目印）」という字が示すように、目的を達成する上での具体的な道しるべです。<br/><br/>まとめると、「目的」は抽象的な最終ゴール、「目標」は具体的な達成項目です。<br/><br/>例えば、私の人生の目的は「世界で活躍する研究者になること」であり、この目的を達成するための目標として「毎日Lang-8に投稿すること」「週に1本は論文を読むこと」「年に1本は論文を投稿すること」などを定めています。

<li class="corrected correct">
As the <span class="f_blue">kanji </span>teki (的 - target) indicates, 'mokuteki' is your final goal, and it should be the essential answer to the reason you act.
<p class="correction_comment">(kanji as an alternative to distinguish between the word mokuteki and the part of the word, the kanji, that is teki)<br/><br/>"answer to the reason you act" is similar to yesterday's "rather" situation. I read this one time through and didn't really take note. However, the second time, it stands out. Answer and reason aren't typical collocations. It doesn't mean they can't be used together, but it's not a typical usage. For instance, answer and problem or answer and question are much stronger collocations.<br/><br/>"...the essential answer to why you act."  (this might work since why is a question word)<br/>" ...the ultimate purpose for your actions." (different words - purpose and target are related)<br/>....other possibilities exist, I'm sure.<br/><br/>"it should be" also stands out a little bit. You may have chosen it because it has a nuance of correcting people's, even Japanese people's, mistaken use of mokuteki to refer to other concepts. If you don't want this nuance, you could say:<br/><br/>"it points to" <br/>"it signifies" <br/><br/>These sound more matter of fact regarding the nature of the word's meaning.</p>

<li class="incorrect">On the other hand, as the word hyō (標 - mark) indicates, 'mokuhyō' are specific goals/aims/objectives to achieve your final goal.</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
On the other hand, as the <span class="f_blue">element </span>hyō (標 - mark) indicates, 'mokuhyō' are specific goals, aims, or objectives, steps taken to achieve your final goal.
<p class="correction_comment">(element as another alternative)<br/><br/>Using slashes as you did works for a blog post or informal writing. My corrections take it to a more formal structure.<br/><br/>I also turned the last part of your sentence into an appositive (I think that's the linguistic term). Basically, it's a type of "つまり" phrase which reverbalizes what those goals, aims, or objectives are. <br/><br/>I don't think the structure/semantics of "objectives to achieve your final goal" works well. "motivation to achieve one's final goal" works, but not goals, aims, objectives. I honestly can't say why.</p>

</ul>
<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">In summary, 'mokuteki' is your abstract final goal, whereas 'mokuhyō' are specific goals for achievement in the final goal.</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
In summary, 'mokuteki' is your abstract<span class="f_red">,</span> final goal, whereas 'mokuhyō' are discrete tasks completed on your way to that goal.
<p class="correction_comment">As you wrote it, achievement goes to the "specific goals." But as you are explaining it, those are supposed to be smaller. So achieve has the wrong connotation. Also, you use "goal" 3 times in the sentence which doesn't help to establish the distinction you are trying to evoke. There are other ways to end the sentence I offer here.</p>

<li class="corrected correct">
For example, my mokuteki in life is to become a researcher who is active <span class="f_blue">on </span>the front lines <span class="f_red">in the world</span>, and my mokuhyō to achieve this mokuteki are the following<span class="sline">s</span>: writing <span class="f_blue">in</span> English on Lang-8 every day, reading a <span class="f_red">paper </span>every week, and submitting a paper to a scientific journal every year.
<p class="correction_comment">For me, "on" is a more typical collocation with "front lines." <br/><br/>"In the world" is somewhat vague sounding. I think when you say "front lines" people are expecting a specific issue, location, purpose, or context: "on the front lines to end child labor"  or "on the front lines of AI research."<br/><br/>The meaning of "paper" becomes clear with your third mokuteki, but you may want to specify there so the reader isn't left wondering:<br/><br/>reading a scientific/research article</p>

 You might have started this entry with a reference to yesterday's entry. For those of us who read yesterday's, it would provide that connection, for those who missed it, it would provide a reason to check it out, perhaps.

 <br/>
 Agreed with Pillows. Great mokuteki and mokuhyo!

Thank you so much the corrections and helpful comments!<br/>I would like to be able to handle various English terms and expressions well.<br/><br/>By the way, I divide my post into two parts when I think it might exceed 200 words, haha.
