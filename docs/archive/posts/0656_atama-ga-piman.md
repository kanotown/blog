# 【No. 0656】<strong><em>Atama ga Piman</em></strong> (Your Head is a Green Pepper)
<div class="date">Oct 4, 2016 07:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese insult "atama ga piman," whose literal meaning is "your head is a green pepper."<br/><br/>This phrase expresses something like that "you have no brains."<br/><br/>The etymology is very simple: green peppers have large hollows in their insides.<br/><br/>In a similar way, there is a Japanese insult "hanashi ga piman," (your talk is a green pepper), which means "your talk is empty."<br/><br/>Note that these phrases were popular in the 1970s, and we rarely use them today.<br/><br/>By the way, if you say just "piman" (a green pepper) to someone, it can be an insult that means "your have no brains" or "you're empty."

頭がピーマン<br/><br/>今日は、野菜を使った悪口「頭がピーマン」を紹介します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、「頭が空っぽ」ということを意味します。<br/><br/>語源は単純で、ピーマンの中身はすかすかだからです。<br/><br/>同様に、「話の中身が無い」ことを意味する「話がピーマン」という言葉もあります。<br/><br/>これらの言葉は1970年代に流行し、現在ではほとんど使われていないことに注意して下さい。<br/><br/>ちなみに、単に「ピーマン」と言っても「頭が空っぽ」「中身がない」などの悪口になり得えます。

Thank you so much for correcting my post :)<br/><br/>Actually, since I heard that the usage of "whose" is grammatically okay even when the antecedent isn't a person, I used it. I was also told that otherwise I should write ", the literal meaning of which is..."

Yes, I think its OK to say whose, but its not really correct, so feel free to keep using it. :)

Your post made me laugh. My husband hates green peppers so he thought this was pretty funny too.  This is a great expression.  Thanks! <br/><br/>As for:  Today, I will talk about the Japanese insult "atama ga piman," whose literal meaning is "your head is a green pepper."<br/>This kind of usage of "whose" is fine for speech or casual writing, it just isn't formally correct.

Did you know the broccoli throwing scene in "Inside Out" was changed to piman throwing in Japan? Because western kids hate broccoli, but Japanese kids hate piman! Isn't that interesting?

That's great!  My family likes broccoli and my husband and child hate green peppers so I think they'd like the Japanese version better!

 Interesting post, Kano san ^^
 <br/>
 質問があります：日本語での最後の文章は「ちなみに、単に「ピーマン」と言っても「頭が空っぽ」「中身がない」などの悪口になり得えます。」です。その「なり得えます」の読み方と意味は何ですか？
</p>

Hi, Sharu san :)<br/>The reading of "なり得ます" is "nariemasu," and means something like "it can be."<br/><br/>「なり得る」は以下のように言い換えることもできます。<br/>・ 「なる可能性がある」<br/>・ 「なるかもしれない」
</div>

I see. ありがとうございます。
