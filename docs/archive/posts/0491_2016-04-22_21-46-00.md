# Takenoko Nyokki
<div class="date">Apr 22, 2016 21:46</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the game "takenoko nyokki," which had been played in a Japanese TV program.<br/><br/>"Takenoko" means a bamboo shoot, and "nyokki" is an onomatopoeic word that represents a growth.<br/><br/>(Yesterday, I talked about "gnocchi," but its reading in Japan is completely the same as the reading of "nyokki.")<br/><br/>This game is normally played by around six persons, and it begins with a call "takenoko, takenoko, nyokkikki!" while joining their palms.<br/><br/>After that, players declare "1 nyokki!" "2 nyokki!" in order while raising their hands.<br/><br/>The declaration order is not determined, but if more than one person declare the same number, all of them will get defeated.<br/><br/>In addition, the last person who didn't declare will also get defeated.<br/><br/>Although this is a simple game, it's psychological and difficult to win.

たけのこニョッキ<br/><br/>今日は、日本のTV番組で行われていた、「たけのこニョッキ」という遊びを紹介します。<br/><br/>「ニョッキ」は、何かが（ここではたけのこが）ぐんぐん伸びる様を表す擬態語です。<br/><br/>（昨日は料理の「ニョッキ」について話しましたが、日本では擬態語の「ニョッキ」と全く同じ発音です。）<br/><br/>このゲームは６人程度で行うもので、まず、「たけのこ、たけのこ、ニョッキッキ」というコールで始まります。<br/><br/>そして、手を合掌して上に突き上げながら、順番に「１ニョッキ！」「２ニョッキ！」と宣言していきます。<br/><br/>宣言する順番は決まっていませんが、同じ数字を複数人が同時に言った場合、その人達は負けになります。<br/><br/>また、最後まで残ってしまった人も負けになります。<br/><br/>シンプルですが、心理的なゲームで、なかなか神経を使います。
