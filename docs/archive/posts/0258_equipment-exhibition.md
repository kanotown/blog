今日は、東京で開催された大規模な機器展示会に行ってきました。<br/><br/>最先端の分析装置や検査技術を知ることができました。<br/><br/>さらに、様々な企業の方と情報交換することができて、とても充実した日となりました。<br/><br/>ただ、東京はすごく蒸し暑くて、人が多すぎます。<br/><br/>私は東京に来ると、必ず頭が痛くなります。<br/><br/>田舎に戻ってゆっくりと休みたいです。

<p class="correction_comment">'I hardly want to (do something)' means you don't want to do it. I assume you meant you wanted to relax in the countryside, since Tokyo gives you a headache. If you meant that you don't like the countryside though, this sentence is perfect.</p>

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>Also, thank you for guessing what I wanted to mean.<br/>Actually, I wanted to write something like "I hardly wait to relax..." haha.

Oh! In that case, 'I can hardly wait to (do something)' is the proper phrase. It's like you're really excited to relax to in the countryside ^_^
