ぼったくり<br/><br/>私は今、イタリアにいます。<br/><br/>そして、あるピザ屋さんで「ぼったくり」にあってしまいました。<br/><br/>「ぼったくり」とは、法外な料金を要求することを意味する日本語です。<br/><br/>私は4ユーロのケバブを一つ注文しました。<br/><br/>注文後すぐにお金をレジに置いたら、お金は回収されました。<br/><br/>そしてケバブが完成したとき、さらに4ユーロを請求されました。<br/><br/>私はもう既に払っただろうと何度か訴えましたが、店主は聞く耳を持ってくれませんでした。<br/><br/>恐らくですが、私が最初に置いたお金は、別の人のピザ代として計上されたのかもしれません（別の人がピザを一切れ頼んでいて、彼はお金を払っていないように見えた）。<br/><br/>結局合計8ユーロ支払うことになってしまって、悔しいです。

 I'm surprised that they didn't have any way of keeping track how much you paid. The store I work at usually gives people another sandwich for free if they didn't like the one they got even if they don't have a receipt to prove it. That store owner is pretty bad at customer service or his business is tanking hard if four euros is going to break his bank xD

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/>Yes, I was also surprised by the sloppy work. I hope that other stores are not like this...
