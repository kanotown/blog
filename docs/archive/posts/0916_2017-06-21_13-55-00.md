# <strong><em>Futodoki</strong></em> (不届き - Unscrupulous)
<div class="date">Jun 21, 2017 13:55</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are several terms that mean something thoughtless, but today I'd like to introduce the term "futodoki" among them, that tends to be used by high-ranked people (this tendency is my opinion).<br/><br/>"Fu" means a denial and "todoki" means to reach, so the literal meaning of futodoki is "not to reach something," and formerly it was used in this meaning.<br/><br/>Later, "principle" and "law" came to be applied as the object that you don't reach, then futodoki has come to mean actions that counter to principles or laws.<br/><br/>Recently, the meaning of futodoki has expanded further -- it often means something outrageous, careless, or insensitive.<br/><br/>Incidentally, a person who have such a character is called "futodoki mono" (不届き者).

不届き<br/><br/>「非常識」を表す言葉はいろいろとありますが、今日はその中でも少し格式の高い人が使う傾向にある（と私は思う）「不届き」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「不」は打ち消しを意味するため、不届きの文字どおりの意味は「届かないこと」であり、かつてはこの意味で使われていました。<br/><br/>後に、この届かない対象に「道理」や「法」が当てられ、道理や法に背いた行為を指すようになりました。<br/><br/>現在では更に意味が広がり、「不埒なこと」や「注意・配慮に欠けたこと」を意味するようになっています。<br/><br/>そのような人を指す場合は特に、「不届き者」と言います。
