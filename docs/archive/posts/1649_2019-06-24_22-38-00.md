# 【No. 1649】<strong><em>Shiodoki</strong></em> (潮時 - Time/Chance)
<div class="date">Jun 24, 2019 22:38</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Shiodoki</strong></em><br/><br/>Everything has its <strong><em>shiodoki</em></strong> (潮時).<br/><br/><strong><em>Shio</em></strong> (潮) means "tide" abd <strong><em>doki/toki</em></strong> (時) means "time," so the literal meaning of <em>shiodoki</em> is "time when the tide comes in and goes out."<br/> <br/>Originally, <em>shiodoki</em> was used to its literal meaning among fishermen.<br/><br/>For the fishermen, such moments of high tide and low tide were one of the most important indicators to decide when to go out to sea.<br/><br/>Because of this, <em>shiodoki</em> came to be widely used as a word that means the best time to start or finish something.<br/><br/>Incidentally, about 40% of Japanese people mistake the meaning of <em>shiodoki</em> to be "time to quit/leave (in a negative sense)."

潮時<br/><br/>あらゆる物事には「潮時」があります。<br/><br/>「潮」は "tide"、「時」は "time" を意味するので、「潮時」の文字どおりの意味は "time when the tide comes in and goes out" となります。<br/><br/>もともと「潮時」は漁師の間で使われた言葉で、文字どおり「潮の満ち引きが起こる時間」を意味していました。<br/><br/>漁師にとって潮の満ち引きは、漁に出るタイミングを図る一つの指標になっていました。<br/><br/>このことから「潮時」は、「物事を始めたり終えたりするのにちょうど良い時期」を意味する言葉として広く使われるようになったというわけです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、約4割の日本人は「潮時」の意味を「引き際」と勘違いしているようです。
