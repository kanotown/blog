Andesu melons (アンデスメロン)  are sold in Japanese markets.<br/><br/>You might think that this melon is related to Andes Mountains or Andean something from this name.<br/><br/>However, the andesu melon is a kind of melon that was developed by a Japanese company, and it is not related to Andes mountains at all.<br/><br/>Since this melon is easy to grow and you can feel relieved, it was originally planned to be sold as "Anshindesu melon" ("anshin" means "to feel relieved").<br/><br/>However, it lacked a sense of humor.<br/><br/>Also, since you would remove a melon core (that is called "しん (shin)" in Japanese) before eating it, "anshindesu melon" seemed to become "andesu melon" by removing "shin."

アンデスメロン<br/><br/>日本の市場にはアンデスメロンが売られていることがあります。<br/><br/>この名前から、アンデス山脈が関係しているメロンと思われるかもしれません。<br/><br/>しかし、アンデスメロンは日本の企業が開発した品種のメロンで、アンデス山脈は全く関係ありません。<br/><br/>栽培が容易なこのメロンは、もともと「作って安心」「売って安心」「買って安心」ということから、「安心ですメロン」という名前で販売される予定でした。<br/><br/>しかし、センスが無いということと、メロンは「しん」を取って食べるということから、「あんしんですメロン」の「しん」を取り、「あんですメロン」となったそうです。
