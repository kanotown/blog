<strong><em>HikiNEET</em></strong><br/><br/>Yesterday, I introduced the term <strong><em>hikikomori</em></strong> (引きこもり), which means people who withdraw into their homes or rooms and rarely go outside.<br/><br/>In addition to being a <em>hikikomori</em>, if the one is also a "NEET," these terms can be combined as <strong><em>hikiNEET</em></strong> (ヒキニート).<br/><br/>NEET is an acronym for "Not in Education, Employment, or Training" and refers to people who are neither students nor employed and are not receiving vocational training.<br/><br/><em>Hikikomori</em> and <em>NEET</em> are sometimes confused because of their lack of independence, but their definitions are distinctly different.

ヒキニート<br/><br/>昨日は、自宅や自室に引きこもり、そこからほとんど出ない人を意味する「引きこもり」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>「引きこもり」に加えて、「ニート」でもある場合、これらを組み合わせて「ヒキニート」と表現されることがあります。<br/><br/>ニートとは、"Not in Education, Employment, or Training" の略で、学生でも社会人でもなく、職業訓練も受けていない人のことを指します。<br/><br/>「引きこもり」と「ニート」は自立していない点で共通しているため混同されることがありますが、定義は明確に異なります。
