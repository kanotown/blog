# 【No. 2047】The Meaning of Dog: Part 1
<div class="date">May 30, 2023 21:17</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The Meaning of Dog: Part 1<br/><br/>In my post yesterday, I used the phrase <strong><em>kaisha no inu</em></strong> (会社の犬).<br/><br/>The literal meaning of <em>kaisha no inu</em> is "corporate dog," but it actually means "corporate slave."<br/><br/>This is derived from the fact that Japanese people have an image of dogs as "obedient to their owners."<br/><br/>The Japanese word <strong><em>inu</em></strong> (犬 - meaning "dog") can also be used in another sense, such as "spy."<br/><br/>This is derived from the image of (police) dogs snooping around someone and reporting the results to their owners.<br/><br/>To be continued in part 2.

犬の意味 Part 1<br/><br/>昨日の投稿の中で、「会社の犬」という言葉が登場しました。<br/><br/>「会社の犬」の文字どおりの意味は "company's dog" ですが、実際には "corporate slave" の意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>これは、日本で「犬」という動物は「飼い主に従順」というイメージが強いことに由来します。<br/><br/>日本語の「犬」はその他にも、「スパイ」のような意味で使われることがあります。<br/><br/>これは、他人の秘密などを嗅ぎ回って飼い主に報告するイメージに由来します<br/><br/>続く
