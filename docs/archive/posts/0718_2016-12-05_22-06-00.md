<div class="date" hidden>Dec 5, 2016 22:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese term "on no ji".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "the character 'on' (御)", and it describes that something is much appreciated or  very satisfying.<br/><br/>The character "御" (on) is one of the highest grade honorific words which is attached to the head of a noun.<br/><br/>Therefore, when you want to attach "御" to something, it is quite impressive and terrific.<br/><br/>However, this term is often used to wrongly mean something like that it's not satisfying but enough.<br/><br/>According to the public opinion survey in Japan, 51.4% use the term wrongly, and 38.5% use it correctly.

御の字<br/><br/>今日は「御の字」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「御の字」は「大変ありがたい」や「望みが叶ってとても満足がいく」ということを表します。<br/><br/>「御」という字は優れたものの頭に付く最上級の尊敬語であり、「御」の字を付けたくなるほどのものは、とても素晴らしくありがたいということです。<br/><br/>しかし、この言葉は「一応納得はできる」という間違った意味で使われることが多いようです。<br/><br/>世論調査では、51.4％が間違った意味で使っており、正しい意味で使っている人は38.5％でした。
