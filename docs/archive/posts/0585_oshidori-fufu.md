# 【No. 0585】<strong><em>Oshidori Fufu</em></strong> (A Happily Married Couple)
<div class="date">Jul 25, 2016 11:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "oshidori fufu," which means "a happily married couple."<br/><br/>In the past, it was thought that once oshidori (mandarin ducks) pair up, they spend their lifetimes while snuggling each other.<br/><br/>This is the etymology of oshidori fufu.<br/><br/>However, actually a male of oshidori leaves behind a female after she laid eggs, and the male makes a new couple year after year.<br/><br/>It is said that a truly ideal couple is made by cranes.<br/><br/>Once cranes pair up, they will remain a husband and a wife until death in most cases.<br/><br/>Also, if either of them passes away, even if it becomes only bones, the crane will continue to guard the dead body.

おしどり夫婦<br/><br/>今日は、仲の良い夫婦を意味する「おしどり夫婦」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>かつて、おしどりの夫婦は一度つがいになったら、いつも寄り添い、一生一緒に過ごすと考えられていました。<br/><br/>これがおしどり夫婦という言葉の由来です。<br/><br/>しかし実際は、メスが卵を産むと、オスはメスのもとから去っていき、毎年のように、新しい相手とつがいになります。<br/><br/>本当に理想的な夫婦は、鶴だと言われています。<br/><br/>鶴は一度つがいになると、相手が死ぬまで夫婦であり続けることが多いです。<br/><br/>また、相手が死んでも、死んで骨になっても、その死体を守り続けるそうです。

 Wow! Cranes are certainly faithful and loyal, perhaps more so than human beings! ^^
