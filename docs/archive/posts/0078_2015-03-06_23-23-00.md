<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　Today, I created a web page that summarizes my previous posts. Actually, I had created a similar web page, but it was inconvenient because I used accordion representation. The accordion representation means that posts are folded and it would be open when we click the post title. This movement was rather cool, but I couldn't read my post unless I click it. I wanted to search corrected posts using some keywords, and to do this, there's a need all post are opened. So I created new one which is simple, light and open. Now I can search my posts effectively. Hehehe I'm so tired to create this. In the near future, I will re-create the css file and re-design this page.<br/><br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/lang8/" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/lang8/</a>

You're welcome. But I would like to ask, do you mind if I correct your entries? I am fluent and my stepgrandfather is an american...

No, not at all! I'm really glad if you correct my entries (my poor English). :D

<p class="correction_comment">"That" and "which" have a very subtle difference in usage -- not even native English speakers can fully grasp the difference all the time. Really broadly (and this is not always the case): if you are referring to a specific instance, you are better off using "that." Consider the following examples of correct usage:<br/><br/>A. My website uses the "X" design principle, which is simple, light, and open.<br/>B. My website uses a design principle that is simple, light, and open.<br/><br/>This is a really small point, but if you can grasp it, you'll be better than a majority of native speakers!</p>

 This is actually super, super useful! What language did you write this in? Do you have the source uploaded somewhere?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One feature that I've thought would be really useful for lang-8 is the ability to "hide" crossed-out corrections so that only the correct sentence is left over. If this is in a language I know, maybe I can help you implement it. I don't know any scripting languages, though, so if it's not, like, Python or Java...

Thank you so much for your helpful correction!<br/>I had learned only like " 'which' and 'that' as relative pronouns are almost same," but today I learned the difference between them from you! :D<br/><br/>&gt; What language did you write this in? Do you have the source uploaded somewhere?<br/>Actually I used Java, html/css, and PHP.<br/>Firstly, I extracted target sentences and comments using Java program I wrote. Secondly, I outputted decorated html data using also Java. Thirdly, I aggregated and showed each html data using PHP. <br/><br/>&gt; One feature that I've thought would be really useful for lang-8 is the ability to "hide" crossed-out corrections so that only the correct sentence is left over.<br/>Oh, it seems really useful and suitable for reviewing past posts. I'd like to implement it. :)<br/><br/>&gt; If this is in a language I know, maybe I can help you implement it. I don't know any scripting languages, though, so if it's not, like, Python or Java...<br/>I'm sorry for my poor English, I couldn't understand this sentence well. Is this means you know other compiler languages like C or Java? In fact, Java is a compiler language while JavaScript is a scripting language.

<p class="correction_comment">It's not all that important that CSS be capitalized, but it's good to be consistent with capitalizing acronyms.  In any case, people who know about web design will understand what you mean.</p>

Thank you so much for your correction!<br/>Indeed, "CSS" is easier to understand.<br/><br/>&gt; I'm looking forward to seeing your future work on this.<br/>Hehe, I hope you'll enjoy. :D
