<h1 id="subject_show">Seisaku and Seisaku</h1>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the difference between confusing Japanese words, "製作 (seisaku)" and "制作 (seisaku.)" <br/><br/>The readings of them are the same, and the meanings are similar, but the nuances are a little different.<br/><br/>"製作" is mainly used when you create something that is tangible, such as practical products.<br/><br/>For example: "大量のパソコンを製作する。" (I create/manufacture a lot of computers.)<br/><br/>"制作" is mainly used when you create an art work, such as a movie or a painting.<br/><br/>For example: "新しいパズルゲームを制作する。" (I create/produce a new puzzle game.)<br/><br/>Since there are many cases that can use both of them, you don't need to be sensitive too much.

製作と制作<br/><br/>今日は、紛らわしい日本語「製作」と「制作」の違いを紹介します。<br/><br/>両者は読み方が全く同じで、意味合いも似ていますが、ニュアンスが若干異なります。<br/><br/>「製作」は主に実用的な製品など、形あるものを作るときに用いられます。<br/>（例：大量のパソコンを製作する。）<br/><br/>「制作」は主に映像や絵画など、芸術作品を作るときに用いられます。<br/>（例：新しいパズルゲームを制作する。）<br/><br/>交換可能なケースも多く存在するので、神経質になる必要はありません。

 Interesting! As far as I know the verb 作る also has three or four different writings.

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>Yes, "つくる" has four different writings: "作る," "創る," "造る," and "つくる."<br/>I'd like to write about them someday on Lang-8 :)
