<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Gotaku wo Naraberu</em></strong><br/><br/>To say something selfish continuously or to harp on the same string is described as <strong><em>gotaku wo naraberu</em></strong> (御託を並べる) in Japanese.<br/><br/><strong><em>Gotaku</em></strong> (御託) is short for <strong><em>gotakusen</em></strong> (御託宣) -- <strong><em>go</em></strong> (御) is a polite prefix and <strong><em>takusen</em></strong> (託宣) means "divine revelation."<br/><br/>In addition, <strong><em>naraberu</em></strong> (並べる) usually means "to arrange something," but here it implies that "to say something continuously."<br/><br/>Therefore, the literal meaning of <em>gotaku wo naraberu</em> is "to say divine revelations continuously."<br/><br/>Originally, <em>gotaku/gotakusen</em> didn't have a bad meaning, but <em>gotaku wo naraberu</em> came to have its current meaning because of people who said something selfish/tedious as divine revelations.

御託を並べる<br/><br/>自分勝手なことをくどくど言うことを、日本語で「御託を並べる」と言います。<br/><br/>「御託」は「御託宣」を省略した語であり、「御」は丁寧の接頭辞、「託宣」は神のお告げを意味します。<br/><br/>また、「並べる」は "to arrange something" を意味しますが、ここでは "to say something continuously" （何かを言い続けること）を表しています。<br/><br/>したがって、「御託を並べる」の文字どおりの意味は "to say divine revelations continuously" となります。<br/><br/>もともと「御託」は悪い意味ではなかったようですが、神のお告げとして自分勝手なことを偉そうに話すものもいたためか、「御託を並べる」は現在の意味を持つようになりました。

<p class="correction_comment">Your original version wasn't bad. I just tried to make it a little more natural. I wanted to erase 'tedious' because it makes the reading less comfortable, but I decided to leave it in for the sake of conveying the full meaning.</p>

The Lang-8 system made my last edit hard to read. Here is what it says:<br/><br/>Originally, 'gotaku/gotakusen' didn't have a negative connotation, but that changed due to people who spoke selfish/tedious words as divine revelations.<br/><br/>In my effort to make it natural, I changed a bit much on you, but I hope it helps.<br/>
