アイスクリーム頭痛<br/><br/>私は今、頭がとても痛いです。<br/><br/>頭痛にはさまざまな種類があり、その内の一つに「アイスクリーム頭痛」というものがあります。<br/><br/>これは、アイスクリームなどの冷たいものを食べた直後に数分程度発生する頭痛のことを表します。<br/><br/>アイスクリーム頭痛に関するさまざまな研究が行われていますが、すぐに収まる頭痛であるため、発症メカニズムの解明などは進んでいないそうです。<br/><br/>原因に関する有力な説として、次の二つがあります。<br/><br/>一つは、口腔内の温度が急激に低下することで、反射的に体温を上昇させるために頭に通じる血管が膨張するというものです。<br/><br/>もう一つは、喉の三叉神経が冷たい物で刺激され、このときに発生する伝達信号を脳が関節痛と勘違いするというものです。
