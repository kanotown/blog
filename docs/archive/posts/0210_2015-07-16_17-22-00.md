<h1 id="subject_show">Bought a 3D Printer</h1>
<div class="date">Jul 16, 2015 17:22</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, a super discount sale was held on Amazon.<br/><br/>My target was a MacBook Pro, and it was sold at 50% off in limited 100 units.<br/><br/>However, I couldn't buy it.<br/><br/>Instead, somehow I could buy a 3D printer called "Da Vinci Jr." at 90% off.<br/><br/>While the catalog price was 49,800 yen, the discount price was 4,980 yen.<br/><br/>I was thrilled, but after a while, I thought.<br/><br/>"I wonder if I wanted this?"<br/><br/>Tentatively, I will try to use a 3D CAD software, and create some objects by the 3D printer.

 Haha, great discounts are hard to resist! I was tempted to get a new Kindle during the sale but I stopped myself. My old one is still working (4 years and counting!) And speaking of 3D printers, it reminds me of this

 project.

Thank you so much for your corrections and comments!<br/>You use things for a long time, it's nice! Actually, I bought a kindle paperwhite two months ago, but new one is now sold. So I'm slightly sad, haha.<br/>Oh, I didn't know the project about 3D printers. It looks like so wonderful! Thank you for letting me know it. :D

Yes, it's got sentimental value now. Haha<br/>The Paperwhite is awesome-looking enough. :D
