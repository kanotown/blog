洋画が日本に輸入されるとき、タイトルが全く異なることがあります。<br/><br/>今日は、タイトルの意味が全く異なっている映画の中から、日本人からの評価が高いものと低いものを紹介します。<br/><br/>評価が高いもの<br/>・「The Notebook」・・・「きみに読む物語」<br/>・「Sisters Act」・・・「天使にラブ・ソングを･･･」<br/>・「The Legend of 1900」・・・「海の上のピアニスト」<br/><br/>評価が低いもの<br/>・「The Italian Job」・・・「ミニミニ大作戦」<br/>・「Gravity」・・・「ゼロ・グラビティ」<br/>・「Napoleon Dynamite」・・・「バス男」<br/><br/>「ゼロ・グラビティ」は「Gravity」と正反対の意味です。<br/><br/>「バス男」に関しては、当時日本で流行っていた「電車男」を真似ただけで、「バス」はほとんど関係ありません。<br/><br/>ちなみに「Napoleon Dynamite」の邦題は、去年「ナポレオン・ダイナマイト」に変更されました。

 I didn't know about the Japanese title of "Napoleon Dynamite"! That's so interesting!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I noticed that titles change for Disney movies, too. ( "Tangled" to 「塔の上のラプンツェル」and "Frozen" to 「アナと雪の女王」, for example.) I thought it was because the Japanese titles tried to be more clear about the movies' content. But 「天使にラブ・ソングを･･･」isn't any clearer than "Sisters Act," is it? How strange!

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/><br/>&gt; I noticed that titles change for Disney movies, too. ( "Tangled" to 「塔の上のラプンツェル」and "Frozen" to 「アナと雪の女王」, for example.) <br/>Haha, yes. They are completely different, indeed. In particular, many Japanese people will be surprised when they notice that the original titile of "カールじいさんの空飛ぶ家" is "Up."<br/><br/>&gt; I thought it was because the Japanese titles tried to be more clear about the movies' content. But 「天使にラブ・ソングを･･･」isn't any clearer than "Sisters Act," is it? How strange!<br/>Yes, Japanese titles often try to be more clear about the movies' content, but sometimes try to imply the atmosphere. If we translate 'Sisters Act' into Japanese literally, it will imply a kind of gloomy movies. On the other hand, so "天使にラブ・ソングを･･･" implies comical and funny atmosphere that it seem to receive high commendation.
