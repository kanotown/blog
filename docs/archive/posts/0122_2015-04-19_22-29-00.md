ちんぷんかんぷん<br/><br/>今日は、日本語の独特なフレーズを紹介しようと思います。<br/><br/>それは、「全くわからない」を意味する「ちんぷんかんぷん」です。<br/><br/>とても不思議で、かわいらしい響きを持つフレーズです。<br/><br/>もし日本語で全く理解できないことがあったら、「ちんぷんかんぷんです。」と言うといいかもしれません。<br/><br/>しかし、状況によっては皮肉に聞こえる恐れがあるので、気をつけて下さい。

 スペイン語で「全ては中国語であります」という、よく分かりません時に。皮肉は日本語でもありますか？知りませんでした。日本人は皮肉があんまり好きじゃないだと聴きました。

Interesting! 確かに漢字を習っていない人にとって、中国語は難しく思えますね。<br/>日本語にはあまりそのような表現はありませんが、<br/>わけが分からない時に「宇宙人の言葉のようだ」等と言うことがたまにあります。<br/><br/>日本人は皮肉はあまり好きではないと思いますが、ありますよ。<br/>欧米の皮肉とはちょっと違うかもしれませんが。

It's "ちんぷんかんぷん," which means<span class="f_gray">, like,</span> "it's all Greek to me."
<p class="correction_comment">"Like" is a filler word that doesn't really have any meaning. We use it when speaking to make a pause if we need to think, or if we are not sure what to say. There are probably more reasons why people say it at well.<br/><br/>When writing, I like to put it in commas on both sides of it to show that it is only an extra word.

Thank you very much for correcting my post!<br/>You're comments are informative for me! :D

You're welcome!<br/><br/>Also, maybe I should mention that "like" can have a meaning if it is a verb. For example: "I like ice cream."<br/>It can also be used to give instructions: "please open the box like this."<br/>Please do not get confused!

Thank you for your helpful comments!<br/>Maybe it's too late, but I have one question. Can I say <br/>「It's "ちんぷんかんぷん," which means something like "it's all Greek to me."」?<br/>Actually, I thought that if I said "A means B", it would mean "A equals B." However, I wanted to express "A nearly equals B," so I put "like" after "means."
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Oceansea</span><br>
Yes! That sentence is perfect. "Something like" is a good way to say "similar too."<br/><br/>I just heard ちんぷんかんぷん in an anime recently! I laughed. Thanks for teaching me this phrase.
