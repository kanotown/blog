<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The Japanese word "明日," which means "tomorrow," has three different readings, "ashita," "asu," and "myonichi." <br/><br/>In general, Japanese people often use either "ashita" or "asu."<br/><br/>"Ashita" originally meant "朝 (asa)," which means "morning," and used as an antonym of "夕べ (yube)," which means "evening."<br/><br/>Then the meaning came to change to "next morning," "next whole morning," and "next day."<br/><br/>On the other hand, "asu" means "tomorrow" from the beginning, and it seems to come from the abbreviation of "akasu," which means "dawn," or "asa," which means "morning."<br/><br/>Also, "asu" sometimes means "in the near future."<br/><br/>"Myonichi" is the just reading of "明日" in on-yomi (Chinese reading).<br/><br/>The most formal reading is "myonichi," the second place is "asu," and the most casual reading is "ashita."

「あした」と「あす」と「みょうにち」<br/><br/>日本語の「明日」という漢字は、「あした」「あす」「みょうにち」の三通りの読み方があります。<br/><br/>世間一般では、「あした」もしくは「あす」のどちらかが使われることが多いです。<br/><br/>「あした」はもともと「朝（あさ）」を意味し、「夕べ（ゆうべ）」の対語として使われていました。<br/><br/>そして、夕べに対する次の朝、次の午前中、次の日（明日）という意味に変化していったそうです。<br/><br/>一方、「あす」は「明かす（あかす）」の略、または「あさ（朝）」から転じたものと考えられており、昔から「翌日」を意味していました。<br/><br/>「あす」は、「近い将来」を表すこともあります。<br/><br/>「みょうにち」は、「明」と「日」をそのまま音読みしたものになります。<br/><br/>最もフォーマルで文語的なのは「みょうにち」、次いで「あす」、そして最もカジュアルで口語的なのは「あした」です。
