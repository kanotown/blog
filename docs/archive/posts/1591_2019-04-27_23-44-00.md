眼鏡<br/><br/>私は今日「眼鏡」を買いました。<br/><br/>「眼鏡」は "glasses" を意味する日本語であす。<br/><br/>「眼」は "eye" を意味する言葉ですが、「鏡」について正確な語源はわかっていません。<br/><br/>あるサイトでは、「さしがね（物差し）」から来ていると説明し、またあるサイトでは「鏡（かがみ）」から来ていると説明しています。<br/><br/>ちなみに、眼鏡はイタリアで1284年に発明され、1551年にフランシスコ・ザビエルが日本に伝えたとされています。

 眼鏡は眼の鏡（かがみ）でしょう？もともとglassesはeyeglasses, つまり eye (め）と (looking)-glass つまり、mirrorってことです。面白いですね?
