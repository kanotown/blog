<div class="date">Mar 4, 2017 09:15</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese term "bibiru."<br/><br/>"Bibiru" means to be scared or feel intimidated.<br/><br/>We often regard this word as a slang term that is used by young people, but actually this word has been used since the Heian period.<br/><br/>Originally, "bibiru" was "bibiru oto" (bibiru sound), and it referred to chattering sounds arising from armors when numerous army moved.<br/>(The onomatopoeia of the sound was "binbin.")<br/><br/>Also, it is said that an army ran away by considering sounds of birds flying off at once as enemy's "bibiru sound."<br/><br/>From this story, "bibiru" became to be used to mean to be scared.

びびる<br/><br/>今日は「びびる」という表現を紹介します。<br/><br/>「びびる」は、怖がったりおじけづくことを意味します。<br/><br/>最近の若者がよく使うスラングのイメージがありますが、この言葉は平安時代から使われていました。<br/><br/>元々、大軍が動く時に鎧が触れ合って「びんびん」と響く音のことを「びびる音」と呼んでいました。<br/><br/>ある軍は、小鳥がいっせいに飛び立つ音を敵軍の「びびる音」と勘違いし、逃げ出したと言われています。<br/><br/>このことから、「びびる」は「おじけづく」という意味で使われるようになりました。

 How can I say scaredy-cat? ビビりくん？
</p>

I think that "ビビリくん" is a coined workd (maybe it was used in NARUTO), but it's easy for us to understand that it means a scaredy-cat.<br/><br/>Also, you can say "腰抜け (koshinuke),"  "腰抜け野郎 (koshinuke yaro)," or "hetare."
