黒歴史 Part 2<br/><br/>もともと「黒歴史」は、アニメ「∀ガンダム」において「太古に封印された戦争の歴史」を表す用語であり、そこから「なかったことにしたい過去」の意味を持つスラングとして広まりました。<br/><br/>中学生時代の黒歴史を持つ人が多いのではないかと思います。<br/><br/>実際、昨日の投稿で触れた私の黒歴史は、私が中学2年生頃のときに作られたものです。<br/><br/>思春期である中学2年生頃には、背伸びした言動や、自己陶酔した言動をとりやすくなると言われています。<br/><br/>このことから、そのような状態になっている人のことを、「中二病」と呼ぶことがあります。
