# 【No. 0652】<strong><em>Hana ga Takai</strong></em> (Long Nose)
<div class="date">Sep 30, 2016 02:04</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese idiom "hana ga takai," whose literal meaning is "long nose".<br/><br/>Of course, this idiom has meaning that someone's nose is physically long, but has also meaning of "proud" or "boastful".<br/><br/>For example, it's used as "musuko ga tenis no taikai de yusyo shite hana ga takai" (my nose is long because my son won the tennis tournament).<br/><br/>It is said that this idiom comes from a long-nosed goblin called Tengu.<br/><br/>The Tengu is a mythical creature in Japan, and is also called "symbol of pride."<br/><br/>If you say "Tengu ni naru" (to be Tengu), it will express "to be proud."<br/><br/>"Hana ga takai" and "Tengu ni naru" have the same etymology, but note that the former doesn't have bad nuances, while the latter expresses bad impressions.

鼻が高い<br/><br/>今日は、「鼻が高い」という慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>もちろん、身体の特徴として鼻が高いという意味を持ちますが、それに加えて「誇らしい」「得意げな」といった意味も持ちます。<br/><br/>例えば、「息子がテニスの大会で優勝して鼻が高い」のように使います。<br/><br/>この慣用句の語源は、天狗の鼻が高いことから来ているとされています。<br/><br/>日本の伝説上の生き物である天狗は高慢の権化とも言われ、「高慢になる」ことを意味する「天狗になる」という慣用句もあります。<br/><br/>語源は同じですが、「天狗になる」は悪い意味合いを含む一方で、「鼻が高い」は悪い印象をあまり持ちません。
