# 【No. 0910】<strong><em>Jaja Uma</em></strong> (じゃじゃ馬 - Shrew)
<div class="date">Jun 15, 2017 03:50</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In yesterday's post, I introduced the word "otenba," which means a spirited girl.<br/><br/>Actually, there is the similar term, which is called "jaja uma" (じゃじゃ馬).<br/><br/>"Jaja" is an onomatopoeia that represents something noisy/spoiled, "uma" means a horse, and jaja uma originally refers to a restive horse that doesn't get used to people.<br/><br/>This came to be metaphorically used to humans, especially women.<br/><br/>Both otenba and jaja uma refer to a spirited girl, but in the strict sense, jaja uma refers to an wayward woman who are hard to deal with.<br/><br/>I think that this is really idle information, but I prefer to both otenba and jaja uma.

じゃじゃ馬<br/><br/>昨日の投稿で、活発な女の子を意味する「おてんば」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>実は、よく似た言葉に「じゃじゃ馬」というものがあります。<br/><br/>「じゃじゃ」は騒がしい様、わがままを言う様を表した擬音語であり、本来じゃじゃ馬は人に慣れない暴れ馬を意味する言葉です。<br/><br/>これが比喩的に人間、特に女性に対して使われるようになったというわけです。<br/><br/>おてんばもじゃじゃ馬も活発な女性を指す点では同じですが、じゃじゃ馬は（まさに本来の意味のじゃじゃ馬のように）言うことを聞かない扱いの難しい女性を指します。<br/><br/>どうでも良い情報ですが、私はおてんばな子もじゃじゃ馬な子も好きです。

"Jaja" is an onomatopoeia that represents something noisy/spoiled, "uma" means a horse, and jaja uma originally refers to a restive horse that doesn't get used to people.

I think that this is really idle information, but I like both otenba and jaja uma.
<p class="correction_comment">"Useless knowledge" sounds more natural than "idle information," "Prefer to" doesn't make sense here, I think "like" is what you meant. You could also say "I am partial to both" if you mean that you like the women the words represent.</p>

I forgot to change the color of the word "children" to blue.

Thank you so much for correcting my post, 南蛮人-san!<br/>And thank you for trying to translate from my Japanese text! (^^)<br/>I wrote "～な子," but here it means "girl/woman" rather than "child," so the former (girls/women) might be more appropriate :)

you wrote "This came to be metaphorically used to humans, especially women".<br/><br/>If "じゃじゃ馬な子" means jajauma girl<br/><br/>How would one write in japanese:<br/><br/>jajauma boy<br/><br/>jajauma child<br/><br/>?<br/><br/>
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
Oh, sorry I forgot to reply this comment.<br/><br/>If you want to say something like jajauma boy/child, I think that you can use "やんちゃ" instead of "じゃじゃ馬." For example, やんちゃな男の子 (yancha boy).
