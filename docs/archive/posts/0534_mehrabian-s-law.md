メラビアンの法則<br/><br/>今日は、メラビアンの法則について学びました。<br/><br/>メラビアンはアメリカの心理学者であり、コミュニケーションに関する実験を行ったことで有名です。<br/><br/>彼は矛盾したメッセージが発せられたとき、その人の態度や行動が聞き手にどのような影響を及ぼすかを実験しました。<br/><br/>例えば、笑いながら怒ったり、浮かない顔で励ましたりする実験です。<br/><br/>その結果、影響の度合いは言語情報が7％、聴覚情報が38％、視覚情報が55％であることがわかり、この法則は「7-38-55のルール」とも呼ばれます。<br/><br/>しかし日本ではこの法則が誇張され、「話の内容よりも、容姿・表情・話し方が重要」と解釈されることが多いです。<br/><br/>この原因は、「人は見た目が9割」という本が日本でベストセラーになったからだと思います。
