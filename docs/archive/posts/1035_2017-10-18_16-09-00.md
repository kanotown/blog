# 【No. 1035】The Definition of Vegetable Part 2
<div class="date">Oct 18, 2017 16:09</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In some countries, there are several definitions about the classification of vegetable and fruit like the following.<br/><br/>・It's a fruit when it has seeds, whereas it's a vegetable when it has no seeds, but there're some exceptions. <br/><br/>・When processing to a paste, a fruit will become jam, whereas a vegetable will become sauce.<br/>(According to this definition, if tomato is a fruit, it will become tomato jam instead of tomato sauce.)<br/><br/>Incidentally, in the past in the US, 10 percents tariffs was applied to vegetables, and fruits were excluded.<br/><br/>Because of this, a trading merchant tried to import tomatoes as fruit, but in 1893, the US Supreme Court decided that tomato is a vegetable because it don't dessert.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the debate about the classification of vegetable and fruit has continued, and there seems to be no definitive criteria for it yet.

野菜の定義 Part 2<br/><br/>他の国の野菜と果物の区別の仕方には、例えば以下のようなものがありました。<br/><br/>・種があるものは果物、ないものは野菜、ただし例外もある<br/><br/>・ペースト加工するとジャムになるのが果物、ソースになるのが野菜<br/>（この定義によると、もしトマトが果物だったら、トマトソースはトマトジャムになります。）<br/><br/>ちなみに、かつてアメリカでは野菜に10％輸入関税がかけられており、果物は除外品となっていました。<br/><br/>このことに注目し、貿易商はトマトを果物として輸入しようとしましたが、1893年のアメリカ最高裁では「トマトはデザートにならないから野菜」と判決を下しています。<br/><br/>残念ながら、トマトが野菜か果物かの議論は現在でも繰り広げられているようで、決定的な分類の基準は未だに存在しないようです。
