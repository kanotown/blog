デカイヘビ<br/><br/>今日はインターネット上で面白い動物を見つけたので、紹介します。<br/><br/>それは「ストレリア・デカイ」という蛇で、日本は「デカイヘビ」とも呼ばれます。<br/><br/>デカイヘビは北米地域に広く分布しており、生息数は安定していて、絶滅の心配は全くされていません。<br/><br/>「ストレリア」はアメリカの医師であり博物学者である「David Humphreys Storer」から、「デカイ」はアメリカの動物学者「James Ellsworth De Kay」から来ています。<br/><br/>この名前の何が面白いかと言うと、「デカイ」は日本語で「大きい」のカジュアルな表現であるということです。<br/><br/>「デカイヘビ」と聞くとほとんどの日本人は「大きい蛇」を想像しますが、実際にこの蛇はとても小さいので、きっと戸惑います。

 Interesting! Speaking of snakes... It seems that 6 poisonous snakes were confiscated from an apartment in Edogawa-ku in Tokyo few days ago.
