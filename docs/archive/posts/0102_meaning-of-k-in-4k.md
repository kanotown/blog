# 【No. 0102】Meaning of "K" in "4K"
<div class="date">Mar 30, 2015 18:55</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
We recently came to use the word "4K" or "8K" as an resolution indicator.<br/><br/>If we use the word "4K," it probably means the resolution of 3820x2160, and this is comparable to four times the Full HD resolution(1980x1080).<br/><br/>Therefore I thought "4" of "4K" means "4 times."<br/><br/>However, the meaning of "K" was "kilo."<br/><br/>That is, "4K" represents that the width of the resolution is around 4000 pixels.

「4K」の「K」の意味<br/><br/>私たちは最近、解像度を表す指標として「4K」や「8K」などを使うようになってきました。<br/><br/>「4K」と言えば通常、3820x2160 の解像度を表しており、これはフルHD（1980x1080）の4倍の解像度となります。<br/><br/>そのため、私は「4K」の「4」は、4倍という意味だと思っていました。<br/><br/>しかし、「K」の意味を調べると、それは「キロ」でした。<br/><br/>すなわち、「4K」は横の解像度が約4000だということことを表しています。
