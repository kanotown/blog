# <strong><em>E ni Kaita Mochi</strong></em> (A Rice Cake Drawn in a Picture)
<div class="date">Dec 29, 2016 11:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday I wrote about "mochitsuki" (rice cake pounding).<br/><br/>Today I will talk about the proverb "e ni kaita mochi", which includes the word "mochi".<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "e ni kaita mochi" is "a rice cake drawn in a picture", and it means that something is totally useless or there is no possibility to realize something, even if it looks/sounds good.<br/><br/>This proverb comes from the fact that even if you can draw mochi (rice cake) in a picture very well, you can't eat it, and it is not useful.<br/><br/>The etymology is the Chinese word "gabei", ("ga" means "picture" and "bei" means "mochi") which can be found in Sangokushi.

絵に描いた餅<br/><br/>昨日は「餅つき」について書きました。<br/><br/>今日はそれにちなんで、「絵に描いた餅」ということわざを紹介します。<br/><br/>「絵に描いた餅」は、（見栄えや聞こえが良くても）何の役にも立たないことや、実現する可能性がないことを表します。<br/><br/>このことわざは、餅を上手に描けても食べることはできず、役に立たないことに由来します。<br/><br/>語源は、三国志に出てくる中国語の「画餅」です。
