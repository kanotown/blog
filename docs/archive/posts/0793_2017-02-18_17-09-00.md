# Daifuku
<div class="date">Feb 18, 2017 17:09</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese food "daifuku."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of 大福 (daifuku) is "big lucky", and it is a kind of Japanese sweets that wrap azuki-an (a sweet red paste made from red azuki beans) in mochi (sticky rice cake).<br/><br/>During the Muromachi Period, such mochi sweets were called "uzura mochi" (quail mochi) because of its shape.<br/><br/>Also, since uzura mochi was big and gave you the feeling of long fullness, it was also called "腹太餅 (harabuto mochi)," where '腹 (hara)' means <em>belly</em> and '太 (buto)' means 'large').<br/><br/>During the Edo Period, harabuto mochi became smaller, and it became to be called "大福餅 (daifuku mochi)," where '大 (dai)' means <em>big</em> and '腹 (fuku)' means <em>belly</em>.<br/><br/>Finally, the auspicious letter '福 (fuku),' meaning <em>lucky,</em> came to be used instead of '腹,' and it became '大福 (daifuku)' or "大福餅 (daifuku mochi)."

大福<br/><br/>今日は「大福」という日本の食べ物を紹介します。<br/><br/>大福は、小豆でできた餡を餅で包んだ和菓子の一種で、大福餅とも呼ばれます。<br/><br/>室町時代には、このような餅菓子は、その形から「鶉餅」と呼ばれていました。<br/><br/>また、当時の鶉餅は大きく、腹持ちが良かったことから（そして鶉のお腹は膨れていたことから）、「腹太餅（はらぶともち）」とも呼ばれていました。<br/><br/>江戸時代にはもう少し小さくなり、「大腹餅（だいふくもち）」という名前が一般的になりました。<br/><br/>そして、「腹」の代わりに縁起の良い「福」という字をあてて、「大福」と呼ぶようになりました。
