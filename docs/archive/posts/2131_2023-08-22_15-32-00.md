# 【No. 2131】Expiration Date for Eggs
<div class="date">Aug 22, 2023 15:32</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Expiration Date for Eggs<br/><br/>What would you do if you found expired eggs in the refrigerator?<br/><br/>In Japan, the typical expiration date for eggs, indicating the period during which they can be eaten raw, is set at about two weeks. However, if properly stored in the refrigerator, they can be eaten raw for about two months.<br/><br/>Interestingly, "Salmonella," contained in eggs and cited as the cause of food poisoning, hardly multiplies at temperatures below 10℃.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it might multiply due to temperature changes and vibration by opening and closing the refrigerator, so caution is needed when storing eggs for long periods.<br/><br/>In addition, Salmonella is known to perish with heat.<br/><br/>Even if the expiration date has exceeded by several months, eggs that have been properly stored in the refrigerator without cracks can still be eaten by heating them.

卵の賞味期限<br/><br/>冷蔵庫に賞味期限の切れた卵があった場合、どうしますか？<br/><br/>日本での一般的な卵の賞味期限は、生で安心して食べられる期間として約2週間が設定されていますが、冷蔵庫で適切に保存すれば約2ヶ月程度は問題ないとされています。<br/><br/>実は、卵に含まれ食中毒の原因として問題視されている「サルモネラ菌」は、10℃以下ではほとんど増殖しません。<br/><br/>しかし、冷蔵庫の開け閉めによる温度変化や振動・ひび割れに起因して増殖する可能性があるので、長期保存には注意が必要です。<br/><br/>また、サルモネラ菌は熱に弱いことでも知られています。<br/><br/>仮に何ヶ月も賞味期限が過ぎていたとしても、冷蔵庫で適切に保管されたひび割れの無い卵であれば、十分に加熱することで食べられます。
