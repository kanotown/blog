カプセルホテル<br/><br/>カプセルホテルに泊まったことはありますか？<br/><br/>日本、特に東京の都市部にはとても多くのカプセルホテルが存在します。<br/><br/>カプセルホテルは宿泊施設であり、利用客は二段に積まれたカプセル状の空間内で就寝します。<br/><br/>通常のホテルに比べると安価なため、節約は可能ですが、騒音や快適性、セキュリティなどの問題があります。<br/><br/>私も出張の際に何度か利用したことがありますが、いびきなどの音がストレスとなり、リラックスして休めませんでした。

 大変そうだね。I don't mind sleeping in a small space, but only if I had privacy and a quiet room.
