<div class="date">Apr 5, 2018 10:59</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Recently, I was surprised to watch news.<br/><br/>Eventually the peak of cedar pollen has passed, but cypress pollen will likely hit its peak soon.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the amount of the cypress pollen this year seems 428 times more than the amount of last year.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this number is in Hachioji city, Tokyo, where I am living.<br/><br/>It is said that the increase in pollen level is due to the rapid temperature rise at the end of March 2018.<br/><br/>I think that the cause of my itchy eyes is this cypress pollen.<br/><br/>It is very hard for me to spend this pollen season.

2018年の花粉<br/><br/>先日、ニュースを見て驚きました。<br/><br/>ようやくスギ花粉のピークが過ぎましたが、次はヒノキ花粉がやってきます。<br/><br/>そしてこのヒノキ花粉、飛散の量が去年の428倍とのことです。<br/><br/>しかもこの数値、私が住んでいる八王子市内のものだそうです。<br/><br/>このようになった理由として、3月末の急激な気温の上昇が考えられます。<br/><br/>最近やたら目がかゆいのは、このヒノキ花粉が原因のようです。<br/><br/>辛いです。
