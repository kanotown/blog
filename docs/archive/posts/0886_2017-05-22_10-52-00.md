にやける<br/><br/>「にやける」は一般的に利用される日本語です。<br/><br/>しかし、数年前に実施された世論調査によると、日本人の77％がこの言葉を間違って使っているそうです。<br/><br/>「にやける」は、「にやけ（若気）」を動詞化したもので、本来は男が女のように色っぽくめかしこんだり、男がなよなよしたりすることを意味します。<br/><br/>しかし、ほとんどの日本人が「にやける」を「薄笑いを浮かべる」という意味だと認識しています。<br/><br/>これは、人が薄笑いを浮かべる顔から聞こえてくる音を表した擬態語「にやにや」から来ているものだと思われます。<br/><br/>これだけ勘違いしている人が多いと、近い将来辞書の意味も変化するかもしれません。

However, according to a poll conducted several years ago, around 77% of Japanese use this verb in the wrong sense.
<p class="correction_comment">For some reason, using "Japanese" to mean "Japanese people" sounds a bit weird. It's understandable, but it can throw the reader off. It's the same case with "Chinese", "Vietnamese", "Portuguese", and pretty much any other nationality that ends in "-ese". For these, the following is probably more common:<br/><br/>"... around 77% of Japanese/Vietnamese/Portuguese people use... "<br/><br/>This is also the case for nationalities ending in "-ish" (Irish, English)<br/><br/>However, this isn't the case for nationalities that end in "-an" (American, German, Russian), "-er" (New Zealander), or "-ean" (Chilean, Korean). For these, we can just use the plural:<br/><br/>"... around 77% of Americans/New Zealanders/Chileans use... "<br/><br/>It's probably because the plural of "-an", "-er", "-ean" is different from the adjective form:<br/><br/>(1) Japanese =&gt; Japanese, but<br/>(2) American =&gt; Americans<br/>etc.<br/><br/>Hopefully that makes sense.</p>

Niyakeru is a term for men, and it means to glam up sexily like women, or to be wishy-washy.
<p class="correction_comment">"to glam up" is okay, but it's pretty uncommon.<br/><br/>More idiomatic would be:<br/><br/>(1) "... and it means to cross-dress as a woman... ", or just<br/>(2) "... and it means to dress up like a sexy woman... "</p>

 I tried to nitpick at the slightest things since your writing is already very good. Hopefully it's helpful.

 Almost perfect English! Keep up the good work :)

 Also, in the third correction, sorry that the word "incorrectly" is separated. I'm on my phone so it puts it in a weird format.
