<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There are several Japanese terms that mean to imitate something, such as "mane," "mohou," or "pakuri."<br/><br/>However, if you can use the term "niban senji" (二番煎じ), it may be a little cool.<br/><br/>"Niban" (二番) means "second" and "senji" (煎じ) means to brew/decoct tea or medicinal herbs.<br/><br/>That is to say, niban senji refers to brew something again that was brewed, and the taste of such tea or medicine will of course become thin.<br/><br/>Based on this fact, niban senji has come to refer to warmed-over things that imitates/repeats existing ones.

二番煎じ<br/><br/>何かを真似するという意味の日本語としては、「真似」や「模倣」、「ぱくり」などがあります。<br/><br/>しかし、もし「二番煎じ」という日本語を使えたなら、少し格好いいかもしれません。<br/><br/>「二番」は "second," 「煎じ」はお茶や薬などを煮て成分を取り出すことを意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち二番煎じは、一度煮出したものを再び煮出すことであり、そのようなお茶や薬は最初に煎じたものよりも味や成分が薄くなります。<br/><br/>このことから、以前にあったものの模倣や繰り返しで新鮮味に欠けるものに対して「二番煎じ」が使われるうようになりました。
