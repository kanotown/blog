ゾロ目<br/><br/>あけましておめでとうございます。<br/><br/>今日は1月1日、そしてこれは1111回目の投稿です。<br/><br/>このように同じ数字が並ぶことを、「ゾロ目」と言います。<br/><br/>「ゾロ目」は、「揃い目」が強調された言葉です。<br/><br/>ここで「目」は、サイコロの目を意味します。<br/><br/>もともと「ゾロ目」は2つのサイコロの目が揃うことを意味していました。<br/><br/>これが転じて現在では、同じ数字が並ぶことも意味するようになったというわけです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、2桁以上のゾロ目の自然数で、累乗数のものは存在しません。

Thank you very much for correcting my post!<br/>According to the Wikipedia, you can see the proof of that in an article, "On the Diophantine equation a(x^n-1)/(x-1)=y^q," written by Yann Bugeaud.<br/><br/>あけましておめでとうございます！

Thanks!  I haven't found the specific paper yet, but it looks like related works contain a lot more math than I learned in college ^^;
