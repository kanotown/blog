<div class="date">Jan 10, 2016 16:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Mario (proper name: Mario Mario) is the most famous game character in the world, which is created by Mr. Miyamoto.<br/><br/>According to Mr. Miyamoto, Mario is around 26 years old.<br/><br/>I had played various Mario games when I was a child, but I exceeded the age of Mario insidiously.<br/><br/>The age of Dr. Mario hasn't been revealed, but it seems to be thought that he is a little more elder, because he is a doctor.<br/><br/>The age of Princess Peach also hasn't been revealed, but her age seems to be similar to Mario's age, because when Mario is a baby in Mario &amp; Ruigi RPG 2, Peach is also a baby.

マリオの年齢<br/><br/>マリオ（本名：マリオ・マリオ）は、宮本氏が生み出した世界で最も有名なゲームキャラクターです。<br/><br/>宮本市によると、マリオの年齢は26歳前後だそうです。<br/><br/>マリオのゲームは子どもの頃によくプレイしていましたが、いつの間にかマリオの年齢を超えていました。<br/><br/>ドクターマリオは医者であるため、もう少し年上であると考えられているようです。<br/><br/>ピーチ姫の年齢も明らかになっていはいませんが、マリオ＆ルイージRPG2でマリオと同じ時代に赤ん坊だったことから、マリオと同じくらいだと考えられます。

 Ahh I see. I never really considered or thought about Mario's age! I like playing Mario though, especially Mario Kart! :3

Thank you so much for correcting my post! <br/>I also like Mario Kart! Maybe it's old, but I had spent a lot of time to play Mario Kart 64.

I think any good game is worth giving it credit, even if it is a super old game! Actually, I want to try an old Mario game someday. I probably won't be able to get it in this day and age though xD

Indeed. In fact, many people have still done speedrun of Super Mario 64 or Super Mario Bros. I think this is a evidence that these games are loved. :)

I heard a lot about Super  Mario Bros but I have yet to try the game. I think I should try it this year! ^^

Thank you very much for correcting my post! <br/>&gt; I've been playing Super Mario 3D World with my wife recently.<br/>That's nice. I watched play videos of Super Mario 3D World several times. Since it looks so fun, I'd like to buy Wii U (or NX) and play the game someday.
