<h1 id="subject_show">Itadaki Dachi (いただき立ち)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Feb 24, 2018 17:01</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I introduced you to the word "oitoma," which is used when you leave a house you're visiting.<br/><br/>Today I'd like to talk about いただき立ち (itadaki dachi), which can be used in a similar situation.<br/><br/>いただき (itadaki) means "to receive," 立ち (tachi) means "to stand," and the combination means to go home (leave the house) soon after givin a meal or drink.<br/><br/>This term is often used in conjunction with "oitoma," just something like いただき立ちで失礼ですが、そろそろおいとまさせて頂きます (itadaki dachi de shitsurei desuga, sorosoro oitoma sasete itadakimasu - I'm sorry for "itadaki dachi," but it's time for me to leave).<br/><br/>"Itadaki dachi" is used when you have to leave a house soon after having a meal, but in such a case, you should say no to the host before serving the meal at least once.

いただき立ち<br/><br/>昨日は、訪問先から帰る時に言う言葉「おいとま」を紹介しました。<br/><br/>今日は似たような状況で使える「いただき立ち」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「いただき」は "to receive"、「立ち」は "to stand" を意味します。<br/><br/>そして「いただき立ち」は、訪問先で飲食をごちそうになった後、すぐに帰ることを意味します。<br/><br/>「おいとま」と組み合わせて「いただき立ちで失礼ですが、そろそろおいとまさせて頂きます」のように言います。<br/><br/>時間がなくてすぐに帰らなければいけないときに使うわけですが、そのような場合は少なくとも一回、食事を遠慮したほうが良いかもしれません。

 Interesting! I've heard that in some countries refusing food when you're a guest can be considered as an insult, and people often go out on an empty stomach just not to complicate things.

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>Your information is really interesting. In some regions in Japan, suggesting a meal implies a feeling that the host wants you to go home.

You're welcome!<br/><br/>&gt;Your information is really interesting. In some regions in Japan, suggesting a meal implies a &gt;feeling that the host wants you to go home.<br/><br/>Oh really. I didn't know that. All I can say that this is a very unique way of sending off unwelcomed guests.
