<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Do you have a friend or a follower to whom you can talk about your any problem or thought?<br/><br/>Trusting someone deeply like this, or just such a man, is called "fukushin" (腹心) in Japan.<br/> <br/>Originally, "fukushin" means literally "stomach and heart" (the "fuku" means "stomach" and the "shin" means "heart"), and it also means "deep inside of one's mind."<br/><br/>Furthermore, it has come to mean that you can trust enough to talk about your heart of hearts, and such trustworthy person.<br/><br/>There are many idioms/terms related to "hara/fuku" (腹 - stomach) in Japan, but most of them are related to "heart/mind."

腹心<br/><br/>あなたには、思っていることや悩みなど、どんなことでも打ち明けて相談できる相手がいますか？<br/><br/>そのように深く信頼できること、もしくはそのような人のことを、日本語では「腹心」と言います。<br/><br/>元々「腹心」は文字通り「腹と胸」を意味し、転じて「心の奥底」も意味します。<br/><br/>さらに、心の奥底を打ち明けるほど信頼できること、信頼できる人を表すようになりました。<br/><br/>「腹」に関する慣用句は多く存在しますが、そのほとんどは「心」に関係しています。
