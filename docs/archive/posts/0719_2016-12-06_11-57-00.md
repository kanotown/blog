# 【No. 0719】<strong><em>Hobo wo Kamu</strong></em> (To Bite a Belly Button)
<div class="date">Dec 6, 2016 11:57</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the idiom "hozo wo kamu."<br/><br/>"Hozo" means "a belly button" ("hozo" is commonly said as "heso" in Japan), "kamu" means "to bite", and "hozo wo kamu" describes to bitterly regret or to cry over split milk.<br/><br/>This idiom comes from the fact that even if you try to bite your belly button, your mouth would never reach it.<br/><br/>It has been confirmed that this idiom had been used in ancient Chinese stories during the Chunqiu period.<br/><br/>By the way, although both "heso" and "hozo" have the same meaning "a belly button" and the same kanji character "臍", "heso wo kamu" is regarded as a wrong usage.

ほぞを噛む<br/><br/>今日は「ほぞを噛む」という慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ほぞ」とは「へそ」のことであり、「ほぞを噛む」はひどく後悔することや、取り返しのつかないことを悔やむことを意味します。<br/><br/>この慣用句は、自分のへそを噛もうとしても口が届かないことに由来します。<br/><br/>春秋時代の中国の故事で使用されていることが確認されています。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「へそ」と「ほぞ」は同じ意味と漢字を持ちますが、「へそを噛む」は誤りとされています。
