# TOEIC Test Day
<div class="date">Jan 11, 2015 21:28</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today was the TOEIC test day, so I was a little nervous.<br/><br/>And I took the TOEIC test.<br/><br/>At first, I went well in the listening section, and the phase problem section as well.<br/><br/>However, I spent many time to solve phase problem section, and I couldn't answer the last 15 problems (I filled the mark sheet randomly).<br/><br/>I want to be able to read English statements more quickly.

Thank you so much for your correction! (^-^)<br/><br/>&gt; Is this under the Reading Section?<br/><br/>Yes! I wanted to mean [phrase problem section] as Part 5 and Part 6 under the Reading section.

 I hate it when that happens!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 &gt;I just filled in the answer sheet randomly.

 Spoken like a true mathematician! （笑）

Thank you for your polite correction! (*'▽')<br/><br/>And now I noticed my mistake. Actually, I wanted to say like "I got bogged down in the single passage section (which is following the grammar section)."<br/><br/>&gt; Spoken like a true mathematician! （笑）<br/><br/>Someday, I wanna be a mathematician! :D
