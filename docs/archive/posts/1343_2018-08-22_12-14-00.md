うらやまけしからん<br/><br/>一昨日は「けしからん」を、昨日は「うらやましい」を紹介しました。<br/><br/>今日はこれら2つの言葉を組み合わせた「うらやまけしからん」という俗語を紹介します。<br/><br/>既に説明したとおり、「けしからん」は道理に外れた物事に対する怒りの気持ちを、「うらやましい」は他人の恵まれた状態に憧れる気持ちを表す言葉です。<br/><br/>そして「うらやまけしからん」は、道理に外れていて本来諌めるべきであっても、本音では憧れの気持ちがあるときに使われます。<br/><br/>この言葉は、性的なシチュエーションや、かわいい動物に対して使われることが多いです。

 There are pretty much no grammatical errors that I can see!

 <br/>
 Reminds me of the English phrase "guilty pleasure" haha. It's something that you openly say you dislike but you enjoy it while no one is present.

Thank you so much for the corrections. :)<br/>And thank you for letting me know the interesting phrase! Indeed I think its nuance is similar to the one of urayamakeshikaran.

<p class="correction_comment">"against for that" is an island of mistakes in a sea of otherwise flawless English. I am not 100% sure what you meant even when I (try to) read the Japanese, but I think you mean that you want the situation despite the fact that you do not want it. Like you want and do not want at the same time. Or maybe you know that you should not want it, but you do anyway.<br/><br/>One construction we might use is "Despite X, Y" meaning "X is true, and Y and X usually do not go together, but this time they do." "Despite being an athlete, his legs are not muscular." That kind of thing.<br/><br/>I made my suggestion above a little more "spicy": "feel repulsed" is how you feel when you strongly dislike something.</p>

Thank you so much for the corrections and suggestion. :)<br/>I didn't know the term "feel repulsed," but it is probably closer to what I wanted to say.
