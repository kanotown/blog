# 【No. 1307】<strong><em>Kahō wa Nete Mate</strong></em> (果報は寝て待て - Everything Comes to Those who Wait)
<div class="date">Jul 17, 2018 20:33</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kahō wa Nete Mate</strong></em><br/><br/>A Japanese TV show conducted an interesting survey related to Japanese proverbs.<br/><br/>The targets are Japanese people over 80 years old, and the question is "What is the proverb that you don't believe?"<br/><br/>The first place proverb was "kahō wa nete mate" (果報は寝て待て).<br/><br/><strong><em>Kahō</em></strong> (果報) means <em>happiness</em> or <em>compensation,</em> <strong><em>nete</em></strong> (寝て) means <em>to sleep,</em> and <strong><em>mate</em></strong> (待て) means 'to wait.'<br/><br/>That is to say, this proverb means that happiness will come if you wait comfortably (after doing what you should do).<br/><br/>Note that it doesn't mean that happiness will come if you are lazy.<br/><br/>The reason why this proverb wasn't believed might be that many Japanese people thought that it would mean the latter.

果報は寝て待て<br/><br/>日本のあるテレビ番組で、ことわざに関する興味深い調査が行われました。<br/><br/>それは、80歳以上の方々に、嘘だと思うことわざは何かを尋ねるというものです。<br/><br/>一位は、「果報は寝て待て」でした。<br/><br/>「果報」は 'happiness' や 'compensation,' 「寝て」は 'to sleep,' そして「待て」は 'to wait' を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわちこのことわざは、「（すべきことをした後は、）焦らず待っていればいずれ幸福が訪れる」ということを意味します。<br/><br/>「寝たり怠けたりしていれば幸福がやってくる」という意味ではないので注意して下さい。<br/><br/>多くの日本人が後者の意味だと勘違いしているため、「嘘」だと思われてしまったのかもしれません。

 面白いです。質問があります。どうして「待って」ではなく、「待て」なのですか？

Thank you so much for the correction. :)<br/>「待って」は、「懇願」の意味を含む、カジュアルな表現です (Please wait...)。<br/>「待て」は、命令形です (Wait...)。<br/>ことわざなどでは基本的に、カジュアルな表現は使われません。
