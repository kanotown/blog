 Interesting! I wonder, what the effect will be if you'll eat instant soba instead of toshikoshi one? ^_^

Thank you very much always for correcting my post! <br/>I think both of them have the same effect (the effect of instant one might be weaker, though). To make soba is a little difficult, while to make instant soba is really easy. So lazy people can't make soba except instant one. :)
