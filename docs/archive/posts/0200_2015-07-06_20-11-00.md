<h1 id="subject_show">200th Post</h1>

I reached 200th post!<br/><br/>Somehow I have continued to post every day.<br/><br/>I get bored easily on various things, so I want to send a bouquet to myself, haha.<br/><br/>By the way, now the ratio of the number of posts to the number of corrections is almost one to two.<br/><br/>From now on also, I want to keep this ratio.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I ate ramen and fried chickens and curry at dinner.
