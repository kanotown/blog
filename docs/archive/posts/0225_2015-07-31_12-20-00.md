Thank you for your comment! :)<br/>We always sing this song in English version! I think most Japanese people don't know the existence of Japanese version, haha.

<div class="name"><span class="just_name">シャル❇️</span><br>
hehe I see ^^ Well, if there was a Japanese version, I'd like you to let me know ~
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
The title of Japanese version is "お誕生日のうた," and the lyrics are:<br/>うれしいな　きょうは<br/>たのしいな　きょうは<br/>たんじょうび　おめでとう<br/>おうたを　うたいましょう
