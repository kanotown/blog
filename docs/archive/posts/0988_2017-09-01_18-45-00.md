# Conference Presentation
<div class="date">Sep 1, 2017 18:45</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I presented my study in an academic conference for the first time in six months.<br/><br/>The material for presentation was completed about one hour before my presentation.<br/><br/>Since I couldn't finish it until just before my session, I have never could practice my presentation.<br/><br/>I was very nervous, but I could speak better than I thought, it doesn't terrible too much.<br/><br/>However, in the question and answer session, I became a little panicked, said some weird things.<br/><br/>I was very embarrassed and felt miserable.<br/><br/>I'd like to devote myself further to studying so that I can answer more smartly.

学会発表<br/><br/>今日、私は6ヶ月ぶりに学会発表しました。<br/><br/>資料が完成したのは、発表の約1時間前です。<br/><br/>かなり直前までかかってしまったので、発表練習は一回もできませんでした。<br/><br/>とても緊張しましたが、発表は思ったよりもうまくいきました。<br/><br/>しかし、質疑応答でかなり慌ててしまい、変なことを口走ってしまいました。<br/><br/>とても恥ずかしく、情けなかったです。<br/><br/>もっとスマートに返答できるように、勉学に邁進していきたいです。

Thank you for the corrections and your comment!<br/>Yes, it's related to computed tomography, and I think that it was interesting.
