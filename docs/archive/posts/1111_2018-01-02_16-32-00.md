<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
On January 2nd in various places of Japan, a traditional event called 書き初め (kakizome) is held.<br/><br/>The 書き (kaki) means "to write," the 初め (some/zome) means "beginning," and this term means "art of writing using a brush and ink for the first time in the New Year."<br/><br/>Originally, kakizome was a ritual held at the imperial court, but it has spread among common people since the Edo period.<br/><br/>Also, to begin something on January 2nd is called 事始め (kotohajime - beggining things), and it's believed that it's easy to improve what you begin on that day.<br/><br/>That is to say, kakizome is conducted to improve your calligraphy skill.

書き初め<br/><br/>日本では1月2日、「書き初め」と呼ばれる伝統行事が各地で行われます。<br/><br/>「書き」は "to write," 「初め」は "beginning" を意味し、「書き初め」は「年が明けて初めて毛筆で書く書のこと」を表します。<br/><br/>もともと書き初めは宮中で行われていた儀式でしたが、江戸時代以降は庶民にも広まりました。<br/><br/>また、1月2日に何かを始めることを「事始め」と良い、この日に始めたことは上達しやすいと言い伝えられてきました。<br/><br/>すなわち、書き初めには「書道が上達するように」という願いが込められているというわけです。
