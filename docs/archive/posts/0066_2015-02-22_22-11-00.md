<h1 id="subject_show">How to Use 'Almost' and 'Most'</h1>
<div class="date">Feb 22, 2015 22:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　I'm sometimes confused by how to use ’almost’ and <em>most</em>. So today, I'd like to make a note about correct examples and wrong examples.<br/><br/>Correct examples:<br/>・almost all scientists...<br/>・almost all of the scientists...<br/>・most scientists...<br/>・most of the scientist...<br/>・(the) scientists mostly...<br/><br/> Wrong examples:<br/>・almost all of scientists...<br/>・almost scientists...<br/>・most of scientists...<br/>・most the scientist...<br/><br/>I really often make a such mistake. If I say "Almost people are...," this might imply an alien which is becoming a human. I'd like to be careful.<br/>
