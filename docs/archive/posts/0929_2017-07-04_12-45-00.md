# 【No. 0929】Finished Watching Friends
<div class="date">Jul 4, 2017 12:45</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I finally finished watching the TV drama, Friends, from season one to ten.<br/><br/>Since all characters has grown nicely through the ten years, I feel nostalgic when I think back on the first season.<br/><br/>I watched all episodes with Japanese subtitles, but from now on, I will watch them again from the first episode with English subtitles.<br/><br/>Incidentally, one episode of this drama is about 22 minutes, and there were totally 238 episodes, so it means that I watched them for a total of about 87 hours.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is said that you need about 500 hours listening if you want to an acquire English ability that is enough to travel abroad.<br/><br/>The milestone will be attained if I watch all episodes six times, but it looks like a tough road.

フレンズ<br/><br/>今日、とうとうドラマ「フレンズ」のシーズン1から10まで、全て見終わりました。<br/><br/>登場人物が10年という月日で全員素敵に成長していて、振り返るとしんみりした気持ちになります。<br/><br/>これまでは日本語字幕で見ていましたが、もう一度最初から、今度は英語字幕で見てみようと思います。<br/><br/>ちなみに1話が約22分で、合計238話あったため、合計約87時間見ていたことになります。<br/><br/>一方、海外旅行で困らないレベルの英語力を身につけるには、500時間のリスニングが必要と言われています。<br/><br/><br/>フレンズを前シーズン6周見れば達成できる計算ですが、先は長そうです。
