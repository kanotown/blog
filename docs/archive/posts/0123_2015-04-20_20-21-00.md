# The meaning of "適当（てきとう : tekitou）"
<div class="date">Apr 20, 2015 20:21</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Japanese people often use the word "適当(tekitou)."<br/><br/>However, this word has very confusing two different meanings.<br/><br/>That is,  "appropriate(proper)," and "irresponsible(dishonest)."<br/><br/>Despite the completely different meanings, we represent it in one word.<br/><br/>The meaning will be determined by the atmosphere of the field, however, I think we use the word as the meaning of "irresponsible" in many cases.<br/><br/>If you want to represent the meaning of "appropriate" safely, using the word "適切(tekisetsu)" is better.

「適当」の意味<br/><br/>日本人はよく「適当」という言葉を使います。<br/><br/>しかしこの言葉は、とても紛らわしい2つの意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>すなわち、「ぴったり当てはまる」「いい加減」です。<br/><br/>全く違う意味なのに、一つの単語で表すのです。<br/><br/>意味は、その場の雰囲気などで決まりますが、「いい加減」の意味でつかわれることが多いように感じます。<br/><br/>「ぴったり当てはまる」の意味を確実に表したい場合は、「適切」という言葉を使ったほうが良いかもしれません。

Thank you so much for your helpful corrections!<br/>Ah, I had forgotten that we sometimes used the word "ムード(mood)" in Japanese. I also think this word is more appropriate. :)

The meaning will be determined by the atmosphere of the field (or: <span class="f_blue">by context</span>), however, I think we use the (or: <span class="f_blue">this</span>) word as the meaning of "irresponsible" in many cases.
