# 【No. 1013】<strong><em>Wagamama</strong></em> (わがまま - Selfish Character)
<div class="date">Sep 26, 2017 21:14</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I don't like a person who has a personality called "wagamama" (わがまま) very much.<br/><br/>"Wagamama" means that someone is selfish or acts spoiled.<br/><br/>Where the "waga" (わが) means "myself," and the "mama" (まま) means "as someone pleases."<br/><br/>Therefore, the literal meaning of "wagamama" is that you act just as you please without thinking other people -- that is, it implies a selfish character.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the character "mama" (ママ) can means just "mama" in English.<br/><br/>Because of this, you can make a pun something like "waga mama wa wagamama da" (わがママはわがままだ), which means "Me mother has a selfish character."<br/>(This is my original pun.)

わがまま<br/><br/>私は「わがまま」な性格の人が少し苦手です。<br/><br/>「わがまま」とは、自分自身の都合だけを考えて行動するさまを表す言葉です。<br/><br/>ここで、「わが」は「自分の」、「まま」は「思い通り」を意味します。<br/><br/>つまり「わがまま」とは文字どおり、他人のことを考えず自分の思い通りになるようにする、身勝手な性格という意味です。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「まま」という文字は「お母さん」を意味することもできます。<br/><br/>このことから、「我がママはわがままです」のようなダジャレを作ることができます。<br/>（私のオリジナルのダジャレです。）

 This is very interesting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There is a chain of restaurants called Wagamama in the UK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Very good work.

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>I didn't know the restaurants called Wagamama. On the website, I could find a lot of Japanese terms. It was very interesting, thank you for letting me know that :)

You're welcome. The food in Wagamama restaurants isn't as good as in Japan, of course.
