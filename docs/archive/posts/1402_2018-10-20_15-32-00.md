<div class="date">Oct 20, 2018 15:32</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Tama ni Kizu</strong></em><br/><br/>Is there a perfect person or thing around you?<br/><br/>I think that most people and things have shortcomings, even if they look perfect.<br/><br/>If you want to describe a person or thing that looks perfect but has a slight shortcoming like this, you can use the proverb <strong><em>tama ni kizu</em></strong> (玉に瑕).<br/><br/><strong><em>Tama</em></strong> (玉) means "jewelry" and <strong><em>kizu</em></strong> (瑕) means "scratch" or "fault."<br/><br/>This proverb was born in China, and originally it literally meant "a slight scratch/scar on a beautiful jewelry," but these days it often used to mean "a person who looks perfect but has a small fault."

玉に瑕<br/><br/>あなたの周りには、完璧な人や、完全なものがありますか？<br/><br/>ほとんどの人やものは、たとえ完璧や完全に見えたとしても、何らかの欠点があると思います。<br/><br/>このように、完全に見えるものに僅かな欠点があることを表すことわざに「玉に瑕」があります。<br/><br/>「玉」は「宝石」を、「瑕」は「ものにできたきず」や「欠点」を表します。<br/><br/>このことわざは中国で生まれ、もともとは文字通り「美しい宝石についた小さなきず」を表していましたが、現在では「完全のように見えるが小さな欠点のある人」の意味で使われることが多いです。

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/><br/>&gt; Btw could you tell me the difference between the kanji 傷 and 瑕?<br/>Actually, 傷 is more common as kanji for 'kizu' (きず) than 瑕 in most cases. 瑕 can mean scratches on a thing, whereas 傷 can mean both scratches on a thing and would on a person.
