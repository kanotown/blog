大丈夫 Part 2<br/><br/>以前私は "it's okay" や "no problem" の意味でよく使われる「大丈夫」という日本語を紹介しました。<br/><br/>今日は、この言葉の語源を説明します。<br/><br/>「大」は "big," 「丈」は成人男性の身長を基準とした長さの単位、「夫」は "man" を意味します。<br/><br/>かつて中国では成人男性を「丈夫」と言い、特に一人前の男のことを「大丈夫」と言いました。<br/><br/>この言葉が日本に伝わり、立派な男の意味から「強い」「安心できる」「問題無い」などの意味に派生しました。<br/><br/>ちなみに、1 丈 は当時の中国では約 1.8 m でしたが、今では 約 3 m となっています。

But now I'm curious. Why did 1丈 change to 3 meters?!

After this term was brought to Japan, the definition gradually became extended to mean; "it's strong," "it's okay," and "no problem."
<p class="correction_comment">I changed to gradually - as I imagine it took some time for the meaning to change over time?</p>
