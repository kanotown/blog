# 【No. 1174】<strong><em>Shinogi wo Kezuru</em></strong> (しのぎを削る - Going Head-to-Head)
<div class="date">Mar 6, 2018 10:23</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
When you engage in fierce competition, we describe it as しのぎを削る (shinogi wo kezuru) in Japanese.<br/><br/>しのぎ (shinogi) means a ridge between 刃 (ha - edge) and 峰 (mine - blunt edge) of a Japanese sword, and 削る (kezuru) means to scrape something.<br/><br/>Therefore, the literal meaning of "shinogi wo kezuru" is to scrape a ridge of a sword.<br/><br/>In a normal sword fight, "shinogi" (ridge) of a sword would not be scraped, so scraping "shinogi" implies that it is a very fierce fight.<br/><br/>Originally, this term was used for a sword fight, but it has come to be used for various fierce fight or competition.

しのぎを削る<br/><br/>両者が互いに力を出し、激しく争うことを、日本語で「しのぎを削る」と言います。<br/><br/>「しのぎ」は、刀の刃と峰の中間部分の、少し盛り上がっているところを指します。<br/><br/>この部分が削り取られるということは、よほど激しく刀をぶつけて切り合っているということです。<br/><br/>もともとは刀を使った争いに対して使われた言葉でしたが、後に意味が広がり、さまざまな激しい争いに対しても使われるようになりました。<br/><br/>

 Hello....After looking at the Japanese, I just thought I would try to improve that one sentence and try to make it a little more accurate.....I would appreciate your comments as to whether you think I am accurate or not. Nice Japanese expression by the way.

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>I think that your sentence is exactly what I wanted to say. However, I don't know whether or not "narrowly miss" is appropriate as a translation of 削る (kezuru). The meaning of "kezuru" is explained in the following URL:<br/><a href="http://www.romajidesu.com/dictionary/meaning-of-" target="_blank">http://www.romajidesu.com/dictionary/meaning-of-</a>%E5%89%8A%E3%82%8B.html<br/>Among them, I thought that "to scrape off" is suitable in my essay.
