# 【No. 0728】"Narau" and "Manabu" (To Learn)
<div class="date">Dec 15, 2016 23:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
When I read sentences written by people who learn Japanese on Lang-8, I found that "narau" is often confused with "manabu".<br/><br/>You can say just "I learn Japanese" to mean both "nihongo wo narau" and "nihongo wo manabu", but there is a determinate difference between these Japanese sentences.<br/><br/>In most cases, "narau" means to be taught something by someone.<br/><br/>On the other hand, "manabu" means to remember or study something by oneself.<br/><br/>Therefore, it's unnatural to use "narau" when teaching yourself something, and you should use "manabu" in such a case.<br/><br/>By the way, it is said that "manabu" is derived from "manebu", which means "to imitate".

「習う」と「学ぶ」<br/><br/>Lang-8で日本語を学んでいる人の文章を読んでいると、「習う」と「学ぶ」が混同されていることがあります。<br/><br/>「日本語を習う」と「日本語を学ぶ」はどちらも "I learn Japanese" と表現できますが、日本語では決定的な違いがあります。<br/><br/>「習う」はほとんどの場合、誰かから何かを教わることを意味します。<br/><br/>一方で「学ぶ」は、自分で何かを覚えたり勉強することを意味することが多いです。<br/><br/>そのため、独学で勉強する場合に「習う」という表現を使うのは不自然で、そのような場合は「学ぶ」を使うべきです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「学ぶ」は「真似（ぶ）」に由来すると考えられています。

 I knew narau meant to be taught by someone but I didn't know manabu.
