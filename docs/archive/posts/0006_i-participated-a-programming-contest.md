# 【No. 0006】I Participated A Programming Contest.
<div class="date">Dec 24, 2014 23:16</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
This year, I have nothing to do with Xmas.<br/><br/>I went to school, researched, worked, came back to home and participated a programming contest.<br/>And misery as well, I was crushing defeat in the contest.<br/><br/>The first problem of the contest demanded the result of A+B.<br/>It looks like really simple and easy, however, it was forbidden to use addition/subtraction operator, and we could use multiplication/division operator and "if" sentence only (comparison operators are not included).<br/>Furthermore, the code was limited to 1000 lines and the number of available variables was limited to 26. <br/><br/>I tried to solve this problem, and about 4 hour later, the contest finished while the problem is not solved.<br/>(Accordingly, just one participant could solve it completely.)<br/><br/>Finally, the answer will be published, but I don't see it and keep trying to solve it by myself for a while.<br/>Because I want to taste the sense of accomplishment and bliss.<br/><br/>Hehehe!

今年、私はクリスマスとは無縁でした。<br/><br/>学校へ行き、仕事と研究をし、家に帰り、そしてプログラミングコンテストに参加しました。<br/>そして悲しいことに、そのコンテストで惨敗しました。<br/><br/>コンテストの1問目は、A+Bの結果を要求するものでした。<br/>これはとても単純で簡単に見えますが、加算/減算の演算子の使用は禁止されており、乗算/除算の演算子と"if"文のみの使用可能でした（比較演算子は含まれません）。<br/>更に、コードは最大1000行で、利用可能な変数は26個でした。<br/><br/>私はこの問題を解くことに挑戦しましたが、4時間後、解けないままコンテストは終了してしまいました。<br/>（結果的に、この問題を完答できたのは1人だけでした。）<br/><br/>最終的には、解答が公開されるでしょうが、私は暫くの間はそれを見ず、自分の力で解くことを試みてみようと思います。<br/>なぜならば、達成感と至福な時間を味わいたいからです。<br/><br/>へへへ。
