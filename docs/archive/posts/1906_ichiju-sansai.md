<strong><em>Ichijū Sansai</em></strong><br/><br/>Do you have a well-balanced diet?<br/><br/>In Japan, <strong><em>ichijū sansai</em></strong> (一汁三菜) is often adopted as a menu for daily meals.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>ichi</em></strong> (一) means "one," <strong><em>jū</em></strong> (汁) means "soup," <strong><em>san</em></strong> (三) means "three," and <strong><em>sai</em></strong> (菜) means "dish," the literal meaning of <em>ichijū sansai</em> is "one soup and three dishes."<br/><br/>In most cases, <em>ichijū</em> means "miso soup," and <em>sansai</em> consists of one main dish such as meat or fish, and two side dishes such as vegetables, mushrooms, or seaweed.<br/><br/>If you add rice as a staple food to <em>ichijū sansai</em>, it becomes a traditional Japanese meal.

一汁三菜<br/><br/>皆さん、バランスの良い食事はとれているでしょうか。<br/><br/>日本では、日常の食事の献立として、よく「一汁三菜」が用いられます。<br/><br/>「一」は "one"、「汁」は "soup"、「三」は "three"、「菜」は "dish" を意味するので、「一汁三菜」の文字どおりの意味は "one soup and three dishes" となります。<br/><br/>「一汁」は味噌汁を表し、「三菜」は、肉や魚などの「主菜」が1つと、野菜やきのこ、海藻などの「副菜」が2つで構成されることが多いです。<br/><br/>「一汁三菜」に、主食のご飯を加えると、日本の伝統的な献立となります。

 Nice!   would ramen/udon be considered as part of traditional meal or only rice ?

Thank you for reading my post!<br/><br/>&gt; Nice! would ramen/udon be considered as part of traditional meal or only rice ?<br/><br/>Udon/soba (noodles made from buckwheat) is a traditional Japanese meal, but the staple food for 一汁三菜 is rice in almost all cases. Also, ramen is based on Chinese noodles, so it is vague whether it can be called a traditional Japanese meal.
