# <strong><em>Manybar Goatfish</strong></em> (Ojisan)
<div class="date">Jun 4, 2015 11:23</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Manybar goatfish is called "ojisan (means man in midlife)" in Japan.<br/><br/>The reason why is that the fish have long barbel on their face and look like men in midlife.<br/><br/>However, I think this naming way is too easy.<br/><br/>We can eat this fish, but if we say "I ate ojisan (I ate man in midlif)," it could sound so strange.

Manybar Goatfish は、和名では「オジサン」と呼ばれています。<br/><br/>この理由は、顔の全面に髭があり、まるで人間のおじさんのようであるためです。<br/><br/>ただ、この名づけ方は安易すぎるようにも思います。<br/><br/>この魚は食べることができますが、「オジサンを食べた」なんて言うと、変な風に聞こえかねません。
