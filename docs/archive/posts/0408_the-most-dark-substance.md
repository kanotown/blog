# 【No. 0408】The Most Dark Substance
<div class="date">Jan 30, 2016 17:46</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The most dark substance is "vantablack," which is composed of carbon nanotubes.<br/><br/>Vantablack absorbs 99.965% of a light, and convert them into heat internally.<br/><br/>Due to such a property, we can not determine whether or not there are unevenness of things that are coated with vantablack.<br/><br/>For example, if someone wear a cloth that is made of vantablack, it looks as if the face and hands appear from the dark space.<br/><br/>Currently, this substance has attracted in the field of weapon and space industries.

最も黒い物質<br/><br/>最も黒い物質は、カーボンナノチューブで構成されるベンタブラックです。<br/><br/>ベンタブラックは光の99.965％を吸収して内部で熱に変換します。<br/><br/>このような性質から、ベンタブラックでコーティングされたものは、凹凸を判別することができません。<br/><br/>例えばベンダブラックで作られた服を着た場合、真っ暗な空間から顔や手が出てきているかのように見えるそうです。<br/><br/>現在、兵器産業や宇宙産業から注目を集めています。

<p class="comment_small">
 I have heard of Vantablack!
 <br/>
 I think that it is very expensive to make. I think it will take some time before it is actually used in weapon and space industry.
 <br/>
 People would have to consider the ethical problems of the use of such material in the weapon industry.
 <br/>
 I've read that, due to its characteristics, Vantablack is hard for the human eye to comprehend.
 <br/>
 Weapons coated in this sort of material could be used for insurgency or something similar!

Thank you very much for the corrections and your comment! :)<br/>Yes, I also think that the cost to make is very expensive and it's difficult to mass-produce, though its concrete figures and the manufacturing process are not disclosed.<br/>Also, as you say, some ethical problems may remain especially in the weapon industry.<br/>I hope this technology will be used for the pure scientific development.

 Interesting! I imagine that vantablack would also have applications in photography studios, where ambient light reflection is important.

Thank you very much for the corrections and your comments!<br/>Indeed, vantablack would available in such a situation. I think we can also think many other uses :)
