# 【No. 0853】<strong><em>Ugai</em></strong> (Gargle)
<div class="date">Apr 19, 2017 09:00</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese word "ugai."<br/><br/>"Ugai" means an act of rinse/gargle your mouth or throat with water to clean it up.<br/><br/>This word comes from a famous ayu (sweetfish) fishing called "ukai" in Gifu prefecture, the literal meaning of which is "to tame a cormorant."<br/><br/>This is because in the ukai, fishermen have cormorants swallow ayu in the water, then have them spit it out on the boat.<br/><br/>In Japan, people have done "ugai" since the Heian era, but it is said that doing "unagi" as preventing cold is an unique Japanese custom.<br/><br/>Actually, it has been skeptical for a long time whether or not "ugai" has an effect to prevent cold.<br/><br/>However, recently the effectiveness has been proved scientifically.

うがい<br/><br/>今日は「うがい」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「うがい」とは、口や喉を綺麗にするために、水などを含んですすぐことを意味します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、岐阜県の鮎漁で有名な「鵜飼（うかい）」から来ています。<br/><br/>鵜飼では、鵜に魚を水中で飲み込ませ、引き上げて吐き出させるためです。<br/><br/>日本では平安時代からうがいがされてきましたが、風邪予防としてのうがいは、日本独自の習慣だそうです。<br/><br/>長い間、うがいか風邪の予防となるかは懐疑的でしたが、近年効果があるということが明らかにされました。
