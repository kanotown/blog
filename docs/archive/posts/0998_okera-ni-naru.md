おけらになる<br/><br/>私は最近、研究で使う高価な物品を幾つか立替払いで購入しました。<br/><br/>このため、悲しいことにおけらになりかけています。<br/><br/>「おけらになる」とは、所持金が完全に無くなることを意味します。<br/><br/>「おけら」は昆虫の「ケラ」の俗称で、「になる」は "become" を意味します。<br/><br/>「ケラ」を正面から見ると、両手を上げているように見えます。<br/><br/>そして、日本では両手を上げることを「お手上げ」と言い、どうしようも無いことや、行き詰まっていることを表します。<br/><br/>このことから、「おけらになる」は「お金が無くてお手上げ状態になる」ということを意味するようになりました。

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/><br/>&gt; Between Google's translation and this sentence I don't understand what you're expressing.<br/>Here I changed the expression ways between English and Japanese.<br/>I wanted to say something like the following:<br/>"Okera" (オケラ), the official name of which is "kera" (けら), means "Gryllotalpa orientalis," and "ninaru" (になる) means "to become something."
