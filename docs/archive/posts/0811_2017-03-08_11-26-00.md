けちょんけちょん<br/><br/>今日は「けちょんけちょん」という表現を紹介します。<br/><br/>「けちょんけちょん」とは、誰かを徹底的に痛めつけたり、やりこめるさまを表します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、「非常に」を意味する和歌山県の方言「けちょに」に由来すると言われています。<br/><br/>「けちょに」は「けち」に由来するとも、平安時代の源氏物語の言葉に由来するとも考えられていますが、詳しい語源はわかっていません。<br/><br/>これが日本全国に広がる際に、「けちょんけちょん」になったとされています。<br/><br/>「けちょんけちょん」は少し暴力的な表現ですが、その響きは可愛いと思います。

Thank you so much always for correcting my posy! :)<br/><br/>&gt; This is an awkward transition. Is the dialect called "kechoni" or is the word "kechoni"?<br/>Oh, I got something wrong. "Kechoni" is a word.<br/>Actually, the Japanese word "hogen," which is often translated into "dialect" in English, means not only "dialect" but also "a (distinctive) word in the dialect."

No problem!<br/><br/>Oh, I see now.  It makes more sense now.
