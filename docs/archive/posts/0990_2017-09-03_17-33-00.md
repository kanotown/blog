# 【No. 0990】<strong><em>Hitohada Nugu</strong></em> (一肌脱ぐ - Giving Someone A Helping Hand)
<div class="date">Sep 3, 2017 17:33</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Have you ever give assistance to someone in earnest?<br/><br/>Such an act is called "hitohada nugu" (一肌脱ぐ) in Japanese.<br/><br/>The "hito" (一) means "one," "hada" (肌) means "skin," and "nugu" (脱ぐ) means "to take off clothes/something."<br/><br/>In the past, Japanese people wear kimonos that have wide sleeves.<br/><br/>Also, when they did something in earnest, they took off one the kimono from one side of the shoulder, in order not to be disturbed by the sleeve of the kimono.<br/><br/>Because of this fact, "hitohada nugu" has come to be used the current meaning.

一肌脱ぐ<br/><br/>誰かのために、本気になって力を貸したことはありますか？<br/><br/>そのような行為のことを、日本語で「一肌脱ぐ」と言います。<br/><br/>「一」は "one," 「肌」は "skin," 「脱ぐ」は "to take off clothes" を意味します。<br/><br/>かつて日本人は、本気を出すときは着物の袖が邪魔にならないよう、片方の肩にかかった着物を脱いで、上半身の一方の肌を出していました。<br/><br/>このことから、「一肌脱ぐ」は、現在のような意味で使われるようになりました。
