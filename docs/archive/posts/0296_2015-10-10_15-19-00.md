# 【No. 0296】Men Like Right Side
<div class="date">Oct 10, 2015 15:19</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Men (especially right-handed men) tend to choose the right side when they stand with women, because of the feeling "I want to protect her."<br/><br/>Also, many of men aren't cautious in right sides of their bodies, and they seem easy to accept the opponents who told to them from their right sides.<br/><br/>In Italy, an experiment that women asked men for one cigarette was conducted.<br/><br/>As a result, men who were told from their right sides accepted the requests twice as often as men who were told from their left sides.

男は右が好き<br/><br/>男性（特に右利き）は「相手を守りたい」という思いから、女性と並ぶときに右側を選ぶ傾向にあるようです。<br/><br/>そして、男性は体の右側の警戒心が低く、右側から話しかけると相手を受け入れやすいようです。<br/><br/>イタリアで、女性が男性に「タバコを一本くれませんか」と頼む実験が行われました。<br/><br/>その結果、右側から話しかけたほうが、左側から話しかけるより、2倍も要求に応えてくれたそうです。

<p class="correction_comment">The use of "opponents" seems a bit too specific here, since the example you give later isn't a threatening situation.  So, I changed it to the more general "those".  I wasn't sure what else to use for 「相手」, since that can be translated many ways.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">I know it's a less literal translation, but using "asked" is not only more consistent with the previous sentence but also a little softer than "told" which I think is more appropriate here.</p>

 Interesting.  When I'm with my wife, I usually stand on the left side, but we've always done it that way because I'm left-handed and she's right-handed.  Maybe it's also because I have a subconscious feeling of wanting to protect her.  :)

Yes, according to the source, left-handed men tend to like left sides. Also, I think the configuration (a left-handed person stands the left side and a right handed person stands the right side) is very functional!

opponents?

Thank you very much for your corrections!<br/>&gt; opponents?<br/>Since I wanted to say "相手," so I chose the wrod "opponent" from my dictionary. However, I think other words something like "people" was more appropriate.<br/><br/>&gt; Hm, I'll have to try this ;)<br/>Good luck and bless you!
