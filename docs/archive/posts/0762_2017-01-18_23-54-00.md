# Noroma
<div class="date">Jan 18, 2017 23:54</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese word "noroma".<br/><br/>"Noroma" means a dull person or something dull.<br/><br/>It is said that this word comes from "Noroma ningyo" (Noroma doll) in "Ai Kyogen" (comic interludes), which was performed by a puppeteer called Noromatsu Kanbe.<br/><br/>The Noroma ningyo was a dubious doll that has a flat and pale face, and moves slowly.<br/><br/>The noun "noroma" was made from this fact, and a adjective "noroi" (dull) was also made. <br/><br/>By the way, "noroi" can be regarded as a noun, and in such a case, it means "curse".<br/><br/>"A dull curse" can be translated to into Japanese as "noroi noroi".

のろま<br/><br/>今日は「のろま」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「のろま」は、動作や頭の働きがにぶいことや、そのような人を指す言葉です。<br/><br/>この言葉は、江戸の人形遣いである野呂松官兵衛が演じた「間狂言」の「野呂間人形」の由来すると言われています。<br/><br/>この「野呂間人形」は、平らで青白い顔をし、愚鈍な仕草をする怪しげな人形だったそうです。<br/><br/>ここから「のろま」という名詞ができ、更に「のろい」という形容詞ができました。<br/><br/>ちなみに「のろい」は名詞と捉えることもでき、その場合は "curse" を意味します。<br/><br/>"A dull curse" は日本語で「のろいのろい」となります。
