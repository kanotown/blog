日本とクリスマス<br/><br/>今日はクリスマスなので、クリスマスに関するトリビアを紹介します。<br/><br/>日本でのクリスマス（降誕祭のミサ）は、1552年の山口県で初めて行われました。<br/><br/>しかし、その後江戸幕府の禁教令によってキリスト教は禁止され、200年以上もの間クリスマスは一般の間で行われませんでした。<br/><br/>日本でクリスマスが受け入れられたのは、1900年頃にクリスマス商戦が始まったことが大きな契機でした。<br/><br/>また、1926年12月25日の大正天皇制崩御に伴って、この時代12月25日は大正天皇祭として休日となっていたことも、クリスマスが日本の年中行事になったことに深く関わっているようです。<br/><br/>ただし、残念なことにあるアンケートによると、今年のクリスマスは日本人の約半数が一人ぼっちで過ごしているようです。
