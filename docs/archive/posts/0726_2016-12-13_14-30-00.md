# "Mizu" and "Oyu" (Water and Hot Water)
<div class="date">Dec 13, 2016 14:30</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In English, the word "water" is used regardless of the temperature.<br/><br/>However, the literal translation "atsui mizu" ("atsui" means "hot" and "mizu" means "water" in Japan) is a little unnatural.<br/><br/>In Japanese language, nouns that represent water change depending on the temperature.<br/><br/>"Mizu" often translates into "water", but if you say just "mizu", it will represent "cold water".<br/><br/>If you want to represent "hot water" or "boiled water", you have to say "oyu/yu" or "netto".<br/><br/>If you want to represent "chilled water", you have to say "reisui" or "hyosui".<br/><br/>By the way, "lukewarm water" is referred to as "nuruma yu", and if the water was once boiled, it's referred to as "sayu".

水とお湯<br/><br/>英語では、「お湯」と「水」どちらにも "water" という単語を用います。<br/><br/>しかし、"hot water" を直訳した「熱い水」と言う日本語は少し不自然です。<br/><br/>日本語では、水の温度によってその呼び方が変化します。<br/><br/>「水」は "water" と訳されますが、単に「水」と言うとそれは通常 "cold water" を表します。<br/><br/>"Hot water" や "boiled water" を表したい場合は、「お湯」や「熱湯」と言います。<br/><br/>"Chilled water" を表したい場合は、「冷水」や「氷水」などと言います。<br/><br/>ちなみに、ぬるいお湯は「ぬるま湯」、一度沸騰させてぬるくしたお湯は「白湯」と言います。
