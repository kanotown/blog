引っ越しのための大掃除<br/><br/>今日は朝から、来週の引っ越しのため、部屋の大掃除をしました。<br/><br/>掃除の後、着なくなった服や、使わなくなった布団などをまとめて、ゴミ捨て場に持って行きました。<br/><br/>その結果、服や布団などが合計50kgあり、回収料金は1000円でした。<br/><br/>おかげで、部屋の中は大分片付きました。<br/><br/>次は、古くなった冷蔵庫や洗濯機を捨てなければいけません。<br/><br/>まだまだ大掃除は続きます。

After the housecleaning, I went to a garbage pit with my used clothes and futons.
