モグラ<br/><br/>今日はモグラについて話します。<br/><br/>モグラは基本的に、土の中にトンネルをほってそこで生活しています。<br/><br/>土中は光が入ってこないため、モグラの視力は退化しており、ほとんど何も見えていません。<br/><br/>その代わり嗅覚と聴覚がとても発達しており、臭いや音で物体を立体的に把握することができます。<br/><br/>また、モグラは大食漢で、胃の中に12時間以上食物が無いと餓死するそうです。<br/><br/>モグラが穴を掘るスピードはカタツムリ程度だそうなので、毎日大変そうです。

 Sometimes I think animals can't get a sense of whether their lives are 'tough'. They do feel emotions of course, but aside from mating, eating and resting, I doubt that they understand their existence properly.

Thank you very much always for correcting my post!<br/>Hmm, I guess you have a point. Animals might just react to living creature's survival instinct.
