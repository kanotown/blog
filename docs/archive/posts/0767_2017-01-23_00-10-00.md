プラスドライバーとマイナスドライバー<br/><br/>日本には、ねじを締めるドライバーとして、プラスドライバーとマイナスドライバーがあります。<br/><br/>多くの日本人が、「ドライバー」「プラスドライバー」「マイナスドライバー」と言えば、英語圏の人に意味が通じると思っています。<br/><br/>しかし、まず「ドライバー」ではなく「スクリュードライバー」と言わないと伝わりません。<br/><br/>そして、日本人はネジの溝の形から、「プラスドライバー」「マイナスドライバー」と呼んでいますが、これも恐らく伝わりません。<br/><br/>「プラスドライバー」は "Phillips screwdriver" もしくは "Frearson screwdriver" と呼ばれ、「マイナスドライバー」は "slotted screwdriver" もしくは "flat head screwdriver" と呼ばれます。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「マイナスねじ」は汚れの溜まりやすい場所で使われます。
