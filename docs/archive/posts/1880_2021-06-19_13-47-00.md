五月雨<br/><br/>日本は現在、全国的に「梅雨」となっています。<br/><br/>梅雨の時期に続く小雨のことを、「五月雨」といいます。<br/><br/>「さ」は「田の神」を、「みだれ」は「水垂れ」とも書き「雨」を意味します。<br/><br/>五月雨は農夫にとって農作物を育てるのに重要な、まさに天からの恵みの雨というわけです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、さみだれの漢字「五月雨」の文字どおりの意味は "May rain" です。<br/><br/>ここで「五月」は旧暦のことで、現在の新暦でいう6月半ば頃に相当します。

Thank you for the correction! :)<br/>&gt; should it be literally 5th month instead of May ?<br/>You are probably right. I did divide 五月雨 into two nouns: 五月 (translated as May) and 雨, but if you divide 五月 further 五 and 月, its literal meaning would be "5th-month rain."
