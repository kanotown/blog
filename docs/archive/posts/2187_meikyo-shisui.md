# 【No. 2187】<strong><em>Meikyō Shisui</strong></em> (明鏡止水 -  Clear and Serene)
<div class="date">Oct 17, 2023 18:09</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Meikyō Shisui</strong></em><br/><br/>When someone's mind is completely free of distraction and is perfectly clear, the state is sometimes described as <strong><em>meikyō shisui</em></strong> (明鏡止水).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>mei</em></strong> (明) means "clear," and <strong><em>kyō</em></strong> (鏡) means "mirror," <strong><em>meikyō</em></strong> (明鏡) means "a clear and spotless mirror."<br/><br/>In addition, <strong><em>shi</em></strong> (止) means "still," and <strong><em>sui</em></strong> (水) means "water," so <strong><em>shisui</em></strong> (止水) means "water that is still."<br/><br/>Both <em>meikyo</em> and <em>shisui</em> can reflect the shape and form of things as they are, which is why the idiom <em>meikyō shisui</em> has come to be used as a metaphor for a "clear mind."

明鏡止水<br/><br/>一切の邪念がなく、澄み切った状態の心のことを、「明鏡止水」と表現することがあります。<br/><br/>「明」は "clear"、「鏡」は "mirror" を意味し、「明鏡」で「一点の曇りもない鏡」という意味になります。<br/><br/>また、「止」は "still"、「水」は "water" を意味し、「止水」で「流れずに留まっている水」という意味になります。<br/><br/>「明鏡」も「止水」も、ものの姿や形をありのままに写し出すことができるものであり、そこから「清らかな心」の比喩として用いられるようになったというわけです。

 Combined with your lesson on "画竜点睛" the other day, "明鏡止水". reminds me of the game Final Fantasy 7, and certain 必殺技 from that game!

Thank you for the correction!<br/>I see! Such idioms sound really cool as names for skills in games. I haven't played FF7 yet, but I'm thinking of trying it out soon. :)

FF7 is a masterpiece! I played the original in English on PlayStation 1. Some day I want to play the whole game in Japanese.
