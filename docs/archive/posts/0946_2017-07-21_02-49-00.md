<div class="date">Jul 21, 2017 02:49</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A Japanese publishing company named "Sanseidō," which is known for publishing dictionaries, announces "Kotoshi no Shingo" (New Words of the Year) every year.<br/><br/>Today, I learned the new term "emoi" (エモい), which was selected as the second most important word on the Kotoshi no Shingo 2016.<br/><br/>"Emoi" is an adjective that represents something passionate or emotional, and is mainly used by young people and music lovers.<br/><br/>As you would guess, "emoi" comes from the English word "emotion."<br/><br/>"Emoi" was born by shortening "emotion" and adding the suffix, "i," which can change a noun to an adjective.<br/><br/>Incidentally, "emoi" was also used around 2000 by mainly young women, but it was short for "eroi kimoi," which means "dirty and gross."

エモい<br/><br/>日本で辞書や辞典を発行している三省堂という出版社は、その年を代表する新しい日本語を「今年の新語」として毎年発表しています。<br/><br/>私は「今年の新語2016」で第二位に選ばれた「エモい」という言葉を、今日始めて知りました。<br/><br/>「エモい」は、感情に強く訴えるような、情熱的・情緒的なものを表す形容詞で、主に若者や、音楽関係者が使っているようです。<br/><br/>ネイティブの皆さんは想像がついているかもしれませんが、この言葉は英語の "emotion" から来ています。<br/><br/>"Emotion" を省略して、名詞を形容詞化する接尾語「い」を付けることで、「エモい」は生まれました。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「エモい」は2000年頃に若い女性の間で使われており、そのときは「エロくてキモい」を略した言葉だったようです。
