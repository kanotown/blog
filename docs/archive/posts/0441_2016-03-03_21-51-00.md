<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I conducted the accomplishment report of my venture activity at the year-end meeting.<br/><br/>Since this presentation was the compilation of my student life, I was a little nervous, but it went smoothly.<br/><br/>In the social gathering, I presented commemorative gifts to teachers and staffs who supported me, and conveyed to them my sincere appreciation.<br/><br/>When I saw one of them had tearful eyes, I almost cried too.<br/><br/>Also, many of them gave me words of encouragement, so I was impressed.<br/><br/>I'd like to push forward confidently toward my new goal.

年度末成果報告会<br/><br/>今日はベンチャー活動の年度末の成果報告を行いました。<br/><br/>これまでの私の課外活動の集大成なので、少し緊張しましたが、無事終わりました。<br/><br/>そして懇親会では、これまでお世話になった先生や職員の方に、記念品をプレゼントし、感謝の気持ちを伝えました。<br/><br/>中には涙目になって頂いた方もいて、私も泣きそうになりました。<br/><br/>そして、多くの方から激励の言葉をもらい、とても感動しました。<br/><br/>来年度以降も邁進していきたいです。

Also, many of them gave me words of encouragement, so I was impressed.
<p class="correction_comment">Not really a correction but, the word "impressed" here carry's a different nuance. Perhaps, "I was moved" would be better?</p>
