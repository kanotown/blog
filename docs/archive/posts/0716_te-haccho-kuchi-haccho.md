# 【No. 0716】Te Haccho Kuchi Haccho
<div class="date">Dec 3, 2016 12:13</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese idiom "te haccho kuchi haccho."<br/><br/>This idiom describes a person who does something well and has a smart mouth.<br/><br/>"Te" means "hand", "kuchi" means "mouth", and "haccho" means "eight things", so this idiom literally describes a person who can use eight tools by his/her hands or mouth.<br/><br/>Of course, you can use just "te haccho" for a person who does something well, and just "kuchi haccho" for a person who has a smart mouth, respectively.<br/><br/>This idiom originally used as a good meaning to praise someone, but recently, it is often used sarcastically for an insincere person who just looks a good worker or a good talker.

手八丁口八丁<br/><br/>今日は「手八丁口八丁」という慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>「手八丁口八丁」は、「何かをすることも、話すことも達者な人」を表す言葉です。<br/><br/>「手」は "hand"、 「口」は "mouth"、「八丁」は "eight things" を意味し、この慣用句は「手や口で八つの道具を使うことができる」ということが語源になります。<br/><br/>何かをすることが達者な人には「手八丁」、話すことが達者な人には「口八丁」と、それぞれ分けて使うこともできます。<br/><br/>元々は良い意味で誰かを褒める際に使われた言葉ですが、現在では要領の良い人に対して皮肉を込めて使うことが多いです。
