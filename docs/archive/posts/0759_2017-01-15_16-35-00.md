<h1 id="subject_show">National Center Test for University Admissions</h1>
<div class="date">Jan 15, 2017 16:35</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
The National Center Test for University Admissions has been held since yesterday in Japan.<br/><br/>This test is something like a common preliminary exam, which is necessary for entering Japanese national universities.<br/><br/>Lately, the number of private universities that evaluates the results of this test has been increased.<br/><br/>This test has several characteristics -- all problems are tested using computer-scored answer sheets, and IC players are used in the listening exam.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, since the test is held in winter every day, several students can't arrive at the venue due to snow.<br/><br/>I hope that this day will cause a good result for many students.

大学入試センター試験<br/><br/>日本では、昨日から今日にかけて、大学入試センター試験が行われました。<br/><br/>この試験は、日本の国公立大学に入るために必要な、共通一次試験のようなものです。<br/><br/>最近では、私立大学でもこの試験の成績を利用できる大学が増えています。<br/><br/>この試験はマークシート形式であることと、リスニングでICプレイヤーを用いることが特徴です。<br/><br/>残念ながら、冬の季節のため、雪で会場に辿り着けなかった受験生のニュースが毎年報道されます。<br/><br/>多くの人にとって良い結果になることを願います。
