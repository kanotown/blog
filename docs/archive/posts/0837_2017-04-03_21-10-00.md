ししおどし<br/><br/>昨日は害獣を追い払うための「かかし」を紹介しました。<br/><br/>今日は、同じく害獣を追い払うための装置であった「ししおどし」を紹介します。<br/><br/>ししおどしは、水力により自動的に音を発生させる、竹で作られた装置です。<br/><br/>竹筒に水を引き入れ、水が満杯になると重みで竹筒が傾き水がこぼれ空になり、傾きが勢い良く元に戻る際に石などを叩き、音が鳴るというものです。<br/><br/>「しし」は「鹿」のことであり、元々はその名の通り「鹿を脅かす」ための装置でした。<br/><br/>しかし、近年では風流としてその音を楽しむようになり、日本庭園の装飾として設置されることが多いです。
