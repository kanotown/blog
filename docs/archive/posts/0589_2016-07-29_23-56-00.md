忙しい一日<br/><br/>今日は、とても忙しい一日でした。<br/><br/>早朝から大学に行き、合計7時間くらい学生達とディスカッションをし、7時間くらい学会の講演原稿を書いていました。<br/><br/>学生達は来週研究発表があるので、かなり切羽詰まっているようでした。<br/><br/>しかし、私は講演原稿の締め切りが今日だったので、更に切羽詰まっていました。<br/><br/>なんとかぎりぎりで原稿を提出することができて、安心しています。<br/><br/>毎日一回行うと決めたこの英文の投稿も、ぎりぎりになりました。<br/><br/>今日はほんとうに疲れました。<br/><br/>おやすみなさい。
