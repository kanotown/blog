# 【No. 0240】Got Lost
<div class="date">Aug 15, 2015 18:47</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
This morning, I went to cycling to the neighbor mountain on my road bike.<br/><br/>My plan was two hour cycling.<br/><br/>However, somehow I decided to pass through a new route, then I got lost.<br/><br/>Eventually, it took more than five hours to come back my home.<br/><br/>I was really exhausted, but there were also some good things.<br/><br/>Scenery of new route was really beautiful, and I found a lovely lake.<br/><br/>Someday I would like to go there again.
