# 【No. 1407】<strong><em>Harisenbon</strong></em> (ハリセンボン - Porcupinefish)
<div class="date">Oct 25, 2018 14:30</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Harisenbon</strong></em><br/><br/>"Porcupinefish" is referred to as <strong><em>harisenbon</em></strong> (ハリセンボン) in Japanese.<br/><br/>I think that it is easy for most Japanese people to imagine the figure of this fish,<br/><br/>Because <strong><em>hari</em></strong> (ハリ) means "spine" or "needle," <strong><em>senbon</em></strong> (センボン) means "one thousand" or "many," and <em>harisenbon</em> have a lot of spines/needles on their bodies.<br/><br/>Some Japanese people might think that they have around one thousand spines, but the actual number of spines is around 350.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the English name "porcupinefish" is derived from "porcupine," which also have a lot of needles on their bodies.<br/><br/>In addition, "porcupine" comes from the old French "porc-épic," the literal meaning of which is "spiny pig."

ハリセンボン<br/><br/>日本語で「ハリセンボン」と呼ばれる魚がいます。<br/><br/>多くの日本人にとって、この言葉からどんな魚であるかを想像するのは簡単だと思います。<br/><br/>なぜなら、「ハリ」は "spine" や "needle," 「センボン」は "one thousand" や "many" を意味し、「ハリセンボン」は体に多くの棘を有しているからです。<br/><br/>体に約1000本の棘があると勘違いする日本人もいるかもしれませんが、実際の棘の数は約350本前後だそうです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、英名の "porcupinefish" は、多くの棘を持つヤマアラシ ("porcupine") に由来します。<br/><br/>さらに "porcupine" は、「棘だらけの豚」を意味する古フランス語 "porc-épic" から来ているそうです。

 We call them blowfish where I'm from, because they blow themselves up (inflate, not explode).
