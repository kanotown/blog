<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the difference between the Japanese phrases "iro-iro" and "sama-zama."<br/><br/>Both of them have almost the same meaning like "various," and you can replace them in most cases.<br/><br/>"Iro" of "iro-iro" means "color," and "iro-iro" had used for flowers or fabrics as the meaning of "colorful."<br/><br/>However, currently it came to have the meaning of "various."<br/><br/>On the other hand, "sama" of "sama-zama" means something like "state," and "sama-zama" is a more formal expression than "iro-iro."<br/><br/>Also, you can write both of them in Kanji, but to use Hiragana is recommended due to readability.

「いろいろ」と「さまざま」<br/><br/>今日は日本語の「いろいろ」と「さまざま」の違いを紹介します。<br/><br/>どちらも「various」のような意味を持っており、多くの場合入れ替えることができます。<br/><br/>「いろいろ」の「いろ」は「color」を意味しており、以前は花や織物などが色とりどりである様を表していましたが、現在はそれが転じて「various」のような意味になりました。<br/><br/>「さまざま」の「さま」は「state」のような意味であり、「いろいろ」よりもフォーマルな表現です。<br/><br/>また、どちらも漢字で書くことができますが、読みやすさなどの関係上、ひらがなで書くことが推奨されています。

 Your English is fantastic, I didn't see any need to correct anything. I've used いろいろ often and think it's a convenient word, it's cool to learn the history of it!
