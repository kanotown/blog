幕引き<br/><br/>現在参加している学会も、間もなく「幕引き」です。<br/><br/>「幕引き」とは、物事が終りを迎えることを意味する言葉です。<br/><br/>「幕」は "curtain"、「引き」は "to draw" を意味するので、「幕引き」の文字どおりの意味は "to draw a curtain" や "to lower a curtain" となります。<br/><br/>もともとこの言葉は、芝居などで幕を引いて終わらせることや、その役割の人のことを意味していました。<br/><br/>後に、意味が広がり、芝居だけでなくさまざまな物事に対しても使われるようになったというわけです。
