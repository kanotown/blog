# 【No. 1651】<strong><em>Chawan</strong></em> (茶碗 - Bowl/Cup)
<div class="date">Jun 26, 2019 17:24</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Chawan</strong></em><br/><br/>Most Japanese people use <strong><em>chawan</em></strong> (茶碗) every day.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>cha</em></strong> (茶) means "tea" and <strong><em>wan</em></strong> (碗) means "bowl," the literal meaning of <em>chawan</em> is "tea bowl."<br/><br/>In ancient times, <em>chawan</em> literally meant a bowl for putting in and drinking tea, but it gradually came to mean various bowls (especially made of ceramics) for eating and drinking.<br/><br/>In our days, if you say just <em>chawan</em>, it usually refers to a bowl for eating rice.<br/><br/>If you want to mean <em>tea bowl</em> explicitly, you can say <strong><em>yunomi dyawan</em></strong> (湯のみ茶碗) or <strong><em>yunomi</em></strong> (湯のみ); here <strong><em>yu</em></strong> (湯) means "hot water" and <strong><em>nomi</em></strong> (のみ) means "drinking."

茶碗<br/><br/>多くの日本人は毎日「茶碗」を使っています。<br/><br/>「茶」は "tea"、「碗」は "bowl" を意味するので、「茶碗」の文字どおりの意味は "bowl" です。<br/><br/>かつて「茶碗」は文字どおり、茶を飲むための碗を意味していましたが、次第に広く陶磁器製の碗を意味するようになりました。<br/><br/>現代では、単に「茶碗」と言った場合、ご飯をよそうための碗を指すことが多いです。<br/><br/>もし「茶を飲むためのお椀」を明示的に指したい場合は、「湯のみ茶碗」もしくは「湯のみ」と言うことができます。

Thank you for the correction!<br/><br/>&gt; In Japan, are all meals served in "Chawan"?<br/>No, chawan is usually used to put rice, whereas other meals are put on 'sara' (皿 - "dish").
