<div class="date">May 23, 2017 01:04</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
What is the element required for an attractive woman in your country?<br/><br/>In Japan, we tend to regard "okuyukashii (奥ゆかしい)" women as beautiful.<br/><br/>"Okuyukashii" is an adjective word that means that something/someone is modest, elegant, and sensitive to people.<br/><br/>"Oku" means "deep inside" and "yukashii" means "to want to go somewhere," so "okuyukashii" means "to want to go to/see/know deep inside something/someone" -- it expresses the feeling of fascination.<br/><br/>Then okuyukashii has come to have the above meanings, and now it usually means a modest/elegant attitude of a woman.<br/><br/>That is to say, attractive Japanese women for Japanese men are okuyukashii women.

奥ゆかしい<br/><br/>皆さんの国における、魅力的な女性の条件は何でしょうか？<br/><br/>日本では、「奥ゆかしい」女性こそ美人とする風潮があります。<br/><br/>「奥ゆかしい」は、慎み深く上品であることや、控え目で気配りができることを表す形容詞です。<br/><br/>この言葉は、「奥まで行きたい（見たい・知りたい）」ということから、「心惹かれる」という感情を表したものです。<br/><br/>そして、「奥ゆかしい」は次第に上述の意味を持つようになり、現在では特に、女性の上品で慎ましい態度を表すことが多いです。<br/><br/>すなわち、日本人にとって心惹かれる魅力的な女性とは、奥ゆかしい女性ということです。

 Great entry as always. Thank you!

 Here it's difficult to say which quality is the most important to consider a woman beautiful.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On top of that, I find that there is usually a big gap between what people say is important and what actually explains/motivates the way they behave...
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Although not exactly the same thing, have a look at the word "demure".

Thank you very much for correcting my post! (^^)<br/>&gt; Here it's difficult to say which quality is the most important to consider a woman beautiful.<br/>Yes, it's difficult. So I think that I can only say about the tendency.<br/>&gt; Although not exactly the same thing, have a look at the word "demure".<br/>I didn't know the term. I'm not sure but "demure" may imply "oikuyukashii." It's also difficult to convey subtle nuances in another language.
