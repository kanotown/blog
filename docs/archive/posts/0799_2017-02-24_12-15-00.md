<div class="date">Feb 24, 2017 12:15</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese slang "tameguchi."<br/><br/>"Tameguchi" means a way of talking that doesn't contain polite expressions in Japanese conversation.<br/><br/>Originally "tame" was a gambling term that meant repeated digits on dice, and it came to be used to mean "equal basis" or "same age" among young people since around 1960s.<br/><br/>By attaching "kuchi," meaning a way of talking, to the "tame," the slang "tameguchi" was born. <br/><br/>Recently in Japan, the number of young people who can't use polite expressions appropriately is increasing.<br/><br/>Please be careful not to use "tameguchi" to older people and strangers.

タメ口<br/><br/>今日は「タメ口」という日本の俗語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「タメ口」とは、日本語での会話において、敬語を使わない言葉遣いを表します。<br/><br/>「タメ」は元々「ゾロ目」を意味する賭博用語で、1960年代から若者の間で「対等」や「同級生」を意味するようになりました。<br/><br/>この「タメ」に、口ぶりや口調を意味する「口」をつけて、「タメ口」という言葉が生まれました。<br/><br/>最近の日本では、敬語を正しく使えない若者が増えてきています。<br/><br/>目上の人や初対面の人にはタメ口を使わないよう、気を付けましょう。

 "Slang" is a collective noun with usage equivalent to "language".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 You can say:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The teenagers use slang."
 <br/>
 "A dictionary of slang."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Slang" can also be used as an noun modifier, like so:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "a slang term"
 <br/>
 "a slang phrase"
 <br/>
 "a slang expression"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But you can't really say:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "the slang tameguchi"
