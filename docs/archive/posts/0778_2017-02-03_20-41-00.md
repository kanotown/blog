蛇稽古<br/><br/>今日は「蛇稽古」という慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>「蛇稽古」は、稽古事が長続きしないことをたとえて言います。<br/><br/>例：蛇稽古はやめにしよう。<br/><br/>蛇は秋に冬眠をして、春に目覚めて活動を始める生き物です。<br/><br/>この蛇のように、春に稽古事を始めてもまた秋には活動をやめてしまうことを例えて、「蛇稽古」という言葉ができました。<br/><br/>ちなみに、同じような言葉に「三日坊主」があります。<br/><br/>以下の記事にて、その語源の説明をしています。

<p class="correction_comment">I don't know any Japanese, so I had to do some research; didn't want to give bad advice. But it looks like "geiko" is a general term referring to any sort of lesson or practice, and that hebi-geiko refers to quitting anything too soon.</p>
