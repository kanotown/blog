# 【No. 2182】<strong><em>Kizi mo Nakazu wa Utaremai</strong></em> (雉も鳴かずば撃たれまい - Silence Keeps Your Safe)
<div class="date">Oct 12, 2023 18:30</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kizi mo Nakazu wa Utaremai</strong></em><br/><br/>Have you ever faced misfortune because you said something unnecessary?<br/><br/>If you find yourself in such a situation, remember the proverb, <strong><em>kizi mo nakazu wa utaremai</em></strong> (雉も鳴かずば撃たれまい).<br/><br/><strong><em>Kizi</em></strong> (雉) means "pheasant," <strong><em>naka/naku</em></strong> (鳴か/鳴く) means "to cry," <strong><em>zu</em></strong> (ず) is a negative suffix, <strong><em>utare/utareru</em></strong> (撃たれ/撃たれる) means "to be shot," and <strong><em>mai</em></strong> (まい) indicates "naturally" or "appropriately." Therefore, the literal meaning of this proverb is "if a pheasant does not cry, it will naturally not be shot."<br/><br/>In other words, when a pheasant cries, hunters will notice it, leading it to be shot.

雉も鳴かずば撃たれまい<br/><br/>余計なことを言ってしまったばかりに、災難に遭ったことはありますか？<br/><br/>そのよう状況になりそうなときは、「雉も鳴かずば撃たれまい」ということわざを思い出しましょう。<br/><br/>「雉」は "pheasant"、「鳴か/鳴く」は "to cry"、「ず」は否定の接尾辞、「撃たれ/撃たれる」は "to be shot"、「まい」は「当然・適当」を意味する助動詞であるため、このことわざの文字どおりの意味は "if a pheasant does not cry, it will naturally not be shot" となります。<br/><br/>雉が鳴くと、猟師に居場所が知られてしまい、撃たれてしまうということです。

<p class="correction_comment">I've learned that "まい" can also mean "maybe not" or "probably won't" like the phrase "ではあるまい" does the meaning of the auxiliary "まい" change depending on if it is attached to 辞書形 or 連用形?</p>

Thank you for correcting my entry!<br/><br/>The auxiliary verb "mai" has several meanings and changes depending on the context. However, it essentially carries a negative sense.<br/><a href="https://kotobank.jp/word/" target="_blank">https://kotobank.jp/word/</a>%E3%81%BE%E3%81%84-632809<br/><br/>And I'm sorry. I intended to translate the 「①当然 (naturally) ・適当 (appropriately) の意の打消」 from the above site, but I forgot to translate the 「打消」 part, leading to a strange sentence. Therefore, I should have written it as "naturally won't be." Additionally, it might also carry the nuance of "maybe not" as you mentioned.

Thank you for the correction!<br/>I've been corrected on the romanization of "じ" several times, but I made the mistake again. I'm sorry! I'll be more careful.
