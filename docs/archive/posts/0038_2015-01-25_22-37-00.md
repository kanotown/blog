# Rain Bringer
<div class="date">Jan 25, 2015 22:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
   In Japan, there is a word <em>Ameotoko,</em> which means a man whose presence bring on rain in events such as a travel. The word is often used as a joke, but I think it might denigrate someone. In my considered opinion, raining on a trip is not rare case at least in Japan. Actually, the number of precipitation days is 123 days a year in Japan, it's almost one-third probability. There is no wonder that it rains during travels for several times in a row. <br/><br/>   However, if it rains for 15 consecutive times, the probability becomes less than being hit with a thunderbolt probability (or the lottery winning probability). Also, if it rains for 20 consecutive times, the probability becomes as probable as being hit by a meteorite. If there is such a person, he should be respected, I think.<br/>
