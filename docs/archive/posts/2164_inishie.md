# 【No. 2164】<strong><em>Inishie</em></strong> (古 - Obsolete)
<div class="date">Sep 24, 2023 10:15</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Inishie</em></strong><br/><br/>When I use words that were popular several years ago, sometimes young people describe them as <strong><em>inishie</em></strong> (古), which shocks me.<br/><br/><em>Inishie</em> refers to a distant past, and when used to describe other words, it implies that they are "obsolete."<br/><br/>The slang used by today's youth changes rapidly. Therefore, if you use slang terms that were popular just a few years ago, they might be referred to as <strong><em>inishie no kotoba</em></strong> (古の言葉 - "obsolete words"), and you could be treated as an old person.<br/><br/>Although <em>inishie</em> was originally used in formal and written language, it seems increasingly used in casual conversation among young people to emphasize that something is obsolete.<br/><br/>Note that it often carries a connotation of ridicule.

古<br/><br/>私はときどき、何年か前に流行した言葉を使ってしまい、若者に「古（いにしえ）」と形容されてショックを受けることがあります。<br/><br/>「古」は、はるか昔の時代を意味する単語であり、言葉に対して使うと「死語」を意味することになります。<br/><br/>最近の若者言葉は変化が激しく、数年前に流行したスラングなどを使っていると、「古の言葉」などと言われ年寄り扱いされるてしまいます。<br/><br/>「古」は本来文語で使われる表現ですが、「はるか昔のことに感じる」ということを強調する目的で、口語で使われることが増えてきているように感じます。<br/><br/>嘲りのニュアンスを含むことが多いので注意してください。
