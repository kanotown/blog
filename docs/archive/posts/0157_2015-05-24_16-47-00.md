Today, I tried to go to my university.<br/><br/>However, I couldn't enter the building because the card key wasn't found.<br/><br/>Perhaps, I left it with my wallet behind in my laboratory.<br/><br/>I contacted the laboratory's members, but everyone was taking a vacation.<br/><br/>I wanted to research at my university, but I am studying English at my apartment now.

私は今日、学校に行こうとしました。<br/><br/>しかし、カードキーが無かったので入れませんでした。<br/><br/>恐らく、財布と一緒に研究室の中に置き忘れたのだと思います。<br/><br/>研究室のメンバに問い合わせましたが、誰も居ませんでした。<br/><br/>大学で研究をしたかったのですが、今は家で英語の勉強をしています。
