<div class="date">Nov 13, 2015 12:10</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
There usually are foliage plants in Japanese banks.<br/><br/>In addition, almost all of the plants is 170 cm in height, and this figure is corresponding to the average height of Japanese men.<br/><br/>The reason for this is because you can measure the height of robbers when a bank robbery happens.<br/><br/>Besides, there are also some anti-crime measures, for example, there are no toilets in banks.

銀行の観葉植物<br/><br/>日本の銀行には、よく観葉植物が置いてあります。<br/><br/>しかも、その高さはほとんど170cmで、この数字はおよそ日本人男性の平均身長に相当します。<br/><br/>この理由は、銀行強盗に入られたときに、犯人の身長を測るためです。<br/><br/>その他にも、銀行にはトイレを設置していないなど、幾つかの防犯対策がとられています。
