# 【No. 0559】Hormone
<div class="date">Jun 29, 2016 19:46</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese cuisine "hormone."<br/><br/>The hormone is a standard menu of barbecue restaurants in Japan, and means innards that includes small bowel, large bowel, livers and hearts of cattle or birds.<br/><br/>Since "hormone" is written in Katakana, I've thought that this word came from "hormone" in English.<br/><br/>However, I found some sites that says something like "hormone is came from the Japanese phrase <em>hourumonn,</em> which means things that you throw away," then I was surprised and impressed.<br/><br/>After few hours, I realized that I was completely deceived.<br/><br/>According to a more reliable source, we referred to cuisine that enhance endocrine hormone as just "hormone," and now it mainly shows innards cuisine.

ホルモン<br/><br/>今日は、日本語のホルモンという食べ物を紹介します。<br/><br/>ホルモンは焼肉屋の定番メニューで、牛や鳥の大腸や小腸、肝臓、心臓を含む臓器のことを指します。<br/><br/>ホルモンはカタカナ表記のため、私はこれまで英語の「ホルモン」から来ているのだと思っていました。<br/><br/>しかしあるサイトで、日本語の「放るもん（捨てるもの）」から来ていると書かれており、そうだったのかと驚きました。<br/><br/>数時間後、騙されていることに気づきました。<br/><br/>しっかりと調べると、内分泌のホルモンを増強する料理のことをホルモン料理と呼ぶことが流行し、現在では主に内臓の料理を表すようになったとのことです。

You're welcome!^_^<br/><br/>&gt;That's interesting. I've never heard fried pork intestines :)<br/><br/>I'm not sure but I think it's similar to butayaki.

Thank you for the comment :)<br/>Since butayaki means roasted pork, I think it's a little bit different. I found the Japanese lesser-known meal "butamotsu no karaage" (fried pork innards), and this seem to be almost the same as Thai one :)
