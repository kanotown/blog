避暑地<br/><br/>夏の暑さを避けるため、一時的に涼しい場所に移動することを「避暑」と言います。<br/><br/>「避」は "avoid"、「暑」は "heat" を意味し、「避暑」は文字どおり "avoid the heat (of summer)" を意味します。<br/><br/>また、避暑のために訪れる土地のことを「避暑地」と言います。<br/><br/>「避暑地」は、明治時代に外国人の商人や宣教師が避暑のための別荘地を造ったのがはじまりとされています。<br/><br/>現在では、日本人の富裕層が避暑地に別荘を持つことは珍しくはありません。<br/><br/>別荘が無くても、ホテルや旅館を利用すれば短期的に避暑地を訪れることができます。

 It's funny, in Canada we have quite the opposite situation, where people have winter homes. I suppose you could call them 避冷：P　Would that be pronounced as ひひや？

Thank you for the correction!<br/>&gt; I suppose you could call them 避冷：P　Would that be pronounced as ひひや？<br/>Oh, that was close!<br/>This is not a common term, but avoiding the winter cold is called 避寒 (read as "hikan") -- 寒 (kan) means "cold."<br/>And the cultural difference is interesting. I heard that the climate of the Japanese famous 避暑地 called 軽井沢 (Karuizawa) is similar to Toronto's one.<br/>
