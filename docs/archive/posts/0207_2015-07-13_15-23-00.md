# 【No. 0207】Penalties for Drunk Driving in the World
<div class="date">Jul 13, 2015 15:23</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned various penalties for drunk driving in the world.<br/><br/>In some countries, there are horrible punishment.<br/><br/>For example, in El Salvador or Bulgaria,, the penalty is an execution by firing squad.<br/><br/>In Malaysia, the penalty is to be imprisoned with their spouses.<br/><br/>In Russia, the penalties persons can not drive cars in their lifetime.<br/><br/>In turkey, the penalties persons will be taken to a suburb, and they will be imposed  to walk about 32 km.<br/><br/>In Japan, the penalty is to be imprisoned or to pay a fine of one million yen.<br/><br/>I like Russian law.

 There is a famous saying: “The severity of Russian laws is balanced by the fact that their enforcement is optional.” ^_^
