おしゃかになる<br/><br/>何かがダメになることや、壊れて使い物にならなくなることを、「おしゃかになる」と言います。<br/><br/>「お」は丁寧の接頭辞で、「しゃか」は仏教の開祖である釈迦のことを意味します。<br/><br/>語源は諸説ありますが、有名なものは以下の説です。<br/><br/>ある鋳物職人が阿弥陀像を鋳ようとしていましたが、誤って釈迦像を鋳てしまいました。<br/><br/>このことから、「おしゃか」は使い物にならなくなったものを意味するようになりました。<br/><br/>この言葉は、以前紹介した「おじゃん」と似ています。<br/><a href="http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/175639051782742719229043226410411131950" target="_blank">http://lang-8.com/kanotown/journals/175639051782742719229043226410411131950</a>
