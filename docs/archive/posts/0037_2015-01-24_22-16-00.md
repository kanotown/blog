Thank you so much for kindly correcting me! :D<br/><br/>&gt; I don't know what you mean here?<br/><br/>I wanted to say something like "A human live with (parasitize) a kotatsu as if a parasite parasitize a plant." I wanted to compare a human who sit under the kotatsu to a parasite.<br/>I hope this makes sense.
