# 【No. 0794】Dosakusa
<div class="date">Feb 19, 2017 16:30</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese word "dosakusa."<br/><br/>"Dosakusa" means a situation that people are confused by sudden incidents or errands. <br/><br/>In most cases, it is used with "magirete," which means "to blend into something", something like "dosakusa ni magirete ~ suru" (to do something in the confusion).<br/><br/>Usage example: Dosakusa ni magirete party kara kaeru. (I escape from the party in the confusion.)<br/><br/>Some people say that this word comes from "bakuto gari" (to hunt gamblers), which was conducted to get workers at Sado Kinzan in the Edo period.<br/><br/>In this theory, "dosa" is a changed form of "sado," and "kusa" comes from "kusai," which means "to be sound like something" -- that is, "dosakusa" indicates a confusion of a gambling parlor in Sado Kinzan.<br/><br/>However, nowadays this thought is regarded as a vulgar belief.

どさくさ<br/><br/>今日は「どさくさ」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「どさくさ」は、突然の事件や用事で混乱している状態を表す言葉です。<br/><br/>ほとんどの場合、「どさくさに紛れて～する」といった形で用いられます。<br/><br/>例：どさくさに紛れてパーティから帰る。<br/><br/>この言葉は、江戸時代に佐渡金山での働き手を確保する際に行われた、博徒狩りに由来すると言われています。<br/><br/>「さど」をひっくり返して「どさ」、そして「～らしい」と意味する「くさい」と付け、佐渡金山の賭場の混乱ぶりをたとえたというものです。<br/><br/>しかし、現在ではこれは俗説とされているようです。
