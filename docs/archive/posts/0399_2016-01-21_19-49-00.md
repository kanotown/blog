ラブジョイ彗星<br/><br/>今日はオーストラリアのテリー・ラブジョイが2014年に発見したラブジョイ彗星(C/2014 Q2)を紹介します。<br/><br/>この彗星は緑色の光を発するのが特徴で、2015年1月に地球に大接近しました。<br/><br/>8000年に1度の機会だったそうです。<br/><br/>また、NASAによるとラブジョイ彗星は21種類の有機分子を含むガスを吹き出し続けているそうです。<br/><br/>その成分にはアルコール（エチルアルコール）も含まれており、その量は1秒間でワイン500本分だそうです。<br/><br/>ラブジョイという名前にふさわしい彗星かもしれません。

 Interesting! Speaking of comets, my favorite childhood book was "Comet in Moominland" by Tove Jansson)))

Thank you so much always for correcting mu post!<br/>Haha, actually I don't know about Moomins very much, but they are very famous in Japan. Also, I didn't know the movie "ムーミン谷の彗星" in 3D animation was released just a year ago.

 In the comics, a comet like that could give superpowers...

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/>That's interesting. I think the origin might be Halley's comet.

 Ah, that's so cool! ^^ I searched for the image online and I think the comet is beautiful. I missed it last year, so I don't think I will be able to see it again for my entire lifetime. Hahaha xD

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/>Haha, actually I also missed it. However, there are a lot of cosmic phenomenon that occurs once every millions/thousands/hundreds years!

You are very welcome :D<br/>Haha maybe we should check out more of these phenomenons. It would really be interesting to witness it personally!
