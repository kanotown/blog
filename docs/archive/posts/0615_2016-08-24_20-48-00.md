<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Saba wo Yomu</strong></em> (Fudge the Number)</h1>
<div class="date">Aug 24, 2016 20:48</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese word "saba wo yomu," which means "to fudge the number/count to advantage."<br/><br/>This phrase is often used for one's age, height, or weight.<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "saba wo yomu" is "to count chub mackerel," and there are several theories as the etymology.<br/><br/>One is that we count chub mackerel quickly and roughly because they are caught in large numbers and are perishable.<br/><br/>In addition, some says it comes from "魚市場読み (izana-yomi)," which means to count fish with a fast mouth at a fish market, and others say it's because we treat two piece of sashimi (sliced row fish) of chub mackerel as one piece.<br/><br/>By the way, to fudge the number/count to disadvantage is called "gyaku saba" (reverse chub mackerel).

サバを読む<br/><br/>今日は、「都合の良いように数字をごまかす」という意味の日本語である「サバを読む」を紹介します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、よく年齢や体のサイズ（身長、体重）に対して用いられます。<br/><br/>「サバを読む」の語源としては、幾つかの説があります。<br/><br/>一つは、サバは大量に捕れて傷みやすいので、急いでいい加減に数を数えていたという説です。<br/><br/>他には、小魚を早口で数える「魚市場読み（いざばよみ）」から来たという説や、刺鯖を2切重ねて1つとして扱っていたことから来たという説などがあります。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「都合の悪いように数字をごまかす」ことは、「逆鯖」と呼ばれます。
