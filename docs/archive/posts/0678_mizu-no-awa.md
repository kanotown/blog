# 【No. 0678】<strong><em>Mizu no Awa</em></strong> (To End in Vain)
<div class="date">Oct 26, 2016 21:50</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese idiom "mizu no awa."<br/><br/>"Mizu" means "water", "awa" means "bubble," and "mizu no awa" can express "bubbles that float on a surface of water" literally.<br/><br/>However, in most cases, it is used when you express that your efforts or works end in vain.<br/><br/>For example, when you say "my efforts become mizu no awa (bubbles on water)," it means that your efforts disappear like fleeting bubbles that float on water.<br/><br/>Also, there is another expression "suiho ni kisu," the literal meaning of which is "to return back to bubbles on water."<br/><br/>"Suiho ni kisu" has exactly the same meaning of "mizu no awa," but I think it sounds smarter (this is my personal opinion).

水の泡<br/><br/>今日は、日本の慣用句「水の泡」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「水の泡」は、文字通り水面に浮かぶ泡を意味することもできます。<br/><br/>しかし大抵の場合は、「努力がや苦労が無駄になること」を表す際に用いられます。<br/><br/>例えば、「努力が水の泡になる」と言うと、「努力が水の泡のようにはかなく消えてなくなる」という意味になります。<br/><br/>また、全く同じ意味を持つ「水泡に帰す」という表現を使って、「努力が水泡に帰す」のように言うと、格好いいと個人的に思います。

 Your English is perfect in this post! I don't think there is anything for me to correct. (or maybe because my sleepy eyes could not catch any mistake for now, but I think you are fine! :P )
