# 【No. 0485】Sweetness of Onions
<div class="date">Apr 16, 2016 15:20</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about onions.<br/><br/>Onions is the most sweet vegetable in the world, which includes fructose, glucose and sucrose.<br/><br/>However, since allyl sulfide included in onions is too strong pungent component, you will feel that raw onions are gingery.<br/><br/>Allyl sulfide is highly volatile, and this will be reason to cry when you cut onions.<br/><br/>Also, if you heat allyl sulfide, it will become propyl mercaptan, which has a high sugar content.<br/><br/>Although propyl mercaptan has fewer calories, it's said that the sweetness is 50 times as sweet as sugar.<br/><br/>Onions are an excellent ingredient that is delicious and nutritious if you cook it properly.

玉ねぎの甘さ<br/><br/>今日は玉ねぎについて話します。<br/><br/>玉ねぎは野菜の中で最も糖質が多く、果糖・ブドウ糖・ショ糖などを含んでいます。<br/><br/>しかし、辛味成分である硫化アリルなどイオウ化合物の刺激が強すぎるため、生で食べると辛さしか感じません。<br/><br/>硫化アリルは非常に揮発性が高く、玉ねぎを切る時に涙が出るのはこの成分が原因です。<br/><br/>また、硫化アリルは加熱すると、糖度の高いプロピルメルカプタンに変化します。<br/><br/>プロピルメルカプタンは低カロリーですが、砂糖の50倍の甘さを持つと言われています。<br/><br/>玉ねぎは、適切に調理すれば、非常に美味しく栄養価の高い料理を作ることができる優れた食材です。

 Onions are a core part of vegetarian pizza, if that's your thing. Without onions, the pizza would lose a great deal of taste.
