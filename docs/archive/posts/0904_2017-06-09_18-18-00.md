Have you ever deranged your way of speaking or the talk itself when you were nervous or got drunk.<br/><br/>Such a state is called "shidoro modoro" (しどろもどろ) in Japanese.<br/><br/>"Shidoro" comes from an adjective "shidoshinai" (しどしない), which means that someone is sloppy due to the disarrayed hair or clothes.<br/><br/>"Modoro" comes from a verb "modoroku" (もどろく), which means to be cluttered up, and it strengthens the meaning of "shidoro."<br/><br/>In the past, shidoro modoro meant only a state of drunken, but it has come to refer to that something is deranged in a board sense.

しどろもどろ<br/><br/>緊張したり、酔っ払うと、口調や話の内容がひどく乱れることはありませんか？<br/><br/>このような状態を、日本語では「しどろもどろ」と言います。<br/><br/>「しどろ」は「服装や髪が乱れていてだらしない」ことを意味する「しどしない」から来ています。<br/><br/>「もどろ」は「入り乱れる」という意味の「もどろく」から来ており、「しどろ」の意味を強めています。<br/><br/>かつて、しどろもどろはお酒に酔った状態を表していましたが、現在では広い意味で何かが乱れているようすを表すようになりました。
