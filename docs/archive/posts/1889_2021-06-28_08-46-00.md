<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Kao kara Hi ga Deru</strong></em> (顔から火が出る - One's Face Burned with Shame)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Jun 28, 2021 08:46</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kao kara Hi ga Deru</strong></em><br/><br/>When you feel very embarrassed about something and blush with shame, it can be described as <strong><em>kao kara hi ga deru</em></strong> (顔から火が出る) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>kao</em></strong> (顔) means "face," <strong><em>hi</em></strong> (火) means "fire," and <strong><em>deru</em></strong> (出る) means "to come out," the literal meaning of <em>kao kara hi ga deru</em> is "fire comes out of one's face."<br/><br/>You will feel very hot in the face when you are so embarrassed that your face turned red.<br/><br/>This phrase compares the heat in one's face to the heat so hot that it could start a fire.

顔から火が出る<br/><br/>とても恥ずかしくて顔が真っ赤になるようすを、「顔から火が出る」と表現することがあります。<br/><br/>「顔」は "face"、「火」は "fire"、「出る」は "to come out" を意味するので、「顔から火が出る」の文字どおりの意味は "fire comes out of one's face" となります。<br/><br/>顔が赤くなるほど恥ずかしいとき、顔がとても熱く感じると思います。<br/><br/>この顔の熱を、「火が出そうなほどの熱さ」にたとえているというわけです。
