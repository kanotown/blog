<div class="date">Dec 14, 2016 18:40</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese phrase "ocha wo nigosu."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "to roil tea", and it describes to manage to avoid an issue by saying something irresponsible.<br/><br/>It is said that this phrase comes from the fact that people who don't know sado (Japanese art of tea ceremony) roil tea so that it looks like appropriate Matcha.<br/><br/>In the past, Matcha was a special thing that only high rank people can drink.<br/><br/>Therefore most ordinary people didn't know how to make Matcha.<br/><br/>By the way, now sado is thought of as one of Japanese hobbies and has spread, but I don't know how to make Matcha.

お茶を濁す<br/><br/>今日は「お茶を濁す」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「お茶を濁す」とは、いいかげんなことを言って一時しのぎでその場をごまかすことを意味します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、茶道をよくわかっていない人が、お茶をかき回して濁らせて、それらしい抹茶に見えるよう取り繕ったことから派生したと言われています。<br/><br/>日本ではかつて、抹茶は位の高い人しか飲むことができない特別なものでした。<br/><br/>そのため、ほとんどの一般人は抹茶の点て方わからなかったそうです。<br/><br/>ちなみに現在では趣味で茶道を嗜む人もいますが、私は抹茶の点て方がわかりません。

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>Sounds great :) There is a lot of matcha sweets in Japan and I often eat them, but I rarely drink true matcha tea.
