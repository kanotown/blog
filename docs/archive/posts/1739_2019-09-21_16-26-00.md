# 【No. 1739】<strong><em>Tsuki</strong></em> (月 - Moon)
<div class="date">Sep 21, 2019 16:26</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Tsuki</strong></em><br/><br/>I like to see <strong><em>tsuki</em></strong> (月).<br/><br/><strong><em>Tsuki</em></strong> (月) means "moon," and there are several theories about its etymology.<br/><br/>One theory says that it comes from the term <strong><em>tsugi</em></strong> (次ぎ), which means "next," because the moon is bright next to the sun.<br/><br/>Another theory says that it comes from <strong><em>tsuki/tsuki-ru</em></strong> (尽き/尽きる), which means "run out," because the brightness of the moon runs out once a month.<br/><br/>Incidentally, it was announced that the game "Moon" for PlayStation released in 1997 will be distributed on Switch next month, then it has become a hot topic in Japan.

月<br/><br/>私は「月」を見るのが好きです。<br/><br/>「月」は "moon" を意味する単語で、語源は諸説あります。<br/><br/>ある説では、月は太陽の次に明るく輝くことから "next" を意味する「次ぎ」に由来するとしています。<br/><br/>またある説では、月に一度その輝きが尽きることから、"run out" を意味する「尽き（る）」に由来するとしています。<br/><br/>ちなみに先日、1997年発売のプレイステーション用のゲーム「Moon」がSwitchで配信されることが発表され、話題になりました。

Thank you for the correction!<br/>&gt; Do you mean the moon is bright because of the sun's light?<br/>Sorry, I wanted to mean that the brightness of the moon is the second largest (the brightest one is the sun).
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">仮名</span><br>
Ah, I see.<br/>"because the moon is second only to the sun in brightness."<br/>I know this sentence is a bit complicated, but I think it sounds the best.
