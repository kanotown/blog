マヨネーズ<br/><br/>私はマヨネーズが好きです。<br/><br/>おにぎりやパンの具材にもよくマヨネーズが使われるので、日本人はマヨネーズ好きが多いと思います。<br/><br/>しかし、マヨネーズの一人当たりの年間消費量が最も高い国は、圧倒的にロシアです（5.1 kg）。<br/><br/>ロシアの家庭では、料理1品にマヨネーズ1本近く使うこともあるそうです。<br/><br/>ロシアの冬はとても寒いので、マヨネーズでカロリーを補っているのかもしれません。

Thank you for the comment!<br/>&gt; Maybe that's because I don't eat mayonnaise )) Personally I think of it as a bad legacy of Soviet cuisine ))<br/>Oh, really? I heard that many Russian cuisine use mayonnaise, but you might be right. They could be Soviet cuisine.

&gt;Thank you for the comment!<br/><br/>You're welcome!<br/><br/>&gt;Oh, really? I heard that many Russian cuisine use mayonnaise, but you might be right. &gt;They could be Soviet cuisine.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, mayonnaise is used a lot even nowadays. But in the last few years more and more people consider it as a junk food.

Now I understand. Sorry and thank you. :D<br/><br/>&gt; But in the last few years more and more people consider it as a junk food.<br/>Thanks for letting me know it! No wonder the information source said that garlic mayonnaise (or ketchup mayonnaise) is often used as a dipping sauce for chips.

&gt;Now I understand. Sorry and thank you. :D<br/><br/>It's nothing. ^_^<br/><br/>&gt;Thanks for letting me know it! No wonder the information source said that garlic &gt;mayonnaise (or ketchup mayonnaise) is often used as a dipping sauce for chips.<br/><br/>To put it simple:  cheap mayonnaise that is sold in supermarket = junk food<br/>Homemade mayonnaise made with natural ingredients = not so bad ^_^

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/>Sorry for my confusing English. You're right, mayonnaise is usually used in breads like a sandwich. However, I also think sometimes mayonnaise is regarded as an ingredient of some breads in Japan, because the names of the breads include the word 'mayonnaise'. For example, there is a tuna mayonnaise bread（<a href="http://ameblo.jp/exokai/entry-11998408003.html）" target="_blank">http://ameblo.jp/exokai/entry-11998408003.html）</a>, a cone mayonnaise bread（<a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/tomikaai/archives/51740441.html）" target="_blank">http://blog.livedoor.jp/tomikaai/archives/51740441.html）</a>, and a sausage mayonnaise bread（<a href="http://conveniencesuki.gourmetblog.jp/e338871.html）." target="_blank">http://conveniencesuki.gourmetblog.jp/e338871.html）.</a>

The links you added didn't work, but I found this one: <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155978-corn-mayonnaise-buns-with-broccoli" target="_blank">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155978-corn-mayonnaise-buns-with-broccoli</a> Weird! ;)

Oh, I'm sorry. Since the links regarded the closing parenthesis as parts of the URLs, they probably didn't work. <br/>Yes, I also thought them (especially cone mayonnaise breads) weird initially, but now I'm fond of them. :)
