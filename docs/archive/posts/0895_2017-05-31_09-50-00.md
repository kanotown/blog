大変<br/><br/>程度や苦労はなはだしいことや、物事が重大であることを表す時、我々は「大変」という言葉を使います。<br/><br/>「大変」と聞けば、「つらい」「疲れる」「大事件」など、悪いイメージを思い浮かべる人が多いです。<br/><br/>実際、ほとんどの場合、「大変」は悪い意味で使われます。<br/><br/>しかし、「大変」という漢字は「大きな変化」という意味でもあります。<br/><br/>このことから、「大変」を「自分を大きく変えるチャンス」とポジティブに考える人もいます。<br/><br/>ただし、ネガティブのイメージが強いので、使う際には注意して下さい。

 I don't like it when people say 大変お世話になっております。What's so 大変 about it? I think it's one of those adverbs that don't do anything, like "very."

Yes, in such a case, "大変" is used as just something like "very."

if that is more natural, it is better to say 'taihen usually has bad connotations associated with it

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; I've often heard people say "大変ですね" as sympathy. Is that a correct way to use it?<br/><br/>Yes, "大変だね" is also okay. It's means just something like "That's tough," or "That's rough."

Thank you very much for your kind corrections and explanations!<br/>They're really helpful.<br/><br/>&gt; Also, it's common that after introducing a term subsequent appearances of the word are not marked. The only time I'd think you might continue to use quotes is if the word you've introduced is so common in English that the word might no be instantly recognized as Japanese.<br/>&gt; What do you think?<br/><br/>I didn't know which usage is common in English until today. In Japanese, it's common to place corner brackets around a term that you want to indicate. It's also common to place parentheses around the reading of the kanji/term, and place it inside of the corner brackets. For example, 「大変（たいへん）」. It's also used between English and Japanese, e.g.,「コンピュータ (Computer)」. Based on this rules, I've use quotes and parenthese but I'd like to use it in a common English style from now on.<br/><br/>&gt; Your posts really make me think. I'm starting to consider I should charge four times as much as I do now. Sigh.... $0 * 4 = $0 Oh well...<br/>Ah, I'm sorry for my puzzling texts. It would be greatly appreciated if you could feel free to comment without taking a lot of time. If you send me Japanese sentences, of course I will correct it carefully.

No need to feel sorry about your puzzling texts, I enjoy them myself. I enjoy the mental exercise. <br/><br/>should have ended it with "Oh well... ;o)"  Would that have clarified my poor attempt at humor? ;o)<br/>

You are welcome!. ;o)<br/><br/>You didn't mention if I was correct about this.<br/><br/>I'm thinking that taihen is referring to a state that a person is in if they are either very busy or suffering a hardship (suffering through something that is deadly/important) <br/><br/>I'm basing the rest of my comments based on that view point.<br/><br/>This was correct?

However, it is not necessarily used for a person, so used "something." For example, "大変な事件が起こった" (A terrible incident happened), "それｈた大変重要なメッセージだ" (That is a very important message).
