# International Women's Day
<div class="date">Mar 8, 2021 11:13</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
International Women's Day<br/><br/>Today, March 8 is International Women's Day.<br/><br/>The United Nations has designated March 8 as International Women's Day since 1987, and various events have been held in the world.<br/><br/>However, I heard the news that a Swedish ambassador to Japan said that he does not like this day.<br/><br/>According to the news, he said "It is strange to celebrate only this day as Women's Day," "Why can we celebrate even though we are in an unequal state," and "Every day should be a day of gender equality."<br/><br/>Indeed, I think that that is right.<br/><br/>On this day, it is perhaps better to think and discuss gender equality than to celebrate.

国際女性デー<br/><br/>今日、3月8日は「国際女性デー」です。<br/><br/>国連は1975年の3月8日以来、この日を「国際女性デー」と定め、世界でさまざまなイベントが行われてきました。<br/><br/>しかし、スウェーデンの駐日大使の方は、「国際女性デーが嫌い」と話しているというニュースを耳にしました。<br/><br/>曰く、「この日だけを女性デーとして祝うのはおかしい」「そもそも不平等な状態なのにどうして祝うのか」「毎日が男女平等の日であるべき」ということだそうです。<br/><br/>確かに、そのとおりのようにも思います。<br/><br/>この日は、祝う日ではなく、男女平等について考え議論する日、とすればよいのかもしれません。

 I think that they should talk about this in schools because the young kids are the ones who will grow up and become the teachers, doctors, and politicians of the future.

Thank you for the correction! :)<br/><br/>&gt; or do you mean, "However, I heard the news that a Swedish ambassador went to Japan and said that he does not like this day"?<br/>No, I wanted to say something like "a Swedish ambassador working at the Embassy of Sweden in Tokyo said that ..." (my dictionary says that such a person is referred to as "an ambassador to Japan").<br/><br/>&gt; I think that they should talk about this in schools...<br/>Yes, I agree with it.
