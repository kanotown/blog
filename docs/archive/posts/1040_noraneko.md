Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>Yes, I wrote "stray cat" in the title. I think that many Japanese people know the term because "Stray Cat" is a popular character of Japanese manga "JoJo no Kimyo na Bouken."<br/><br/>By the way, previously I treated Japanese words as countable nouns, such as "a noraneko/noranekos," but some commenters said that it's unnatural. (Now I'm confusing.) Do you think that I should regard Japanese words as countable nouns in most cases, or only some cases such as "noraneko?" (I understand some words like anime and manga are uncountable.)

To be honest, there is no strict convention about this. In general, we use articles with Japanese words but rarely pluralize them. However, when the word has become fully adopted into English like tsunami, it would be best to pluralize. Most people, especially those don't know any Japanese, will not notice.
