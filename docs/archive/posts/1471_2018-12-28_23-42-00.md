<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kiki Ippatsu</strong></em><br/><br/>If you want to describe an extremely dangerous situation, you can use <strong><em>kiki ippatsu</em></strong> (危機一髪) in Japanese.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ki</em></strong> (危) means "danger," <strong><em>ki</em></strong> (機) means "moment" or "chance," <strong><em>i/ichi</em></strong> (一) means "one," and <strong><em>patsu/hatsu</em></strong> (髪) means "hair."<br/><br/>That is to say, <em>kiki ippatsu</em> implies that a danger moment is approaching to you, and the distance is as long as one hair.<br/><br/>This idiom is often used to describe the past event, for example, <strong><em>kiki ippatsu de tasukatta</em></strong> (危機一髪で助かった - I had a close shave).

危機一髪<br/><br/>一つ間違えば非常に危ない状況のことを、「危機一髪」と言います。<br/><br/>「危」は "danger"、「機」は "moment/chance"、「一」は "one"、「髪」は "hair" を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち「危機一髪」は、「髪の毛一本ほどのところに危険が迫っている」ということを示唆しています。<br/><br/>「危機一髪で助かった」のように、過去のことに対して使うことが多いです。

 This is really interesting! I have a question about "危機一髪" now!
 <br/>
 Can you use it only in the context of shaving? Or can you use it as a metaphor, too? For example, if you are in a hurry to get on the train, can you say 危機一髪で乗れた? Or is this only for when having a shave?
 <br/>
 Fantastic writing! I especially like this part "the distance is as long as one hair."

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/>I'm glad to hear you say that. :)<br/><br/>&gt; can you say 危機一髪で乗れた? <br/>This sentence is a little unnatural. I think 危機一髪 is only used for when having a close shave/escape. Instead, 間一髪 can be used in several situations. Since 間 (kan) means a gap, 間一髪 literally means a hairbreadth gap. 間一髪で乗れた is a natural sentence.
