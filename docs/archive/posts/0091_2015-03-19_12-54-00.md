<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Most Japanese love baths, and get in a bath everyday.<br/><br/>We take average thirty three minutes for a bath, and this is the longest time in the world.<br/><br/>I'm also get in a public bath that is attached to a sport gym everyday.<br/><br/>Since I can relax and feel good by taking a bath, I usually take about an hour for the bath.<br/><br/>I think the public bath is also excellent as a place of communication.<br/><br/>However, when you take Japanese public baths or hot springs, note that there are some bathing etiquette as the followings:<br/><br/>・You must wash your body before you get in a bath.<br/>・You must not put your towels into a bath.<br/>・You must take a shower after you use a sauna.<br/>・You must wipe your body carefully before you return to a changing room.

日本人はお風呂が大好きで、ほぼ全ての人が毎日湯船に浸かります。<br/><br/>お風呂の時間が長い国ランキングでは1位となっており、一日平均33分程入っているそうです。<br/><br/>日本のスポーツクラブには大抵大浴場がついており、私はそこに毎日通っています。<br/><br/>お風呂はリラックスできて気持ちが良いので、私も大抵1時間程度入ります。<br/><br/>また、大浴場はコミュニケーションの場としても優れていると思います。<br/><br/>ただ、日本の銭湯や温泉に入る際は、以下のようなマナーがあるので注意して下さい。<br/><br/>・湯船に浸かる前に体を洗う。<br/>・タオルは湯船の中に入れない。<br/>・サウナに入った後はまずシャワーを浴びる。<br/>・脱衣所に戻る際は体をよく拭く。
