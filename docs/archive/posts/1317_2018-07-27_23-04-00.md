山々<br/><br/>「山」は "mountain," 漢字「々」は直前の漢字の繰り返しを意味します。<br/><br/>そのため、「山々」は "many mountains" や "mountains in various places" を意味します。<br/><br/>一方、この言葉は副詞的に使われることも多いです。<br/><br/>「〜したいのは山々だが」のように使い、何かをしたい気持ちが山のように高いが、実際にはできないということを意味します。<br/><br/>【例文】<br/>高級な肉を食べたいのは山々だが、お金がない。

<li class="corrected correct">
'Yama' (山) means mountains, and the kanji 々 means a repetition of the last character.
<p class="correction_comment">"Yama" --&gt; 'Yama' - Just following my own practice. ;o) Please let me know what you think of my posting rules.<br/><br/>"mountains" --&gt; mountains - Since you aren't just referencing the word itself and actually using it quotes aren't needed.<br/><br/>I've read your statement, "the kanji 々 means a repetition of the last character," before. It makes perfect sense to me. However, me being me, might these be an alternatives? <br/><br/>The kanji 々 means repeat the last character...  <br/><br/>The kanji 々 represents a repetition of the previous/last character. Therefore, 山々 is read as 'yamayama.'</p>

<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">Therefore, 山々 is read as "yamayama," and it means "many mountains" or "mountains in various places."</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
Therefore, 山々 is read as 'yamayama,' and it means"many mountains" or "mountains in various places."
<p class="correction_comment">Following my own rules.<br/><br/>I wrote "many mountains" and the other phrase with double quotes. I treated them as actual quotations. True, they may be your words, but by quoting them it spotlights the definitions so there's no ambiguity. I hope that makes sense.</p>

<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">If you say “~ shitai no wa yamayama daga” (～したいのは山々だが), it means that a feeling that you want to do something is high like mountains, but you cannot do it.</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
If you say “~ shitai no wa yamayama daga” (～したいのは山々だが), it means that a feeling that you want to do something is high like mountains, but you cannot do it.
<p class="correction_comment">Your sentence is understandable but feels a bit awkward. <br/><br/>What does “~" mean? If it's pronounced why doesn't it have a  romaji  representation? <br/><br/>Using double quotes here makes sense because it's effectively the same as a bit of dialogue. <br/><br/>If you haven't guessed already, I don't have any idea what I'm talking about here. ;o)<br/><br/><br/>... it means that the feeling you have related to something you want to do is so overwhelming, like  high mountains, that it seems like and you cannot do it.</p>

 I like your your periodic vignettes about Japanese phrases. They're always interesting.

Thank you so much for the corrections and helpful comments!<br/>I'm sorry for the late reply.<br/><br/>&gt; What does “~" mean? If it's pronounced why doesn't it have a romaji representation? <br/>"~" means that there is a sentence there. In English, I should have used "..." instead of "~".

Hi Toru, You are a bit behind aren't you? ;o)<br/><br/>And, as usual, a correction to my suggestion. <br/><br/>... it means that the feeling you have related to something you want to do is so overwhelming, like high mountains, that it seems like and you cannot do it.<br/><br/>seems like and you --&gt; seems like you - sorry about that <br/><br/>Thanks for the clarification on “~" <br/><br/>
