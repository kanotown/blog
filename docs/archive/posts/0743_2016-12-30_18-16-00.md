# 【No. 0743】<strong><em>Mushi no Shirase</strong></em> (Word of Insects)
<div class="date">Dec 30, 2016 18:16</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the idiom "mushi no shirase", the literal meaning of which is "word of insects".<br/><br/>"Mushi no shirase" means to feel that something will happen.<br/><br/>In many cases, this idiom is used to bad events, such as a death in family/friends, a traffic accident or a disaster.<br/><br/>There are two major theories as the etymology.<br/><br/>One is derived from the fact that in Edo period, people thought that insects lived in human bodies and they affected emotions and consciousness.<br/><br/>The other one is derived from the fact that in Taoism of China, it is thought that three insects are live in human bodies since humans were born, and these insects inform God of humans' guilts while humans are sleeping.

虫の知らせ<br/><br/>今日は「虫の知らせ」という慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>「虫の知らせ」とは、「何かが起こる予感がすること」を意味します。<br/><br/>この慣用句は多くの場合、「家族や友人の死」や「交通事故」、「災害」など、悪い出来事に対して使用されます。<br/><br/>語源としては、大きく二つの説があります。<br/><br/>一つは、江戸時代、人の体内には虫が棲んでおり、感情や意識に影響を与えていると考えられていたということに由来するというものです。<br/><br/>もう一つは、中国の道教では、人の体内には生まれたときから3匹の虫が棲んでおり、人が眠っている間にその人の罪悪を神様に報告していたとされてことに由来するというものです。

 It was hard to find any issues, good job! All I would suggest is to shorten your sentences to be a bit more simple.

 I swear your entries are some of the most interesting things I read in lang-8!

 Although insects don't live inside humans we do have a huge number of gut bacteria and they do impact on our mood and personality tremendously.
