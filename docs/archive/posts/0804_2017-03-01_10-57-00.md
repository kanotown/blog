# 【No. 0804】<strong><em>Rasubosu</strong></em> (Final Boss)
<div class="date">Mar 1, 2017 10:57</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the slang term "rasubosu."<br/><br/>"Rasubosu" is the abbreviation of "last boss," and it means a boss character that comes out on the final stage of computer games.<br/><br/>For example, it is Bowser in Mario series, or Ganondorf in Zelda series.<br/><br/>Since it is very difficult to beat rasubosu down, this word is also used in the meaning of "the last and most difficult hurdle" or "very strong competitor."<br/><br/>For your information, some Internet users refer singer Kobayashi Sachiko as "rasubosu."<br/><br/>This is because she sings at the end of the famous year-end TV program "Kohaku Uta Gassen" wearing very showy (and powerful-looking) clothing.<br/><br/>If you are interested in it, try to search with the keywords "小林幸子 ラスボス" on Google Images.

ラスボス<br/><br/>今日は俗語「ラスボス」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ラスボス」は「ラスト・ボス」の略で、コンピュータゲームにおいて一番最後に出てくるボスキャラクラーを意味します。<br/><br/>例えば、マリオシリーズであればクッパ、ゼルダシリーズであればガノンドロフなどです。<br/><br/>「ラスボス」は倒すのはとても難しいことから、ゲーム以外でも「簡単に勝てそうにない相手」や「最後の難関」などの意味で用いられることがあります。<br/><br/>ちなみに、インターネット上では、歌手の小林幸子さんのことを「ラスボス」と呼ぶ人が増えています。<br/><br/>その理由は、日本でとても有名な年末のテレビ番組「紅白歌合戦」において、番組の最後のほうで毎年ものすごく派手な（そして強そうな）衣装を着て歌うからです。<br/><br/>興味がある人は、「小林幸子 ラスボス」というキーワードで画像検索をしてみて下さい。

 Very interesting!  I've occasionally heard people in English refer to difficult challenges (like a big final exam for a class) as a "Final Boss" but it has never become so common as to have a recognized abbreviation like "ラスボス."

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/>And thank you for letting me know that interesting information :)<br/>I think that Japanese people tend to prefer to abbreviate/omit various words.

<p class="correction_comment">There are many possible abbreviations of "last boss", so we use "an" instead of "the".<br/><br/>Each computer game only has one final boss, so we use "the".<br/><br/>The final stage is not a physical location but a period of time (first stage, last stage), and so we use during.</p>
