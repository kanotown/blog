<div class="date">Feb 8, 2017 01:34</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I participated in a conference that has been held in Belgium.<br/><br/>Since my presentation is Day 2, I prepared my talk while watching other presenters' talk.<br/><br/>Sadly, I couldn't understand most of the contents of many presentations.<br/><br/>In particular, since people speak quickly in question and answer parts, I became very nervous.<br/><br/>I can't imagine that I survive the question and answer part.<br/><br/>Now I really want to throw out my presentation and run away to somewhere.<br/><br/>However, today I was able to be talk with other Japanese participants for a short time, so I felt a little relieved.

学会一日目<br/><br/>今日はベルギーで開催の学会に参加しました。<br/><br/>私の発表は二日目なので、今日は他の人の様子を見ながら、自分のプレゼンの準備をしました。<br/><br/>悲しいことに、ほとんどの発表の内容がよくわかりませんでした。<br/><br/>特に、質疑応答のパートが早口の人が多く、ものすごく不安になりました。<br/><br/>とてもまともに応答できる気がしません。<br/><br/>プレゼンを投げ出して逃げ出したいほど緊張しています。<br/><br/>ただ、今日は他の日本人参加者と少しだけ話せて、ちょっと気が楽になりました。
