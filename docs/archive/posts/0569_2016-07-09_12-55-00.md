# <strong><em>Ototoi Kiyagare</strong></em> (Come The Day Before Yesterday)
<div class="date">Jul 9, 2016 12:55</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to tell you about the Japanese expression "ototoi kiyagare."<br/><br/>"Ototoi" means "the day before yesterday," "kiyagare" means "come," and "ototoi kiyagare" means something like "get out, don't come again."<br/><br/>There are two theories that are related to the etymology of this expression.<br/><br/>One of them is that since "ototoi" has also the meaning of "distant day," "ototoi kiyagare" originally meant "don't come until the distant day."<br/><br/>The other one is that since to come the day after yesterday is impossible, "ototoi kiyagare" meant "it's too late."<br/><br/>There are a similar phrase in English; "come when two Sundays meet."

おとといきやがれ<br/><br/>今日は、日本語の表現「おとといきやがれ」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「おとといきやがれ」は、「二度と来るな」という意味であり、誰かを追い返すときなどに使われます。<br/><br/>この表現の語源は、大きく二つの説があります。<br/><br/>一つ目は、 一昨日が「遠い日」という意味を持つことから、「遠い日まで来るな」という意味であったという説です。<br/><br/>二つ目は、一昨日に来ることは不可能で手遅れという意味であったという説です。<br/><br/>英語にも、よく似た "come when two Sundays meet" という表現があります。

 Interesting phrase ^^
 <br/>
 I have a question : 二つの説で説明してた「～やがれ」は「やがる」という動詞に基づいたのか？(Does やがれ of both the meanings originate from the verb やがる？)
</p>

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>Yes, "やがれ" is the imperative form of "やがる" :)
