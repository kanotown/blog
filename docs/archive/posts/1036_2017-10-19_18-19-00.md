まな板<br/><br/>「まな板」は、調理で食材を切る際に、台として用いる板のことを指します。<br/><br/>「まな板」の「まな」は "fish," 「板」は "board" を意味します。<br/><br/>このため、かつて「まな板」は魚を調理に用いる板を表していたと考えられています。<br/><br/>少し前までまな板と言えば木製でしたが、最近では抗菌性に優れたプラスチック製やゴム製のものが一般的になっています。<br/><br/>ちなみに、胸の小さい女性に対して「まな板」という言葉は使わないように注意してください。<br/><br/>まな板は平らであることから、胸が小さく平らであることの隠語として使われることがあります。
