<h1 id="subject_show">Mikka Bozu</h1>
<div class="date">Jan 14, 2017 22:43</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese term "mikka bozu".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "three days guy", and it means that someone gives up easily, or means such a person.<br/><br/>Usage example: Although he declared that he would post on Lang-8 every day and he got all fired up about that, he was mikka bozu (he quit easily).<br/><br/>In Buddhism, once you become a priest, you have to wake up in the early morning, and do strict training every day.<br/><br/>Since some of people who became priests quit the training and return to a secular life in three days, this term was made.

三日坊主<br/><br/>今日は「三日坊主」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「三日坊主」は、飽きっぽくて長続きがしないことや、そのような人のことを意味します。<br/><br/>例：彼は毎日 Lang-8 に投稿すると意気込んでいたが、三日坊主だった。<br/><br/>仏教では、出家して僧になると、毎日朝早く起きて、厳しい修行をしなければなりません。<br/><br/>修行に耐えられず、三日で還俗する人がいることから、この言葉ができました。
