# <strong><em>Karacha</strong></em> (空茶)
<div class="date">Feb 21, 2018 12:03</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
When treating visitors in Japan, we often serve green tea with refreshments (Japanese confectionery).<br/><br/>However, if the visitor came to your home suddenly, you might not be able to serve refreshments.<br/><br/>In such a case, you should serve only green tea, and say 空茶でごめんなさい (karacha de gomennasai - I'm sorry, it's 'karacha').<br/><br/>空 (kara) means "empty" and 茶 (cha) means "(green) tea," but it doesn't mean that the teacup is empty.<br/><br/>"Karacha" means (green) tea that is served without refreshments.<br/><br/>If you are said as "I'm sorry, it's karacha," it will be better to express your feeling of apology toward the sudden visit.

空茶<br/><br/>日本では来客をもてなすとき、お茶にお茶菓子を添えて出します。<br/><br/>しかし、急な来客の場合はお茶菓子が無く、お茶だけを出すこともあります。<br/><br/>そのようなとき、「空茶でごめんなさい」のように言います。<br/><br/>「空」は "empty," 「茶」は "tea" を意味しますが、「お茶が空っぽ」という意味ではありません。<br/><br/>「空茶」は「お茶菓子が添えられていないお茶」を意味します。<br/><br/>もし「空茶でごめんなさい」のように言われたら、急に訪れたことを詫びる気持ちを伝えましょう。

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/><br/>&gt; If you say "...<br/>In this sentence, I assumed a situation that you visit a home suddenly and the host serves tea while saying "I'm sorry, it's karacha."<br/><br/>&gt; it will a good way ...<br/>I think that "be" is necessary here. Is my thought right?
