<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Tariki Hongan</strong></em> (他力本願 - Relying on Someone)</h1>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Tariki Hongan</strong></em><br/><br/>Relying on someone or leaving your work to someone is sometimes called <strong><em>tariki hongan</em></strong> (他力本願) in Japanese.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ta</em></strong> (他) means "other," <strong><em>riki</em></strong> (力) means "power," <strong><em>hon</em></strong> (本) means "true," and <strong><em>gan</em></strong> (願) means "wish," so you may think that this four-character idiom expresses its literal meaning.<br/><br/>However, both <strong><em>tariki</em></strong> (他力) and <strong><em>hongan</em></strong> (本願) are Buddhist terms -- <em>tariki</em> means "the power of Amitabha Buddha" and <em>hongan</em> means "a wish to have people become Buddha."<br/><br/>That is to say, originally <em>tariki hongan</em> means "to become a Buddha relying on the power of Amitabha Buddha."<br/><br/>It is thought that the meaning of "relying on someone" was made from the meaning of each kanji, then it became popular.

他力本願<br/><br/>他人の力を当てにすることや人まかせなことを、「他力本願」と言うことがあります。<br/><br/>「他」は "other"、「力」は "power"、「本」は "true"、「願」は "wish" を意味するので、この四字熟語は文字どおりの意味を表しているように聞こえるかもしれません。<br/><br/>しかし、「他力」と「本願」は仏教用語で、それぞれ「阿弥陀仏の力・加護」、「あらゆる人々を仏にする願い」を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち本来「他力本願」とは、「阿弥陀仏の力に頼って成仏すること」を意味する語というわけです。<br/><br/>各漢字の持つ意味から、「人まかせ」という意味の誤用が生まれ、それが定着したものと考えられます。

<p class="correction_comment">The meaning of the word "it" highlighted in blue is unclear. The word itself became popular, or that new definition of the word? I would change the last four words to: "and then this definition became popular."</p>

Thank you for the correction!<br/>&gt; The word itself became popular, or that new definition of the word?<br/>Sorry for my unclear sentence. I wanted to say that the new definition of the word became popular. However, the word itself also might have become popular in association with its new definition.
