# 【No. 0880】<strong><em>Uma no Hone</em></strong> (Person from Nowhere)
<div class="date">May 16, 2017 10:23</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the term "uma no hone."<br/><br/>"Uma" means "horse," "hone" means "bones," and "uma no hone" refers to a person from nowhere or an incapable person.<br/><br/>This term comes from the fact that Chinese said "firstly chicken ribs, secondly horse bones" as examples of useless things.<br/><br/>Chicken ribs are too small to be useful.<br/><br/>Horse bones are also useless, furthermore, it's difficult to dispose of them.<br/><br/>It's said that because of this, "uma no hone" has come to the current meanings described above.<br/><br/>In Japan, the phrase "どこの馬の骨ともわからんやつにうちの娘はやれん," which means "I never give my daughter to a man from nowhere (such as you)" is really famous.

馬の骨<br/><br/>今日は「馬の骨」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「馬の骨」は、素性の知れない者や、役に立たない者を意味します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、中国で役に立たないものを例えて「一に鶏肋、二に馬骨」と言っていたことに由来します。<br/><br/>「鶏肋」はニワトリの肋骨のことで、小さすぎて役に立ちません。<br/><br/>一方で「馬骨」は、役に立たないことに加えて大きすぎて処分にも困ります。<br/><br/>このことから、「馬の骨」は現在の意味を持つようになりました。<br/><br/>日本では、「どこの馬の骨ともわからんやつにうちの娘はやれん」というフレーズがとても有名です。

Today I will talk about the term "uma no hone."
<p class="correction_comment">Your sentence is fine as written.<br/><br/>Instead of using term you might take a look at the word idiom. I think that idiom would be a choice.</p>

<li class="incorrect">"Uma" means "horse," "hone" means "bones," and "uma no hone" refers to a person from nowhere or an incapable person.</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
"Uma" means "horse," "hone" means "bones," and "uma no hone" refers to a person from nowhere or an incapable person.
<p class="correction_comment">You're sentence is fine. <br/><br/>I'm going to change my opinion on using quotes again. There are just too many in this sentence.<br/><br/>What are your thoughts on this?<br/><br/>"Uma" means horse, "hone" means bones, and (")uma no hone(") refers to a person from nowhere or an incapable person.<br/><br/>Quoting the Japanese words the first time makes sense. I placed optional quotes around the full Japanese idiom. I could make arguments either way on using quotes here. I think that after this sentence you've introduced the Japanese words and idiom so you wouldn't really need to quote them in the remainder of the piece. <br/><br/>Thoughts?</p>

<p class="correction_comment">Your sentence is fine but it bothers me. If i wanted to use the idiom in an actual conversation I could see myself using three variations depending on the circumstances. Here are the three, in  most common to least common change of saying it, order<br/><br/>I would never give...<br/>I will never give...<br/>I never give <br/><br/>I hope this makes sense.  Which one would you use ?</p>

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/><br/>&gt; I could make arguments either way on using quotes here. I think that after this sentence you've introduced the Japanese words and idiom so you wouldn't really need to quote them in the remainder of the piece. <br/><br/>Actually, the reason why I continued to use quotes in the remainder parts is because I thought that "no" and "hone" of "uma no hone" are common English words, so it might be confusing witought quites. However, I also think that you have a valid point.
