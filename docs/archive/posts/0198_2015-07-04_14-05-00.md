Mosquitoes have a flight speed of 2.4 kilometers per hour, so they can't fly well against the wind produced by the fan.

 How interesting, I didn't know that. :O No wonder I'm always bitten by mosquitoes - I always wear bright or dark clothes!

Thank you so much for the correction, Sunny! :D<br/>Haha, maybe you always need anti-itch medicines.<br/>But be careful to a mosquito-borne disease.

Thankfully there aren't a lot of mosquitoes in California, so usually I'm ok. I just spent a week in Florida and got back an hour ago, and I have bug bites all over my legs. ;_;

<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
That's a relief. But all over legs... it's horrible!
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Sunny</span><br>
Ah, yeah. As long as I don't scratch it should be ok!! :)
