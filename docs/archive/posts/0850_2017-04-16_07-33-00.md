# Taisetsu
<div class="date">Apr 16, 2017 07:33</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I would like to talk about the Japanese word "taisetsu."<br/><br/>"Taisetsu" means something important, or to cherish something.<br/><br/>This word comes from "ooini seppaku suru," which can be abbreviated to "taisetsu" in Kanji.<br/><br/>Here, "ooini" means "very," "seppaku suru" means "imminent."<br/><br/>Originally, "taisetsu" literally means that something is imminent, but connected to this meaning, it came to mean that something is important.<br/><br/>Furthermore, since something important is something irreplaceable, it also imply "to love someone/something wholeheartedly."<br/><br/>In fact, a Portuguese dictionary translate "taisetsu" into "love."<br/><br/>In most cases, you can replace "taisetsu" with "juyo" (important), but I feel that "taisetsu" is softer and warmer than "juyo."

大切<br/><br/>今日は「大切」という単語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「大切」は、何かが重要であるさまや、何かを大事にするさまを意味します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、「大いに切迫する」を省略してできました。<br/><br/>もともとは文字通り「緊急を要するさま」を意味していましたが、そこから派生して「何かが肝要/重要なさま」を意味するようになりました。<br/><br/>さらに、重要なものはかけがえのないものであることから、「心から愛するさま」という意味も持っています。<br/><br/>実際、ポルトガル語辞書では「大切」を「愛」と訳すことがあります。<br/><br/>多くの場合、「大切」は「重要」に置き換えることができますが、「大切」のほうが柔らかくて温かい印象があります。

 &gt; Portuguese dictionary translate "taisetsu" into "love."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I've never seen this. Love in Portuguese is "amor" which in Japanese is either translated as 愛 or 好き
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The most complete online dictionary I could find doesn't have that meaning either.

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/><br/>&gt; Do you have a reference for that claim?<br/>Actually, according to the Internet, it's a very old dictionary. Its name is "日葡辞書 (Nippo Jisho)" (Vocabulário da Língua do Japão), and it was publiched only for a short period.<br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippo_Jisho" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippo_Jisho</a>
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">南蛮人</span><br>
That dictionary is over 400 years old!<br/>Maybe at the time the meaning of 大切 was different in Japanese.<br/><br/>I've actually read parts of that dictionary but probably not that part. The Portuguese orthography is very old. I can understand it, but it's strange.<br/><br/>I'll see whether I can find a copy check it out.<br/><br/>
