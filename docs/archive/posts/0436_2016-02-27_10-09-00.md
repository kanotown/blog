# 【No. 0436】Scholarships in Japan
<div class="date">Feb 27, 2016 10:09</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about a weird scholarship system in Japan.<br/><br/>Japanese scholarships are divided into three major categories, "benefit scholarship," "interest-free loan type scholarship," and "interest-bearing loan type scholarship."<br/><br/>Currently, about 60% of Japanese college/university students are using these scholarship systems.<br/><br/>However, the allocation of the benefit scholarship is very small, so almost all students have to borrow scholarship loans.<br/><br/>Furthermore, about 85% of them seem to borrow "interest-bearing loan type scholarships."<br/><br/>We call all these systems "scholarships(奨学金)," but I think that the loan type scholarships are just "student loans."<br/><br/>It can be called "debts."<br/><br/>It's not rare that Japanese people who went on to doctoral courses have debts of 10 million yen (90,000 dollars) when they graduate.<br/><br/>In fact, I heard many people are suffering from the repayments of the scholarships.<br/><br/>I think we should allocate more national budget to education fields.

日本の奨学金<br/><br/>今日は日本のおかしな奨学金制度を紹介します。<br/><br/>日本の奨学金は、大きく「給付型奨学金」「無利子貸与型奨学金」「有利子貸与型奨学金」の3つの分けられます。<br/><br/>日本の大学生の約60％が奨学金をもらって（借りて）いるそうですが、給付型奨学金の枠は非常に狭く、ほとんどが貸与型奨学金です。<br/><br/>更に、「有利子」で借りている学生は全体の約85％だそうです。<br/><br/>我々は「貸与型奨学金」を「奨学金」と呼んでいますが、このように返済義務があるものは単なる「学生ローン」だと思います。<br/><br/>別の言い方をすれば、借金です。<br/><br/>博士課程まで進学した人は、卒業時に借金が1000万近くになることも珍しくありません。<br/><br/>実際、多くの学生が奨学金の返済に苦しんでいるようです。<br/><br/>私は国の予算をもっと教育分野に割り当てるべきだと思います。

 I've heard that in the U.S. there are a lot of people who pay off their student loans until retirement.
