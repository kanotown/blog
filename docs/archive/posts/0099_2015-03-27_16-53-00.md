私はこれまで、理由を表すことができる接続詞 "because" と "since" と "as" の違いをあまり意識してきませんでした。<br/><br/>しかし、何度かこれらの使い方を添削されることがあったので、ニュアンスの違いを調べてまとめてみました。<br/><br/>・"Because" は、理由が重要なときや、理由が新しい情報であるとき、あるいは難しいことを説明するときに使われる。<br/>・"Since" は、理由が重要ではないときや、理由が既に知られているときに使われる。<br/>・"As" は、"since" よりも砕けた表現。<br/>・古い用法だが、"for" が理由を表す接続詞として使われることもある。<br/><br/>厳密な使い分けのルールは無いようなので、そんなに神経質にならなくてもよさそうですが、当たり前のことに "because" を使うと相手をバカにしたように聞こえるみたいです。<br/><br/>例：雨が降っているから、湿気が多い。<br/><br/>注意したいです。

<p class="correction_comment">Note: The last part is not a commonly used phrase at all! But I think the way I've formulated it is the way a native speaker would express this rather abstract idea. However, I get the feeling that however you express this idea, unless your listener is very sharp, you're going to have to explain what you mean in more detail anyway :)</p>

<p class="correction_comment">The other correction is good too, but I've written in it in a way that feels natural to me. A note: Although it's understandable, I would not use "become" here. I would always use "be." It's interesting that in the Japanese translation, this is not the case: "...神経質にならなくて..."!</p>

<p class="correction_comment">Hmmm... "matter of course" is not such a commonly heard phrase. I changed it to how I would translate your Japanese version, but by all means keep using "matter of course!" It's nice to be better than a native speaker :)</p>

 Interesting! I'll just say that I don't find anything mocking about the sentence "Because it is raining, it is humid." Maybe if it were used in a negative context, I might feel that way... for example:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Me: It sure is humid today.
 <br/>
 Friend: It's humid because it's raining, you idiot.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That would be mocking and insincere! But it would be just as mean for my friend to say:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It's humid since it's raining, you idiot.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 (Actually, to me, to use the word "since" sounds slightly strange to me; I'd only use "because.")
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Anyway, the point is, don't worry about offending people because you use the wrong word!
