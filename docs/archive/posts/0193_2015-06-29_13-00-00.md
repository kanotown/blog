# 【No. 0193】The Coin Which Has The Highest Value.
<div class="date">Jun 29, 2015 13:00</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Do you know the regularly used coin which has the highest value?<br/><br/>In the past, It was Japan's 500 yen coin that is almost 4 U.S. dollars.<br/><br/>In 2013, the 500 yen coin was introduced as the highest valued regularly used coins in the world on the Guinness Book of Records. <br/><br/>However, currently it is Switzerland's 5 franc, that is almost 5.3 dollars. <br/><br/>The reason is not only Japanese yen was breaking down, Swiss franc was inflated this year.

<p class="correction_comment">"5.3 dollars" is technically correct, but dollar amounts with cents are typically written with a $ sign and two decimal places, e.g. $5.30</p>

<p class="correction_comment">"breaking down" is usually meant for things that have stopped functioning, are falling apart, etc.  I hope that doesn't happen to the yen! :)</p>

 I've always found it interesting that 1-dollar coins have never really caught on in the US.  The government introduces them every few years and they tend to fall out of circulation soon after.  I guess we really like our $1 bills.

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>And thank you for letting me know the interesting story.<br/>I think once you get accustomed to use something, it's difficult to change the custom.<br/>Recently in Japan, 2000 yen bills were newly issued based on a theoretical efficiency, but we rarely use them, and finally the 2000 yen bills are not issued now.
