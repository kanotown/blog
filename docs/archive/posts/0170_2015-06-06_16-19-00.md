# 【No. 0170】Crossing Fingers
<div class="date">Jun 6, 2015 16:19</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
On my t-shirt, which is a gift from my American friend, crossing fingers illustration are printed.<br/><br/>I like it, so I often wear it.<br/><br/>In Europe and the United States, crossing fingers mean "cross" and "good luck."<br/><br/>However, the sign means something like "barrier from dirty things" in Japan, so actually we shouldn't use it too much.<br/><br/>Furthermore in Vietnam, I heard it means an insult.<br/><br/>Since the meanings of hand signs are different between countries, we have to be careful when we use them.<br/>
