<h1 id="subject_show">Phrases of American Dramas</h1>
<div class="date">Feb 25, 2015 19:25</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
　When I was watching an American drama, I was noticed that I could understand some phrases or words without Japanese subtitles. <br/><br/>For example, "you're insane" and "creepy" in "The Big Bang Theory," "you're an idiot" and "you idiot" in "Dr. House," "damn it" and "put your hands on your head" in "24."<br/><br/>I might have a dirty mouse if I keep watching these dramas repeatedly.<br/><br/>However, it is interesting for me to know various characters' trademark phrases.

<p class="correction_comment">Putting "when" at the beginning somewhat implies you don't watch dramas regularly, or maybe not at all any more. From the rest of your writing, it sounds like you do still watch them, and using "while" better implies this. Also, you talk about multiple shows, so we'll pluralise "drama" here.</p>

I might <span class="f_blue">get</span> a dirty <span class="f_blue">mouth</span> if I keep watching these dramas (repeatedly).
<p class="correction_comment">"Repeatedly" is implied by "keep watching", so it isn't necessary.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">Using "know" here makes it sound like this is an unusual thing for you to know about, but it's not uncommon to learn catchphrases even in other languages.</p>

 For the longest time, my Japanese was limited to mostly curses. Somehow they're just easier to remember.
