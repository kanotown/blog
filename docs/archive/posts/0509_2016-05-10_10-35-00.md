雨の匂い<br/><br/>これまで何度か匂いについて書いてきましたが、今日は雨の匂いについて書きます。<br/><br/>昨日は雨が降り、雨の匂いがしていました。<br/><br/>雨の匂いの原因物質として、ペトリコールとゲオスミンがあります。<br/><br/>ペトリコールはオーストラリアの研究者による造語で、ギリシャ語で「石のエッセンス」を意味し、雨の降り始めに発生する匂いを表します。<br/><br/>これは、特定の植物から生じた油が地面に吸着し、雨によって放出されることに起因しているとされています。<br/><br/>ゲオスミンはギリシャ語で「大地の臭い」を意味し、雨が降った後の独特な臭いの元とされています。<br/><br/>ゲオスミンは下水道から発生するカビ臭の原因物質でもあり、あまり良い臭いではありません。<br/><br/>私は長野県の雨の匂いは好きでしたが、東京の雨の匂いはあまり好きではありません。

 The smell of the rain in Warsaw is very refreshing, but the city isn't anywhere as dense as Tokyo.
