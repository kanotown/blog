# 【No. 1762】<strong><em>Tajitatan</strong></em> (多事多端 - Eventful)
<div class="date">Nov 15, 2019 22:30</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Tajitatan</strong></em><br/><br/>This is the first post for a month.<br/><br/>I could not write English essays on Lang-8 because I have been given a lot of work from several facilities.<br/><br/>To describe situations where you need to do many things and are busy, you can say the four-character idiom <strong><em>tajitatan</em></strong> (多事多端).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>ta</em></strong> (多) means "many," <strong><em>ji</em></strong> (事) means "thing," and <strong><em>tan</em></strong> (端) means "beginning/edge," the literal meaning of <em>tajitatan</em> is "many things and beginnings."<br/><br/>As you can image, a situation where there are many things that you have to begin is a very busy situation.

多事多端<br/><br/>1ヶ月ぶりの投稿となります。<br/><br/>最近私は大学の用務が忙しく、英語のエッセイを書けませんでした。<br/><br/>このようにするべき仕事が多く忙しいことを「多事多端」と言います。<br/><br/>「多」は "many"、「事」は "thing"、「端」は "beginning/edge" を意味するので、「多事多端」の文字どおりの意味は "many things and beginnings" となります。<br/><br/>多くの始めるべき事があるような状況は、忙しい状況であるというわけです。
