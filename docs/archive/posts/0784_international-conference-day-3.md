学会三日目<br/><br/>今日は国際会議の最終日です。<br/><br/>二日酔いでひどい気分でしたが、朝から発表を聞きに行きました。<br/><br/>そしてお昼ごはんの後は少し観光がてら、チョコレートを買いに行きました。<br/><br/>ルーベンの郊外にある Demeestere というお店で、とても美味しいという噂をネットで見つけました。<br/><br/>とても良い雰囲気で、ついつい大量に買い込んでしまいました（150ユーロ分くらい）。<br/><br/>その後は再び学会に行き、学会終了後は他の日本人参加者とブリュッセルに観光に行きました。<br/><br/>まずはグランプラス広場に行き、色々な店でチョコレートを買ったりワッフルを食べながら、小便小僧やギャラリー・サンチュベールなどを見て回りました。<br/><br/>とても充実した一日でした。
