# <strong><em>Shibō</strong></em> (しぼう - Wish/Death/Fat/Ovary)
<div class="date">Apr 25, 2023 13:51</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Shibō</strong></em><br/><br/>As you may know, the Japanese language has many homonyms.<br/><br/>Yesterday I typed <strong><em>shibō</em></strong> (しぼう) on my keyboard and nearly made a dangerous mistake when converting it to kanji.<br/><br/>What I wanted to type was <strong><em>shibō</em></strong> (志望), which means "wish," "desire," and "ambition."<br/><br/>However, the first result that appeared in the conversion candidates was 死亡, which means "death."<br/><br/>The text would have meant something completely different.<br/><br/>Since other possible conversion results include 脂肪, which means "fat," and 子房, which means "ovary," be careful when converting <em>shibō</em> to kanji.

しぼう<br/><br/>ご存知のとおり日本語には多くの同音異義語があります。<br/><br/>昨日はキーボードで「しぼう」と打ち、漢字に変換する際に危ない間違いをしそうになりました。<br/><br/>私が打ちたかったのは「志望」で、"wish" や "desire"、"ambition" などの意味を持つ言葉です。<br/><br/>しかし、変換候補ではじめに出てきたのは「死亡」で、"death" を意味します。<br/><br/>他にも "fat" を意味する「脂肪」や、"ovary" を意味する「子房」となる可能性もありますので、漢字変換の際は注意が必要です。
