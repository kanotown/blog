# 【No. 0517】<strong><em>Gamu</strong></em> (Gum)<strong><em>Gamu</strong></em> (Gum)
<div class="date">May 18, 2016 15:25</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about "gamu" and "gomu."<br/><br/>"Gamu" is an English loanword, and "gomu" is a Dutch loanword.<br/><br/>These words express different meanings respectively, because when they were imported into Japan, "gamu" expressed mainly "chewing gum," and "gomu" expressed mainly "rubber."<br/><br/>On the other hand, I heard that "gum" in English and "gom" in Dutch express both of their meanings.<br/><br/>By the way, in German, "gummi" expresses all of "gamu," "gomu" and "gumi."<br/><br/>In Japan (maybe also in other countries), both gamu and gumi are a kind of candy, but we refer to ones that disappear by chewing as gumi (gummy).

ガムとゴム<br/><br/>今日はガムとゴムについて話します。<br/><br/>ガムは英語のGum、ゴムはオランダ語のGomから日本に来た言葉です。<br/><br/>日本に入ってきたとき、ガムはチューインガムを、ゴムは天然ゴムなどの材料を指していことから、それぞれ異なる意味で定着しています。<br/><br/>しかし英語ではどちらもガムと言い、オランダ語ではどちらもゴムと言います。<br/><br/>ちなみに、ドイツ語ではガムもゴムもグミ（gummi）と言うそうです。<br/><br/>日本では（恐らく他の国でも）、ガムもグミもお菓子の一種ですが、噛んで無くなるものをグミと呼んでいます。

 Wow! I almost forgot that I was trying to correct your entry! Very good English!

And I forgot to add, very good use of commas to separate and sort your thinking. This kind of articulation seems to become harder and harder to come by these days.

These words express different meanings, because when they were imported into Japan, "gamu" <span class="f_blue">meant </span>mainly "chewing gum," and "gomu" <span class="f_blue">was </span>mainly<span class="f_blue"> used for</span> "rubber."
<p class="correction_comment">Corrected the recurring "express".<br/><br/>Also, here's an example of how to use "respectively":<br/><br/>"Gamu" and "gomu" were used as "chewing gum" and "rubber" respectively.<br/><br/>You can use it when you keep the same order in both parts of the sentence.</p>

By the way, in German, "gummi" expresses "gamu," "gomu" and "gumi."
<p class="correction_comment">You actually don't need to put either "all of" or "both" in there - this kind of meaning can be easily produced by stressing the "and" at the end.<br/><br/>I like apples, bananas  a n d  oranges. I like all three!</p>

In Japan (<span class="f_blue">and </span>maybe also in other countries), both gamu and gumi are a kind of candy, but we refer to<span class="f_blue"> the</span> ones that <span class="f_blue">dissolve as you chew them</span> as gumi (gummy).
<p class="correction_comment">"Swallowable" doesn't really make sense to me here, since regular, non-dissolving chewing-gum is pretty easy to swallow and you probably still wouldn't call it gumi.</p>
