初の一人で海外出張<br/><br/>今日は朝から荷物の準備をして、お昼頃にリムジンバスで成田空港に向かいました。<br/><br/>夕方頃に成田空港に到着し、日本円をユーロに替えたり、海鮮丼を食べたりしました。<br/><br/>ここは日本ですが、空港なので、色々なところから外国語が聞こえてきます。<br/><br/>流暢な英語の会話が聞こえてくると、自分にはとても無理だと思い、不安な気持ちになってしまいました。<br/><br/>ベルギーで自分の拙い英語がどれだけ通じるか、緊張します。<br/><br/>フライトのチェックイン可能時間までまだまだ時間があったので、今はラウンジでプレゼンを作ったりしています。

 What is a limousine bus?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I've heard these terms in Japan and never understood them. (also seat reservation in trains and other strange fees)
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I've travelled from Tokyo to Narita by bus many times, but I think it has always been by "regular" bus. I have no complaints, the buses were cheap (around 1000円) and comfortable.

</div><div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/>&gt; What is a limousine bus?<br/>Maybe a limousine bus is a little exclusive bus compared to a regular bus. However, I think that it is almost the same as a bus that you rode.<br/>By the way, the fare of the limousine bus from Narita to Tokyo is around 3000 yen.
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">南蛮人</span><br>
&gt; By the way, the fare of the limousine bus from Narita to Tokyo is around 3000 yen.<br/><br/>1.5 years ago I paid about 1000 JPY from Tokyo Station and it was totally fine. It's a short ride after all. I can't imagine the difference in comfort justifying a threefold price increase for a ride shorter than 1 hour! 
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
Yes, we can move from Narita to Tokyo Station by 1000 yen even now.<br/>I also can't justify the price, in a case you go to Tokyo Station.<br/><br/>However, limousine buses go to and stop at various stations including suburbs of Tokyo and surrounding prefectures. In any cases, the cost is around 3000 yen. 
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">南蛮人</span><br>
&gt; However, limousine buses go to and stop at various stations including suburbs of Tokyo and surrounding prefectures.<br/><br/>OK. That could justify it. I understand now.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to explain this to me.
