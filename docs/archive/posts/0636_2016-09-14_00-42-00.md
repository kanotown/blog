# Poison of Green Peppers
<div class="date">Sep 14, 2016 00:42</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I don't like green peppers.<br/><br/>Most Japanese children don't like green peppers too.<br/><br/>In addition, any mammal, such as cows or horses, doesn't seem to like green peppers.<br/><br/>Actually, green peppers contain a poison called "alkaloids", which produce a bitter taste.<br/><br/>(It's virtually harmless because the amount of the poison is less and we can degrade all of them.)<br/><br/>Therefore, hating green peppers is instinctive and very natural for mammals.<br/><br/>Palates of many human beings degenerate with maturity, and they become to like green peppers. <br/><br/>It's said that the reason why your palate degenerates is because the taste becomes unnecessary as your brain develops.

ピーマンの毒<br/><br/>私はピーマンが好きではありません。<br/><br/>ほとんどの日本人の子どもたちも、同様にピーマンが嫌いです。<br/><br/>そして、牛や馬などあらゆる哺乳類も、ピーマンが嫌いです。<br/><br/>実はピーマンには、アルカロイドと呼ばれる苦味を出す毒が含まれています。<br/><br/>（含まれる毒は少量で、人間はこれを分解できるので、無害です。）<br/><br/>すなわち、生物がピーマンを嫌うのは、本能的でごく自然なことなのです。<br/><br/>人間は、大人になるにつれて味覚が退化し、ピーマンを嫌いでなくなることが多いようです。<br/><br/>味覚の退化の理由は、脳の発達により味覚の必要がなくなるから、とも言われています。

返事がすごく遅れてしまってごめんなさい。<br/><br/>小さく切って熱を通せば、ピーマンの苦味は大分少なくなりますよね。私もそういうピーマンなら問題なく食べられます笑
