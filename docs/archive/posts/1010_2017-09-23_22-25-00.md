# <strong><em>Aki</strong></em> (秋 - Autumn)
<div class="date">Sep 23, 2017 22:25</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Japan, today is in the midst of "aki" (秋) -- this day is called "shūbun" (秋分).<br/><br/>"Aki" is one of the seasons, and it's located between summer and winter, that is, "aki" is autumn.<br/><br/>There are three theories about the etymology of "aki."<br/><br/>The first one is that it comes from the fact that the sky color of this season is clear ("clear" is translated into Japanese as "akiraka" (明らか)).<br/><br/>The second one is that it comes from the fact that crops are abundant in this season (it's expressed "akimitsuru" (飽き満つる) in Japanese)..<br/><br/>The third one is that it comes from "aka" (紅) -- in this season, leaves begin to turn red ("red" is translated into Japanese as "akai" (紅い)).<br/><br/>Young Japanese people tend to like "aki" (autumn) the most among the four temperate seasons.

秋<br/><br/>日本では、今日は「秋」の真っ只中です（「秋分」と言います）。<br/><br/>「秋」とは季節の一つであり、夏の後、冬の前に位置します。<br/><br/>「秋」という言葉の由来には、3つの説があります。<br/><br/>一つ目は、空の色が「明らか」な時期であることからというものです。<br/><br/>二つ目は、穀物などの収穫が「飽き満ちる」季節であることからというものです。<br/><br/>三つ目は、草木の葉が紅くなる季節であることから、「紅」が転じて「秋」になったというものです。<br/><br/>若い日本人は、四季の中で秋が最も好きな傾向にあります。

 Today is the first day of Autumn, yesterday being what we call the 'autumnal equinox'. It's my favourite season too.

Thank you so much for the correction! (^^)<br/>The Autumnal Equinox Day is a public holiday in Japan, but that day this year was Saturday, so it wasn't meaningful very much : (
