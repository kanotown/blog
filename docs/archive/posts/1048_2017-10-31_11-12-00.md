# <strong><em>Pīman</strong></em> (ピーマン - Green Pepper)
<div class="date">Oct 31, 2017 11:12</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Do you know what "green pepper" is called in Japanese?<br/><br/>As I wrote in this title, it's "pīman" (ピーマン).<br/><br/>This word comes from a French "piment" (or a Spanish "pimento"), which means "chilli pepper."<br/><br/>When it was brought to Japan, the term was slightly misunderstood, and we have come to call mild peppers (green/bell peppers) "pīman."<br/><br/>Although "pīman" comes from French, it is called "poivron" in French.<br/><br/>Incidentally, since "pīman" is written in katakana and has no kanji, most Japanese people understand that this is a loanword.<br/><br/>However, if a Japanese regard "pīman" as English and say something like "I like pīman (pee man)," he may be considered as a strange person.

ピーマン<br/><br/>"Green pepper" のことを日本語でなんと言うかご存知ですか？<br/><br/>タイトルにも書いたとおり、「ピーマン」です。<br/><br/>この言葉は、トウガラシを意味するフランス語 "piment" （もしくはスペイン語の "pimento"）に由来します。<br/><br/>日本に伝わる際に意味が少しずれて、日本では辛味のないトウガラシのことを「ピーマン」と呼ぶようになりました。<br/><br/>「ピーマン」はフランス語に由来するにも関わらず、フランス語では "poivron" と言います。<br/><br/>ちなみに「ピーマン」には漢字が存在せずカタカナ表記のため、ほとんどの日本人はこの言葉が外来語ということを理解しています。<br/><br/>しかし「ピーマン」を英語と勘違いして "I like pīman" なんて言ってしまうと、危ない人になってしまうかもしれません。
