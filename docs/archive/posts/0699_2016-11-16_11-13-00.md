700回目の投稿<br/><br/>今日で、700回目の投稿になります。<br/><br/>「今日は何を投稿しよう」とネタを探していたとき、ふと「投稿数 699」という数字が見えて気が付きました。<br/><br/>ネタ探しの労力が一日分減って、助かりました。<br/><br/>なんとか今日まで毎日投稿を続けることができていますが、最近は書くネタを選ぶのにとても時間がかかるようになってきました。<br/><br/>私の知っている雑学、日本の文化、言葉などはほとんど書いてしまったと思います。<br/><br/>これから何を書いていこうか、とても悩ましいです。<br/><br/>来年2月にはベルギーに行って学会発表することになったので、スピーキングとリスニングの練習をすべきかもしれません。
