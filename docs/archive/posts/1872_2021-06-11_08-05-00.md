# 【No. 1872】<strong><em>Kao ga Hiroi</strong></em> (顔が広い - Knowing Many People)
<div class="date">Jun 11, 2021 08:05</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kao ga Hiroi</strong></em><br/><br/>A person who has a large circle of acquaintances and knows people can be described as <strong><em>kao ga hiroi</em></strong> (顔が広い) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>kao</em></strong> (顔) means "face" and <strong><em>hiroi</em></strong> (広い) means "broad," the literal meaning of <em>kao ga hiroi</em> is "one's face is broad."<br/><br/>Here, <strong><em>kao</em></strong> (meaning "face") is used in the sense of "name recognition."<br/><br/>The synonym for <strong><em>hiroi</em></strong> (meaning "broad") is <strong><em>semai</em></strong> (狭い) (meaning "narrow"), but note that <strong><em>kao ga semai</em></strong> (顔が狭い) does not describe a person who has few acquaintances.

顔が広い<br/><br/>付き合いの範囲が広く、知り合いの数が多い人のことを、日本語で「顔が広い」と形容します。<br/><br/>「顔」は "face"、「広い」は "broad" を意味するので、「顔が広い」の文字どおりの意味は "one's face is broad' となります。<br/><br/>ここで「顔」は、「知名度」のようなニュアンスで使われているというわけです。<br/><br/>「広い」の対義語は「狭い」ですが、「知り合いが少ない」ことを「顔が狭い」とは言わないので、注意してください。
