# 【No. 1605】<strong><em>Ateji</em></strong> (当て字 - Phonetic Equivalent) Part 1
<div class="date">May 11, 2019 18:13</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Ateji</em></strong> Part 1<br/><br/>I used the Japanese word <strong><em>ateji</em></strong> (当て字) several times in my previous posts.<br/><br/>When looking up it in a dictionary, it is translated as "phonetic equivalent," but I think that the nuance is a little incorrect.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>ate</em></strong> (当て) means "to assign" and <strong><em>ji</em></strong> (字) means "character," the literal meaning of <em>ateji</em> is "assigned characters."<br/><br/>In actual situations, <em>ateji</em> has two different meanings.<br/><br/>One is to assign kanji characters to foreign or Japanese terms based on only the readings, ignoring the actual meaning of the kanji.<br/><br/>The other is to assign kanji characters based on only the meanings, ignoring the readings of the kanji.<br/><br/>To be continued.

当て字 Part 1<br/><br/>私はこれまでの投稿で、何度か「当て字」という日本語を使ってきました。<br/><br/>「当て字」で辞書を引くと "phonetic equivalent" が出てきますが、少しニュアンスが違うような気がします。<br/><br/>「当て」は "to assign"、「字」は "character" を意味するので、「当て字」の文字どおりの意味は "assigned characters" となります。<br/><br/>実際には、「当て字」は大きく二つの意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>一つは、漢字の本来の意味を無視し、読み方のみを考慮して外来語や和語に漢字を当てることです。<br/><br/>もう一つは、漢字の読み方を無視し、意味のみを考慮して外来語や和語に漢字を当てることです。<br/><br/>続く

<p class="correction_comment">Your sentence is also good. I think I like "can have" here though.<br/><br/>"However" is optional, but I think it flows nicely.<br/><br/>You might also hear someone say "but in reality, 'ateji' has two different meanings."</p>
