<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Warikan</strong></em> (割り勘 - Dutch Treat) Part 3</h1>
<div class="date">Sep 16, 2017 21:17</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I'd like to introduce expressions for "warikan" (割り勘 - dutch treat) in various countries.<br/><br/>In Italy, it is called "alla romana," which translated into "to pay like people of Roma."<br/><br/>In Romania, it is called "plăti nemțește," which is tsanlated into "to pay by German style."<br/><br/>In China, a senior or a person who invite others usually pay the all amount.<br/><br/>However, it seems that recent young Chinese tend to split the bill, and it's called "AA-sei" (AA制 - Algebraic Average System).<br/><br/>Also, it's especially called "Japanese AA-sei" (日本式AA制) when they want to imply a stingy/petty impression.

割り勘 Part 3<br/><br/>今日は、さまざま国の「割り勘」に相当する表現を紹介します。<br/><br/>イタリアでは「ローマ風に支払う」を意味する "alla romana" が使われます。<br/><br/>ルーマニアでは「ドイツ人式支払い」を意味する "plăti nemțește" が使われます。<br/><br/>中国では、基本的に年長者や食事に誘った人が全額支払うことが多いです。<br/><br/>しかし最近では学生を中心に、割り勘による支払いも増加しており、「AA制」（"Algebraic Average System" の意）と呼ばれているようです。<br/><br/>特に、「AA制」に「ケチ」などの印象を持たせる場合は、「日本式AA制」と呼ぶそうです。

 日本式AA制, really? Why not just use the Japanese word then? So childish)

Thank you so much always for correcting my post! :)<br/>I don't know why, but they might wanted to give a minus image to Japan.

You're welcome!<br/><br/>&gt;I don't know why, but they might wanted to give a minus image to Japan.<br/><br/>This only shows how thrifty at heart Japanese are.
