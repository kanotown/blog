<div class="date">Dec 21, 2015 12:08</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Yokohama Zoo "Zoorasia," cheetahs and zebras are living in the same area.<br/><br/>Since cheetahs are carnivores, you might think cheetahs would attack zebras.<br/><br/>However, there is no problem because cheetahs don't attack herbivores whose bodies are bigger than cheetahs.<br/><br/>In fact, zebras seems to be more strong than cheetahs.<br/><br/>By the way, lions are living in a different area.

チーターとシマウマ<br/><br/>よこはま動物園ズーラシアでは、チーターとシマウマが同じエリアで生活しています。<br/><br/>チーターは肉食動物なので、草食動物のシマウマを襲うと思うかもしれません。<br/><br/>しかしチーターは自分よりも体が大きい相手を襲わない性質があるため、問題はありません。<br/><br/>実際、シマウマはチーターよりも強いそうです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、ライオンは違うエリアで生活しています。

<p class="correction_comment">The sentence as written is okay, but it sounds generic. It could be talking about any cheetahs anywhere. The blue words make the sentence more specific to the cheetahs and zebras in the zoo that you mentioned in the last sentence.<br/><br/>You could also say "cheetahs are carnivorous," which is another form of the word "carnivore."</p>
