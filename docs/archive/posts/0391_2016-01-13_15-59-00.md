<div class="date">Jan 13, 2016 15:59</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
If your feet bottom or armpit is touched by somebody else, you will feel a tickle and laugh.<br/><br/>Why is that?<br/><br/>Since regions that artery passes close to your skin are danger, a lot of nerve is concentrated so as to be acutely aware of stimulation.<br/><br/>However, even if you touch such regions by yourself, you will not feel a tickle because your cerebellum will predict the stimulus and control it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if somebody else touches you, your brain will fall into chaos and generate an unpleasant sensation, because your cerebellum can't predict the stimulus.<br/><br/>This sensation is called tickling sensation, it make us laugh to relieve/escape the status.<br/><br/>There is experimental data that monkeys and rats also laugh when they are tickled.<br/><br/>By the way, tickling had been performed as a kind of torture at a time in the past.

くすぐり<br/><br/>他人に脇の下や足の裏を触られると、くすぐったく感じて笑ってしまいます。<br/><br/>これはなぜでしょうか。<br/><br/>動脈が皮膚に近いところを通っている部位は怪我をすると危険であるため、多くの神経が集まって刺激を敏感に感じやすくなっています。<br/><br/>しかし自分で触ってみても、小脳が刺激に対する予測と制御を行なうため、くすぐったくは感じません。<br/><br/>他人に触られると小脳が刺激を予測できないため、脳は混乱状態に陥り、不快な感覚を生じます。<br/><br/>これがくすぐったい、という感覚で、我々はこの状態を和らげたり、あるいは逃れるために、「笑う」という反応をするそうです。<br/><br/>サルやラットもくすぐりに対して笑ったという実験データも存在します。<br/><br/>ちなみに、かつては拷問の一つとしてくすぐりが行われていたそうです。

Sorry, I would correct this further : [Since these are regions where artery is close to your skin and any kind of external impact may be dangerous, many nerves are concentrated so as to be acutely aware of stimulation.] I believe this is what you want to say.

Yes, I forgot to add one fact. It's something like that you wrote, but I think it may be a little different.<br/>I wanted to mean something like "(regions where the artery passes close to your skin are dangerous, because) when we injure such regions, it can become lethal wound(deadly bleeding)."

I heard that the laughs of rats are expressed by high frequency chirping (unfortunately, we can't hear the sound).
