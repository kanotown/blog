# Nicchimo Sacchimo Ikanai
<div class="date">Jan 16, 2017 23:43</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the phrase "nicchimo sacchimo ikanai".<br/><br/>"Nicchimo sacchimo ikanai" means that something/someone is completely pinned down.<br/><br/>This phrase comes from an abacus term "nshin-mo sanshin-mo".<br/><br/>"Nishin" means "two divided by two", "sanshin" means "three divided by three", and both of them can be calculated without remainder.<br/><br/>From these terms, "nishin-mo sanshin-mo ikanai" (both nishin and sanshin can't go well) came to express that a number can't be divided by 2 and 3, then it came to mean that a calculation with abacus doesn't go well.<br/><br/>Furthermore it came to mean that business doesn't go well, finally it came to mean the meaning mentioned at the beginning.

にっちもさっちもいかない<br/><br/>今日は「にっちもさっちもいかない」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「にっちもさっちもいかない」は、行き詰まってどうしようもないようすを表す言葉です。<br/><br/>この言葉はそろばん用語である、「二進も三進も」に由来します。<br/><br/>「二進」は「2割る2」、「三進」は「3割る3」であり、どちらも余りなく計算ができることを意味します。<br/><br/>ここから「2でも3でも割り切れないこと」を「二進も三進も行かない」というようになり、「そろばんで計算がうまくできない」という意味になりました。<br/><br/>そして、「商売がうまく行かない」というような意味になり、上述のような意味になったとされています。
