<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Sebiro</strong></em> (背広 - Suit)</h1>
<div class="date">Dec 1, 2017 14:48</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
"Suit" is often called just "sūtsu" (スーツ) in Japan, but it sometimes called "sebiro" (背広).<br/><br/>The "se" (背) means "(person's) back" and the "biro/hiro" (広) means "wide," so I thought that the term "sebiro" derived from Japanese words.<br/><br/>However, according to the Internet, the most accepted theory about the etymology of "sebiro" is that "civil" of "civil clothes" changed to "sebiro."<br/><br/>Also, there is another theory that said that it comes from "Savile" of "Savile Row" where many well-established tailors have opened in London.<br/><br/>There are many surprises when I'm studying about etymologies.

背広<br/><br/>折り襟の紳士服のことを、「背広」と言うことがあります。<br/><br/>「背」は "(person's) back," 「広」は "wide" という意味を持つ日本語のため、私は「背広」の語源は日本語にあると思っていました。<br/><br/>しかし、最も有力な説は、軍服に対する市民服を意味する "civil clothes" の "civil" が変化して「せびろ」となったというものです。<br/><br/>また、ロンドンの老舗仕立て屋が多く並ぶ通り "Savile Row" の "Savile" が変化したという説もあります。<br/><br/>語源について調べていると、驚くことがたくさんあります。
