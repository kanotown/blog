# Let's Count Six Seconds
<div class="date">Oct 22, 2015 09:47</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
An emotion "anger" is very susceptible to the temporal mood.<br/><br/>It's said that you particularly get emotional within six seconds after you feel anger towards something.<br/><br/>Also, it's also said that a terrible anger emotion can persist for only a maximum of six seconds.<br/><br/>Therefore, if you feel anger towards something, please count six seconds calmly.<br/><br/>By doing this, you can prevent bad actions, and regrets will be reduced.

6秒数えましょう<br/><br/>「怒り」という感情は、そのときの気分に影響されやすいものです。<br/><br/>何かに怒りを抱いて6秒以内は、特に感情的になりやすいと言われています。<br/><br/>また、人間の怒りの感情が持続するのは、最長6秒間だとも言われています。<br/><br/>そのため、何かに怒りを抱いたら、まずは6秒数えるようにしましょう。<br/><br/>そうすれば、最悪なリアクションをしたり、後で後悔することが少なくなります。

Therefore, if you feel anger towards something, please count six seconds calmly.

By doing this, you can prevent bad actions, and regrets will be reduced.
<p class="correction_comment">Grammatically correct, but sounds a little unnatural. <br/>"By doing this, you can [stop/prevent] yourself from reacting harshly and have less regrets."<br/>Usually, we don't use the passive form, so "have less regrets" sounds more natural than "regrets will be reduced".</p>

Thank you very much for correcting my post again! :D<br/>&gt; I'm not entirely sure what "temporal mood" or "時の気分" means, but I suspect it means something like this.<br/>I think 'fickle' is very suitable for this situation! Thank you. :)<br/><br/>&gt; Usually, we don't use the passive form, so "have less regrets" sounds more natural than "regrets will be reduced".<br/>Actually, I've used a huge amount of passive form (especially when I write technical papers). However, I'll be more careful from now on!
