# 【No. 1413】<strong><em>Namida wo Nomu</em></strong> (涙を呑む - Swallowing Tears)
<div class="date">Oct 31, 2018 22:40</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Namida wo Nomu</em></strong><br/><br/>A few days ago, I took an action called <strong><em>namida wo nomu</em></strong> (涙を呑む) in Japanese.<br/><br/><em>Namida wo nomu</em> is an idiom that means to hold back one's tears when the one is about to cry due to regret, chagrin, or sorrow.<br/><br/><strong><em>Namida</em></strong> (涙) means "tear," and <strong><em>nomu</em></strong> (呑む) means "to drink" or "to swallow," so the literal meaning of this idiom is "to drink/swallow tears."<br/><br/>That is to say, this idiom implies that you hold back your tears by swallowing them.<br/><br/>I heard that the literal translation, "to swallow tears" and "to swallow/back down tears" can be used in the same meaning to this.

涙を呑む<br/><br/>私は先日、涙を呑みました。<br/><br/>「涙を呑む」とは、悔しさや無念さ、悲しさで泣きたいほどの気持ちのときに、涙を流さずにじっと我慢することを意味する慣用句です。<br/><br/>「涙」は "tear," 「呑む」は "to drink" や "to swallow" を意味するので、「涙を呑む」の文字通りの意味は "to swallow tears" となります。<br/><br/>出そうになった涙を体の内側に呑み込むことで、涙を堪えているというわけです。<br/><br/>英語でも同様に、"to swallow tears" や "to swallow back/down tears" のように言うようです。
