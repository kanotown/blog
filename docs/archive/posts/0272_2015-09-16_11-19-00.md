薬を飲む（Drink Medicine）<br/><br/>日本では、薬を飲むとき「薬を飲む」と言います。<br/><br/>それが錠剤であっても、粉末であっても、液体であっても同じです。<br/><br/>噛むものは「食べる（eat）」、飲み込むものは「飲む（drink）」を使うのだと思います。<br/><br/>カレーは飲み物だという人もいます。<br/><br/>それに対して「take」は、食べ物にも使えますし（例えば take a meal）、飲み物にも使えます（例えば take a cup of coffee）。<br/><br/>「take」は本当に様々な意味を持っていて、時に便利ですが、時に混乱してしまいます。

On the other hand, 'take' can used for both meals(e.g. take a meal) and drink(e.g. take a cup of coffee).<br/><br/>The sentence looks fine. My corrections came up funny. "take a meal" - this sounds a bit strange, "have a meal" is more natural.<br/><br/>"take a meal" means to take a meal from somewhere and take it to another place.<br/><br/>Sorry for strange format.

Thank you very much for correcting my post!<br/>I understand well. I bet "take a meal" is used for a buffet etc.!

<p class="correction_comment">There is nothing grammatically wrong with this sentence, these suggestions are just to make it sound more natural.<br/><br/>"I think" in this sentence means that you are unsure of what you are going to say next. I'm not sure if that is what you meant, but if you are confident of what you are saying, it should be removed.<br/><br/>In English, we "Swallow" food and drink. Maybe other speakers will disagree with me, but I feel that in this sentence it sounds strange. You might want to specify what you are swallowing by saying "liquids" instead of "something".</p>

<p class="correction_comment">This sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds out of place. You didn't mention anything about curry before or after this sentence. If you're writing this as a paragraph, it should be taken out.</p>

Thank you very much for the kind corrections!<br/>I learned something new! :D<br/><br/>&gt; I'm not sure if that is what you meant, but if you are confident of what you are saying, it should be removed.<br/>Actually, I felt that there were some exceptions, so I was not sure if what I said was correct.
