# <strong><em>Wan Wan and Nyan Nyan</strong></em> (ワンワンとニャンニャン- Doggie and Kitty)
<div class="date">Jul 5, 2018 19:48</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I would like to write about cats and dogs continuing from yesterday.<br/><br/>In Japan, a dog bark is represented as "wan wan" (ワンワン), and a cat's cry is represented as "nyan nyan" (ニャンニャン).<br/><br/>These terms are used not only as cries but also as baby words that refer the animal itself.<br/><br/>That is to say, "wan wan" and "nyan nyan" can mean <em>dog</em> and <em>cat,</em> respectively.<br/><br/>I think that these words correspond to <em>doggie,</em> <em>kitty,</em> or <em>meow</em> in English.<br/><br/>However, please note that somehow <em>nyan nyan</em> sometimes mean sexual activity.

ワンワンとニャンニャン<br/><br/>今日は昨日に引き続き、犬と猫の話題です。<br/><br/>日本で犬の鳴き声は「ワンワン」、猫の鳴き声は「ニャンニャン」です。<br/><br/>これらは単に鳴き声だけでなく、その動物を指す幼児語として使われることがあります。<br/><br/>すなわち「ワンワン」は犬、「ニャンニャン」は猫というわけです。<br/><br/>これらは英語での 'doggie,' 'kitty,' 'meow' に相当すると思います。<br/><br/>ただし、どういうわけか「ニャンニャン」は性行為を表すことがあるので、注意が必要です。

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/><br/>&gt; How would you use ’nyan nyan’ in a sentence for sexual activity? Could you give an example sentence? 例文<br/>When expressing the meaning, it is usually used with the verb 'suru' (する - do), for example, "nyan nyan suru" (ニャンニャンする).<br/><br/>Example:<br/>Kanojo to nyan nyan shita (彼女とニャンニャンした - I made love to my girlfriend).

 Hi Toru!  This post reminded me of another English words for cat, 'pussy' or 'pussy cat.'  'Pussy' can also be used as vulgar slang for a women's genitals or for someone who is weak or cowardly.

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>It's very interesting that both English and Japanese have the word linking cats and women. :)
