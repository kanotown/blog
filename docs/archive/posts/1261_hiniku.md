<div class="date">Jun 1, 2018 21:54</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I heard that English has many sarcasm and irony.<br/><br/>Sarcasm and irony are called hiniku (皮肉) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Hi (皮) means "skin" and niku (肉) means "flesh," so the literal meaning of hiniku is "skin and flesh."<br/><br/>This word came from the Buddhist term hiniku-kotsuzui (皮肉骨髄), which was used by Daruma Daishi (the founder of a Buddhist sect) to evaluate his desciples.<br/><br/>Kotsu (骨 - bone) and zui (髄 - marrow) imply "essential understanding," whereas hi (皮 - skin) and niku (肉 - flesh) imply "surface understanding."<br/><br/>Since hi and niku was a critical evaluation, hiniku came to have its current meaning.

皮肉<br/><br/>英語には多くの皮肉表現（sarcasm/irony）があると聞きました。<br/><br/>"Sarcasm" や "irony" は日本語で「皮肉」と言われます。<br/><br/>「皮」は "skin," 「肉」は "flesh" を意味するので、「皮肉」の文字通りの意味は "skin and flesh" となります。<br/><br/>「皮肉」の語源は、仏教で達磨大師が弟子たちの修行の評価に使った言葉「皮肉骨髄」にあります。<br/><br/>「骨」と「髄」はそれぞれ「本質的な理解」を示唆し、それに対して「皮」と「肉」は「表面的な理解」を示唆しています。<br/><br/>「皮」と「肉」は批判的な評価であることから、「皮肉」は現在の意味を持つようになったというわけです。

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/>It's interesting. 皮肉 has several meanings, but in my opinion, 皮肉 is closer to irony, whereas sarcasm is closer to 嫌味.
