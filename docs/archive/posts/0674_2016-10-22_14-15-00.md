# 【No. 0674】<strong><em>Gyofu no Ri</strong></em> (Fisherman's Benefits)
<div class="date">Oct 22, 2016 14:15</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the proverb "gyofu no ri."<br/><br/>"Gyofu" means "fisherman", "ri" means "benefits", and "gyofu no ri" is used as an example of that a third party grabs benefits without pain when two parties conflict with each other.<br/><br/>This proverb is derived from a Chonese story called "Sengoku strategies."<br/><br/>The story is something like the following:<br/><br/>A snipe tried to eat the inside of clam, but its beak was sandwiched.<br/><br/>The snipe said "you'll die in dry if you don't open the shell and return to the sea," but the clam said "you'll die in starvation if you don't pull out your beak."<br/><br/>Both of them stood firm.<br/><br/>Then a fisherman came here, and he caught both the snipe and calm.

漁夫の利<br/><br/>今日は「漁夫の利」ということわざを紹介します。<br/><br/>「漁夫」は「漁師」、「利」は「利益」のことで、「漁夫の利」は「二者が争っている隙に、第三者が苦労せず利益を横取りする」ことの例えとして使われます。<br/><br/>このことわざは、中国の故事「戦国策」に由来します。<br/><br/>その話は、以下のようなものです。<br/><br/>鴫が口をあけていたハマグリの肉を食べようとしましたが、くちばしを挟まれてしまいました。<br/><br/>鴫はハマグリに「口を開けて海に戻らないと水が切れてそのうち死ぬぞ」と言い、ハマグリは鴫に「くちばしを出さなければ飢えて死ぬぞ」と言い、どちらも譲りませんでした。<br/><br/>そこへたまたま漁師がやってきて、鴫とハマグリを両方とも捕まえてしまいました。
