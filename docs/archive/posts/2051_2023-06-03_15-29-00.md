Johnny-come-lately<br/><br/>ドラマを見ていたら「Johnny-come-lately」という表現が使われていました。<br/><br/>直訳すると「最近来たジョニー」ですが、実際には「新参者」や「遅れて来た者」を表します。<br/><br/>ここで "Johnny" は一般的な男性名である "John" の愛称であり、その他のさまざまな英語表現の中でも見られ、深い意味はありません。<br/><br/>「Johnny-come-lately」は17～18世紀頃に、イギリスやアメリカの俗語から派生したものと考えられています。<br/><br/>もともとは揶揄や軽蔑の意味を持ち、「新参者」「遅れてきた者」を歓迎しないときに使われましたが、現在では単にそのような人を指す際に使われることも多いようです。
