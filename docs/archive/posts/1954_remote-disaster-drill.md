# 【No. 1954】<strong><em>Remote Disaster Drill</em></strong> (リモート防災訓練)
<div class="date">Sep 1, 2021 10:35</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Remote Disaster Drill</em></strong><br/><br/>Today, September 1st, is <strong><em>Bousai no Hi</em></strong> (防災の日 - Disaster Prevention Day).<br/><br/>To deepen our awareness and understanding of natural disasters, disaster drills are often held on this day.<br/><br/>For example, assuming that a major earthquake or fire has occurred, students take disaster prevention actions such as hiding under desks and gathering in the schoolyard.<br/><br/>However, due to COVID-19, most of these events have been canceled this year.<br/><br/>Then, I received an invitation from my university to participate in a "remote disaster drill."<br/><br/>It consisted of just watching a total of about eight minutes of YouTube videos.<br/><br/>I doubt if this can be called a disaster drill.

リモート防災訓練<br/><br/>今日、9月1日は防災の日です。<br/><br/>この日にはよく、自然災害についての認識を深めるための、防災訓練が実施されます。<br/><br/>例えば、地震や火災が起こったことを想定し、机の下に隠れたり、校庭に避難したりします。<br/><br/>しかし、今年はコロナウィルスの関係で、こういった行事もほとんど中止となっています。<br/><br/>そして今朝、私は大学から「リモート防災訓練実施」の案内を受け取りました。<br/><br/>内容は、8分程の YouTube の動画を見るというものです。<br/><br/>防災訓練と呼べるかどうか、少し疑問です。
