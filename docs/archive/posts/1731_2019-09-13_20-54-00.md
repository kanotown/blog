<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Kubi no Kawa Ichimai de Tsunagaru</strong></em> (首の皮一枚で繋がる - Hanging by a Thread)</h1>

<strong><em>Kubi no Kawa Ichimai de Tsunagaru</strong></em><br/><br/>Today I would like to introduce a phrase that describes my current situation.<br/><br/>It is <strong><em>kubi no kawa ichimai de tsunagaru</em></strong> (首の皮一枚で繋がる).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>kubi</em></strong> (首) means "neck," <strong><em>kawa</em></strong> (皮) means "skin," "ichimai" (一枚) means "one layer," and <strong><em>tsunagaru</em></strong> (繋がる) means "to connect," the literal meaning of this phrase is "one's neck is connected only with one layer of the skin."<br/><br/>You may think that such a situation where one's head and body are connected only with the skin is already hopeless.<br/><br/>However, actually, this phrase is used to mean that something is not over yet or someone hangs by a thread.

首の皮一枚で繋がる<br/><br/>今日は、まさに私の今の状況を表すフレーズを紹介します。<br/><br/>それは「首の皮一枚で繋がる」です。<br/><br/>「首」は "neck"、「皮」は "skin"、「一枚」は "one layer"、「繋がる」は "to connect" を意味するので、このフレーズの文字どおりの意味は "one's neck is connected only with one layer of the skin" となります。<br/><br/>首が皮一枚で繋がっているような状況は、もう手遅れかもしれません。<br/><br/>しかし実際には、「わずかな望みが残っていること」や「ぎりぎりのところで持ちこたえること」を表します。

 Nothing really needs corrected here.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 All I can offer are other phrases that you may know that are similar to this one
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There's still ―" { hope / a glimmer of hope  }
 <br/>
 "All ― not lost " { is / hope is }
 <br/>
 "He's holding on by the ―" { skin of his teeth }"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I'm glad you still have hope to get out of your situation. Don't give up!
