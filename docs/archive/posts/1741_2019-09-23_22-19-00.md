サンマ<br/><br/>「サンマ」が美味しい季節になってきました。<br/><br/>"Pacific saury" を意味する「サンマ」は、一年中販売されていますが、漁獲シーズンの秋は特に脂の乗った美味しいサンマを食べることができます。<br/><br/>漢字では「秋」にとれる「刀」のような見た目の「魚」であることから、「秋刀魚」と書きます。<br/><br/>しかし、今年は不漁のため、サンマの価格が高騰しています。<br/><br/>数年前は1尾100円前後でしたが、今は300～400円ほどします。

Unfortunately, this year<span class="f_blue">,</span> the price of 'sanma' has <span class="f_blue">skyrocketed</span> due to the poor catch.
<p class="correction_comment">"Extremely" is usually used with an adjective, not a verb (for that, you can use "significantly"). Also, the word "skyrocket" is very nice in this situation.</p>

A few years ago 'sanma' was around 100 yen <span class="f_blue">per fish</span>, whereas it is around 300-400 yen each now.
<p class="correction_comment">I'm assuming 'sanma' is sold by each fish. Otherwise, you have to indicate the sale unit (per kilogram, for example) so it's clearer to the reader what "each" means.</p>
