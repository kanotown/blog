<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kreki mo Yama no Nigiwai</strong></em><br/><br/>The idiom <em>kareki mo yama no nigiwai</em> can describe a situation where even a something uninteresting is better than nothing.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>kare</em></strong> (枯れ) means "withered," <strong><em>ki</em></strong> (木) means "tree," <strong><em>yama</em></strong> (山) means "mountain," and <strong><em>nigiwai</em></strong> (賑わい) means "vibrancy," the literal meaning of <em>kareki mo yama no nigiwai</em> is "withered trees are also the vibrancy of a mountain."<br/><br/>Even withered trees can become a part of the mountain's decoration, which means that anything is better than nothing.<br/><br/>Note that this idiom is basically used for oneself, and it is impolite to use it for others.

枯れ木も山の賑わい<br/><br/>つまらないものでも、ないよりは良いという状況を「枯れ木も山の賑わい」と表現することがあります。<br/><br/>「枯れ」は "withered"、「木」は "tree"、「山」は "mountain"、「賑わい」は "vibrancy " を意味するので、「枯れ木も山の賑わい」の文字どおりの意味は "withered trees are also the vibrancy of a mountain" となります。<br/><br/>枯れた木であっても、山の飾りにはなるので、ないよりはあったほうが良いということです。<br/><br/>基本的には自分をへりくだっていう慣用句であり、他人に使うと失礼にあたるので、注意してください。
