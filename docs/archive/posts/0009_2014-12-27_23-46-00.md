<h1 id="subject_show">I Gave an Xperia Z3 for myself as a Christmas Present.</h1>
<div class="date">Dec 27, 2014 23:46</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I bought an Xperia Z3 which is a smartphone made by Sony in an electronics store.<br/><br/>I could purchase it at 0 yen because I used MNP(Mobile Number Portability system) and then discount campaign of MNP was applied.<br/><br/>However, since the monthly fee is 1,000 yen during 2 years, so practically I bought it 24,000 yen.<br/><br/>It was a little bit late, but as a christmas present, I gave the Xperia Z3 for myself.<br/><br/>Hehehe.

今日は、電気屋でSony製のスマートフォン、XperiaZ3を買いました。<br/><br/>番号ポータビリティ（MNP）で購入したので、キャンペーンが適用され、本体代金0円で購入できました。<br/><br/>月額料金が2年間の間1000円なので、実質24000円で買ったことになります。<br/><br/>少し遅くなってしまいましたが、私自身へのクリスマスプレゼントです。<br/><br/>へへへ。

Thank you so much for your correction!!(≧∇≦)<br/><br/>I god a silver green one because I thought it's unique and cool!<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; "An" is used before words starting with a vowel sound<br/>I thought that the word Xperia is pronounced "experia", as the word X-ray is pronounced "exray" (which startinf with a vowel sound). So I used "an" before "Xperia", but is the pronunciation of Xperia wrong..?

&gt;I god a silver green one because I thought it's unique and cool!<br/><br/>I personally like silver green the best, but the copper gold one is looking good too.<br/><br/>&gt;So I used "an" before "Xperia", but is the pronunciation of Xperia wrong..?<br/><br/>You are right, it seems I forgot how to pronounce Xperia in English. This was my mistake.

Ah, I misspelled the verb "got". XO<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; I personally like silver green the best, but the copper gold one is looking good too.<br/>Yes! I didn't know which one to choose silver green or copper gold!<br/>Both of them attracted me. (^^)
