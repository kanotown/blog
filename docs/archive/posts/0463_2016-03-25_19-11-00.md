# 【No. 0463】<strong><em>Hotaru no Hikari</strong></em> (Glowing Firefly)
<div class="date">Mar 25, 2016 19:11</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
March is the season of graduation in Japan.<br/><br/>In Japanese commencement ceremonies, we often sing "hotaru no hikari (glowing firefly)" as a farewell song.<br/><br/>The original song of "hotaru no hikari" is the Scottish folk song "Auld Lang Syne," which is comparable to the Scottish national anthem.<br/><br/>Also, "Auld Lang Syne" has spread all over the world. <br/><br/>Actually, Japanese people sing in favor of songs that were derived from Scottish folk songs in addition to "Auld Lang Syne."<br/><br/>One of the reasons is thought that the musical scale of Scottish folk songs is the same as the Japanese traditional one (5 musical scale).<br/>

蛍の光<br/><br/>日本では3月が、卒業式のシーズンです。<br/><br/>日本の卒業式では、よく別れの歌として「蛍の光」が歌われます。<br/><br/>「蛍の光」の原曲は、スコットランドの民謡「Auld Lang Syne」であり、この民謡はスコットランドの国歌に匹敵します。<br/><br/>また、「Auld Lang Syne」は世界中に普及しています。<br/><br/>実は、「Auld Lang Syne」以外にも、日本人はスコットランド民謡を原曲とした歌を好んで歌います。<br/><br/>その理由として、スコットランド民謡の音階は日本の伝統的な音階（5音階）と同じであることが挙げられます。

 We actually associate Auld Lang Syne with New Years. It's usually sung at new year's eve parties, although wikipedia tells me that it's also sung at funerals and other major events that have departure/farewell as a theme.

But I was quite surprised when I heard 蛍の光 at the graduation ceremony at my school. ...I was similarly surprised when another song was being practiced in music class, because it was originally a hymn in English, and somehow became secularized in Japan.

Many foreign songs have been imported into Japan, but many of us seem to sing them during special seasons (especially Christmas) without knowing the original version. So I think that Japanese might be also surprised when they find the original version. Actually, I believed that another popular song "仰げば尊し (あおげばとうとし)" was Japanese original song, but it was actually derived from "Song for the Close of School." Now I'm worried that many familiar Japanese songs that I know might not be Japanese songs, haha.
