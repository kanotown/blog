# April 2nd
<div class="date">Apr 2, 2018 10:52</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today is April 2nd.<br/><br/>I heard that the most number of babies are born in this day in Japan.<br/><br/>The reason is that April 2nd is the turn of the grade.<br/><br/>In Japan, people born on April 1st and people born on April 2nd have different school years.<br/><br/>That is to say, if a child is born on April 2nd, he/she will be the oldest student among his/her classmates.<br/><br/>I don't know details, but I also heard that some parents who give birth to their baby on April 1st change the birth date to April 2nd by adjusting the birth registration.

4月2日<br/><br/>今日は、4月2日です。<br/><br/>この日は、日本で最も多くの赤ちゃんが誕生する日でもあります。<br/><br/>この理由は、4月2日が学年の変わり目だからです。<br/><br/>日本では、4月1日に生まれた子と、4月2日に生まれた子は、学年が変わります。<br/><br/>すなわち、4月2日が誕生日であると、その学年で最も早く生まれた子になるというわけです。<br/><br/>詳しいことはわかりませんが、4月1日に子を産んだ親は、出生届を調整して4月2日生まれにすることがあるようです。

 I’m like that.  I was born in December, so I was the oldest among most of my classmates by a few months.

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>That's interesting :)<br/>Incidentally, the second and third most common birthdays in Japan are September 25th and December 25th.
