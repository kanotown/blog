# 【No. 0996】Bug in Lang-8
<div class="date">Sep 9, 2017 19:14</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Recently I can't see my posts on Lang-8.<br/><br/>I tried to see them with various web browsers, such as Chrome, FireFox, Safari, and EDGE,  and re-login several times, but the results were the same.<br/><br/>I have no idea about the cause, but other Lang-8 users seem to be unable to see my posts as well.<br/><br/>Only when I used a smartphone, I could browse them.<br/><br/>I'm very sad.<br/><br/>This post is containing a test.<br/><br/>I think that if I write sentences without my native language (Japanese), such a sad bug may be removed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have a feeling that it won't work.<br/><br/>If you have any solution, please let me know it.

&gt; スイちゃん<br/>本当に、早く復旧することを願っています。<br/>一応、公開範囲を変更することで、解決はできるようです。<br/><br/>&gt; LKRR-san<br/>This problem would be solved temporarily by changing "Access Settings."
