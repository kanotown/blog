<h1 id="subject_show">Sneeze</h1>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
When you sneeze, you will close your eyes naturally.<br/><br/>This is because to prevent your eyes from popping out (eyeball dislocation).<br/><br/>If you close your eyes strongly, your cheek muscles will rise, and your nasal cavity will expand.<br/><br/>As the result, the breathability of your nose will become smooth, and the pressure on your eyeballs will become suppressed.<br/><br/>Therefore, if you sneeze without closing your eyes, your eyeballs may pop out literally.

くしゃみ<br/><br/>くしゃみをするとき、私たちは自然と目をつぶります。<br/><br/>これは、目玉が飛び出さないよう（眼球脱臼しないよう）にするためです。<br/><br/>目を強く閉じると頬の筋肉が上昇し、鼻腔が広がります。<br/><br/>その結果、空気の通りが良くなり眼球への圧力が抑えられます。<br/><br/>そのため、目を閉じないでくしゃみをすると、文字通り目玉が飛び出すことがあるようです。

Thank you very much for the corrections and your comment! <br/><br/>&gt; Sorry, I don't understand why you're trying to say here. <br/>Sorry for my confusing English. I wanted to imply that this sentence and the above sentence has a causal relationship.<br/>That is:<br/>If you close your eyes tightly, your cheek muscles rises.<br/>If your cheek muscles rises, your nasal cavity expands.<br/>If your nasal cavity expands, the breathability (airway) of your nose becomes smooth.<br/>If the breathability of your nose becomes smooth, the pressure on your eyeballs will become suppressed.<br/>If the pressure on your eyeballs becomes suppressed, you can prevent your eyes from popping out.<br/>Therefore, if you close your eyes tightly, you can prevent your eyes from popping out. The mechanism is actually complex.

No problem! Thanks for explaining it, it's very interesting! Are you a medical student?<br/><br/>So I think the best way to phrase it is:<br/>As a result of the nasal cavity expanding, the pressure inside the nose is less intense, which therefore prevents your eyes popping out. <br/><br/>It may be best to seek a second opinion on this though. Your use of breathability and smooth confused me, so just be aware of how you use them next time :) Breathability doesn't mean airway and I have never heard of the word smooth being used in this context.<br/><br/>Best of luck!

Thank you very much for letting me know the best way!<br/>&gt; Are you a medical student?<br/>I'm an engineering student. Learning such trivial things is one of my hobbies, haha.<br/><br/>&gt; Your use of breathability and smooth confused me, so just be aware of how you use them next time :) Breathability doesn't mean airway and I have never heard of the word smooth being used in this context.<br/>Thank you for the advise! I'll be careful to use them. I learned something new, thank you again. :)

Thank you very much always for correcting my post! :)<br/>I think the correction is a so clever way to express my thinking.<br/>&gt; From now on I should be more careful when sneezing.<br/>Haha, actually there are almost no cases that eyeballs are popped out by sneezing.
