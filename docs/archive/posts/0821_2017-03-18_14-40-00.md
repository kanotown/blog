てんてこまい<br/><br/>今日は「てんてこまい」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「てんてこまい」は、とても忙しく、慌ただしく動き回っているようすを表す言葉です。<br/><br/>「てんてこ」は、里神楽などで用いる太鼓の音を表す擬音語で、「まい」はリズムに合わせて動くことを意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち、「てんてこまい」とは「太鼓の音に合わせて慌ただしく舞い踊る」ということを意味します。<br/><br/>「てんてこまい」に似た表現に、「きりきりまい」があります。<br/><br/>「きりきり」は物が回転するようすを表す擬態語で、「きりきりまい」はコマなどが片足で慌ただしく回ることから来ています。

<p class="correction_comment">Very interesting!   Given the analogy of a spinning top - could "kiri kiri mai" have the secondary meaning of not achieving much? I.e. spinning around in circles but not getting anywhere?  Thanks again for an interesting topic!</p>

Thank you so much for your corrections! :)<br/><br/>&gt; You mention "something is very busy". Typically, I have seen "very busy" associated with people. Do you mean "someone"?<br/>Ah! Yes, I wanted to mean "someone" instead of "something."<br/><br/>&gt; Very interesting! Given the analogy of a spinning top - could "kiri kiri mai" have the secondary meaning of not achieving much? I.e. spinning around in circles but not getting anywhere? <br/>Oh, I forgot to explain the detail. The reason why "kiri kiri mai" means almost the same as "ten teko mai" is because a spinning top looks like a person bustle about with one foot.

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>&gt; Did you mean "someone"? In English, things can't be described as "busy" or "hurriedly moving."<br/>Yes, I wanted to mean "someone." I think that since the verb "忙しい" (busy) is sometimes used for "something" in Japanese, I made the mistake.
