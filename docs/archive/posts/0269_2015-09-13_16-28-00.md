今日は TOEIC のテストを受けました。<br/><br/>前回から約8か月ぶりの挑戦で、少しわくわくしていました。<br/><br/>しかし残念なことに、テストの間、後ろの席の人が頻繁に大きな咳払いをしたり、鼻をすすっていました。<br/><br/>英語を聞いているときや読んでいるときに、大きな音がすぐ後ろから聞こえてきて、あまり集中できませんでした。<br/><br/>結局20問ほど解くことができなかったので、前回よりもひどい結果になりそうです。<br/><br/>音を気にしない集中力を身に着けたいです。

 Trying to do an exam with someone sniffling is always so annoying. There was someone like that in my final high school exams, and I remember it being so hard to concentrate.
