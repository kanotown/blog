# 【No. 0818】Kisei
<div class="date">Mar 15, 2017 23:25</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
An academic conference will be held at a university located in my hometown from tomorrow.<br/><br/>In order to participate in the conference, I went back to my hometown today.<br/><br/>Here, I used the word "帰省 (kisei)" in my sentences of native language version to mean to go back to my hometown.<br/><br/>Currently, it is not a mistake to say something like what I write.<br/><br/>However, '帰 (ki)' of "kisei" means to go back to your hometown, and "省" means to think about your family.<br/><br/>Therefore, thinking based on the original meaning, my sentence would be wrong.

<div id="post_ja"><div id="body_show_mo">
帰省<br/><br/>明日から私の地元の大学で学会が行われます。<br/><br/>その学会に参加するために、今日は実家に帰省しました。<br/><br/>「帰省」という言葉は、長期休暇などを利用し、一時的に故郷に帰るという意味でよく使われます。<br/><br/>現在では、「地元で開催される学会に参加するため帰省した」と言っても、間違いではありません。<br/><br/>しかし、「帰省」の「帰」は故郷に帰ることを意味し、「省」は両親を顧みる/安否を問うことを意味します。<br/><br/>そのため、本来に意味に基づいて考えると、私の文章は誤っていることになります。

<p class="correction_comment">(in blue)<br/>"it is not"<br/>It's more natural to either say "it's not" or "it isn't" instead of "it is not" in casual writing.<br/><br/>"Currently"<br/>It isn't wrong to use this, but it implies that sometimes it's wrong to say something like what you write.</p>

&gt; It isn't wrong to use this, but it implies that sometimes it's wrong to say something like what you write.<br/>It's sometimes wrong in earlier years, but it's not wrong in the current era.<br/>Should I use "nowadays" or something instead of "currently?"
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">JayfeatherRex</span><br>
No problem!<br/>Yes, "nowadays" would be better.
