# 【No. 0635】<strong><em>Shiri ga Aoi</strong></em> (A Blue Hip)
<div class="date">Sep 13, 2016 00:47</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese idiom "shiri ga aoi."<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "your hip is blue," but it actually means that someone is premature or young.<br/><br/>This comes from that infant hips are bluish.<br/><br/>The blue hip is called "moukohan" (Mongolian blue spot), and is often observed in Asian.<br/><br/>In particular, it is said that more than 90% of Japanese infants have the moukohan.<br/><br/>It's thought that the generation mechanism of the moukohan is related to pigment called "melanocytes".<br/><br/>Also, there is another idiom "kuchibashi ga kiiroi" (your beak is yellow), which have the same meaning of "shiri ga aoi."<br/><br/>This comes from that a baby bird have a yellow beak.<br/><br/>I think that this idiom is similar to "green horn" in English.

尻が青い<br/><br/>今日は日本語の慣用句「尻が青い」を紹介します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、「未熟であること」や「半人前で若いこと」を表します。<br/><br/>これは、幼児のお尻が青みがかっていることに由来します。<br/><br/>幼児の青いお尻は「蒙古斑」と呼ばれ、アジア人に多く見られます。<br/><br/>特に日本人の場合、9割以上の新生児に蒙古斑が見られるそうです。<br/><br/>蒙古斑ができる理由はメラノサイトという色素が関係していると考えられています。<br/><br/>また、「尻が青い」と同じ意味の言葉に、「くちばしが黄色い」という言葉があります。<br/><br/>これは、ひな鳥のくちばしが黄色いことに由来します。<br/><br/>英語で言うところの「green horn」（角の出始めた牛）に似ていると思います。

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>&gt; Greenhorn means someone with no experience or an amateur <br/>Thank you for teaching me! I think "shiri ga aoi" also implies something like that :)
