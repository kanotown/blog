# 【No. 2089】<strong><em>Take ni Suzume/Yanagi ni Tsubame/Momiji ni Shika</em></strong> (竹に雀/柳に燕/紅葉に鹿 - Match Made in Heaven)

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Take ni Suzume/Yanagi ni Tsubame/Momiji ni Shika</em></strong><br/><br/>In my post yesterday, I introduced the phrase "Ume ni Uguisu," which describes something harmonious or well-combined.<br/><br/>Expressions that carry similar meanings to this include <strong><em>take ni suzume</em></strong> (竹に雀), <strong><em>yanagi ni tsubame</em></strong> (柳に燕) and <strong><em>momiji ni shika</em></strong> (紅葉に鹿).<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>take</em></strong> (竹) means "bamboo," and <strong><em>suzume</em></strong> (雀) means "sparrow," the literal meaning of <em>take ni suzume</em> is "a sparrow with a bamboo."<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>yanagi</em></strong> (柳) means "willow," and <strong><em>tsubame</em></strong> (燕) means "swallow," the literal meaning of <em>yanagi ni tsubame</em> is "a swallow with a willow."<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>momiji</em></strong> (紅葉) means "autumn leaves," and <strong><em>shika</em></strong> (鹿) means "deer," the literal meaning of <em>momiji ni shika</em> is "a deer with autumn leaves."<br/><br/>These combinations are all used as high-scoring patterns in the Hanafuda (Japanese card game).

竹に雀/柳に燕/紅葉に鹿<br/><br/>昨日の投稿では、取り合わせのよいものの喩えとして「梅に鶯」という表現を紹介しました。<br/><br/>同様の意味を持つ表現は他にも「竹に雀」「柳に燕」「紅葉に鹿」などがあります。<br/><br/>「竹」は "bamboo"、「雀」は "spallow" を意味するので、「竹に雀」の文字どおりの意味は "a sparrow with a bamboo" となります。<br/><br/>「柳」は "willow"、「燕」は "swallow" を意味するので、「柳に燕」の文字どおりの意味は "a swallow with a willow" となります。<br/><br/>「紅葉」は "autumn leaves"、「鹿」は "deer" を意味するので、「紅葉に鹿」の文字どおりの意味は "a deer with autumn leaves" となります。<br/><br/>これらの組み合わせは、いずれも花札における得点の高い図柄として使用されています。

Thank you for the correction!<br/><br/>&gt; There’s a blue jay nest IN the maple tree outside my window.<br/>That sounds amazing! Although I haven't seen one in person, I agree that blue jays are such beautiful birds. It must be fascinating to have their nest right outside your window.
