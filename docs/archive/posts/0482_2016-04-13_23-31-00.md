# 【No. 0482】My First Seminar and Drinking Party
<div class="date">Apr 13, 2016 23:31</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, a graduate research seminar was held with my boss and students.<br/><br/>There were fifteen students, and it was difficult for me to remember all of their names.<br/><br/>However, I could remember easily some individualistic students' names.<br/><br/>Also, we held a drinking party at night.<br/><br/>Since I was able to talk with various nice people, I think it was a profitable time.<br/><br/>One disappointing point was that I couldn't finish the party smoothly because of my bad closing speech.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd like to support their graduation researches earnestly from now on.

初めてのゼミと飲み会<br/><br/>今日は、大学の先生と学生とで、卒業研究ゼミナールを行いました。<br/><br/>学生の数は15人ほどで、今日中に全員の名前を覚えることはできませんでした。<br/><br/>しかし、特徴のある子の名前は覚えやすかったです。<br/><br/>そして夜は、そのメンバで飲み会を行いました。<br/><br/>色々な個性を持った子と話せて、とても楽しかったです。<br/><br/>一つの残念な点は、私の下手な締めの言葉のせいで、うまく締まらなかったことです。<br/><br/>とにかく、これから彼らの研究を精一杯サポートしていきたいです。

<p class="correction_comment">Usually, there's three spots to place an adverb.  Either the beginning of the sentence, right before the verb, and at the end of the sentence or clause.  (You can search online for lots of information about this and which adverbs usually go where.)  In this case, you should pick either right before the verb or at the end of the sentence.<br/><br/>"Individualistic" isn't wrong but it's unusual.  Usually it means someone who is independent or an individualist rather than someone who is different from others or idiosyncratic.  "Idiosyncratic" is also not a very common word, but it's better.  "Peculiar" or "unusual" can sound a little negative.  So I reprhased the sentence to use "stand out."  "Someone who stands out" is someone who is different from others in a noticable way.</p>

Since I was able to talk with various nice people, I think it was <span class="f_blue">an enjoyable</span> time.
<p class="correction_comment">"Profitable" is a little bit of a strange choice, but I'm not sure what you mean.  You could say it was "profitable" if you got to talk to your boss or other important people at your school, maybe, but that sounds a little bit self-centered.  Since you said you talked to "nice people" I think "enjoyable" fits.</p>

 despotically's point about graduate research versus graduation project research is good.

 Speeches are hard! I don't mind public speaking, but I don't like the pressure of having to be both profound and funny.

Thank you very much for the corrections and explanations! :)<br/>I'm very afraid of such a pressure and being nervous, because my speeches will be regularly evaluated by professors.
