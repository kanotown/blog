# 【No. 0015】Dictation Practice Software was Completed Anyway
<div class="date">Jan 2, 2015 23:48</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Finally, I finished creating a dictation software program for improving my English.<br/><br/>At first, I tried to make the software using Java.<br/><br/>However, it was revealed that creating browser-like software using Java (without SWT) is not easy.<br/><br/>So, I began to learn the C# programming language from this morning.<br/><br/>I knew C# can create browser-like software easily and there are many common points between C# and Java.<br/><br/>To learn new programming language is exciting, but frustrating when I couldn't code as intended.<br/><br/>Result of the lengthy fight, the simple dictation software as follows was completed anyway.<br/><br/><a href="http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/dictation.jpg" target="_blank">http://kano.arkoak.com/daily/dictation.jpg</a><br/><br/>I'm going to improve my English using this software while improving this software gradually.<br/><br/>And today, the TopCoder contest was canceled (server error occurred) during the round. <br/><br/>I got really sad. <br/><br/>It was heartbreaking, ahh.
