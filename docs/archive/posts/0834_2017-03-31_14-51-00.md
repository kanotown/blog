# 【No. 0834】Zubora
<div class="date">Mar 31, 2017 14:51</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I talked about the Japanese word "kichomen," which means that someone is well-organized in every detail.<br/><br/>Today I would like to talk about the Japanese term "zubora." which has the opposite meaning to the "kichomen."<br/><br/>"Zubora" means that someone is loose and dissolute.<br/><br/>Usage example: Kare wa zubora na seikaku da. (His personality is zubora (loose).)<br/><br/>This word comes from dialect terms "zun bera bon," "zun bora bon" or "zuberabo," which means that something is flat.<br/><br/>There is also another theory -- it comes from a term in rice markets, "zubora," which meant that rice prices are continuous falling.

ずぼら<br/><br/>昨日は「隅々まできちんとしている」という意味の「几帳面」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>今日は、「几帳面」と正反対の意味を持つ、「ずぼら」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ずぼら」は、態度にしまりながく、きちんとしていないようすを表します。<br/><br/>使用例：彼はずぼらな性格だ。<br/><br/>この言葉は、凸凹がなく平らなさまを表す「ずんべらぼん」や「ずんぼらぼん」「ずべらぼう」とい方言に由来します。<br/><br/>また、米の相場がずるずると下がることを「ずぼら」と呼んでおり、そこから派生したという説もあります。
