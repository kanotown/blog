# 【No. 0666】<strong><em>Nuka Yorokobi</em></strong> (Short-lived Joy)
<div class="date">Oct 14, 2016 00:04</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "nuka yorokobi."<br/><br/>"Nuka" means pericarp and seed coat that are produced after polishing grains (bran), "yorokobi" means a joy, and "nuka yorokobi" expresses a short-lived joy.<br/><br/>Originally, "nuka" also expressed "small" or "fine" because of the look.<br/><br/>From this fact, it came to mean something like short-lived, and we came to refer to "a short-lived joy" as "nuka yorokobi."<br/><br/>For example, imagine a situation that you won the big lottery and went to a bank with joy, but one digit was actually different.<br/><br/>This is nuka yorokobi.<br/><br/>By the way, there is no relationship with today's topic, but this entry is the 666th post.

ぬか喜び<br/><br/>今日は「ぬか喜び」という日本の言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ぬか」は穀物を精白した際に出る果皮や種皮のことであり、「ぬか喜び」は「あてが外れて後で落胆するような一時的な喜び」を表します。<br/><br/>もともと「ぬか」はその見た目から、「小さい」「細かい」という意味を持っていました。<br/><br/>それが転じて「儚い」という意味を持つようになり、「儚い喜び」のことを「ぬか喜び」と表現するようになりました。<br/><br/>例えば、宝くじが当選したと思って喜んで換金所に行ったら、数字が一つだけ間違っていた状況を想像してみて下さい。<br/><br/>これがぬか喜びです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、今日のトピックとは全く関係ありませんが、この記事は666回目の投稿です。

"Nuka" means pericarp <span class="f_red">or</span> seed coat <span class="f_red">which</span> <span class="f_red">is</span> produced after polishing grains (bran), and "yorokobi" means <span class="sline"><span class="f_red">a</span></span> joy. <span class="sline">and</span> "<span class="f_blue">N</span>uka yorokobi" expresses a short-lived joy.
<p class="correction_comment">You could say Nuka means A or B, or it means A and B and I think both would be correct.  I think "or" is more natural, since pericarp and seed coat are two different things, so it sounds more natural as it can't be both at the same time.  <br/><br/>I think it's more natural to split the last section to a new sentence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="correction_field">
<li class="incorrect">From this fact, it came to mean something like short-lived, and we came to refer to "a short-lived joy" as "nuka yorokobi."</li>

From this fact, it came to mean something like "short-lived," and we came to refer to "a short-lived joy" as "nuka yorokobi."
<p class="correction_comment">I think I'd stick with the quotes around the definitions as in the previous sentence to keep it consistent.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">"where" you won, sounds more natural<br/>"a" big lottery, sounds more natural, as there are many big lotteries and you have not mentioned a specific one yet to refer to using "the"<br/>"the" bank sounds more natural (exception to the rule above I guess), but a better word is probably "lottery headquarters" since you don't cash in winning tickets at a bank :)<br/>"in" joy, sounds more natural once again.</p>
