 Are 湯船 and 風呂 two different names for the same thing? I have heard what some people have in their houses called 風呂.
 <br/>
 「湯船」と「風呂」と違いますか。

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/><br/>&gt; Are 湯船 and 風呂 two different names for the same thing? I have heard what some people have in their houses called 風呂.<br/>It's a little difficult question. 湯船 is mainly used to mean "bathtub," whereas 風呂 can mean both "bathtub" and "bathroom." If you say 風呂に入る, I don't know whether you will just take a shower or get in a bathtub. Also, you can say 風呂で湯船に浸かる (I get in a bathtub in a bathroom).
