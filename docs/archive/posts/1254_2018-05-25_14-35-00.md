<div class="date">May 25, 2018 14:35</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Yesterday, I did an act called hayatochiri (早とちり) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Hayatochiri means to make a mistake or fail due to one's hasty judgments.<br/><br/>Haya (早) means "early/quick," and tochiri (とちり) is a noun form of the verb tochiru (とちる), which means that an actor blows/fluff their lines or makes a mistake in acting.<br/><br/>The verb tochiru (とちる) came from tochimenbou (栃麺棒) -- here tochi (栃) means "Japanese horse chestnut," men (麺) means "noodle," and bou (棒) means "stick/rolling pin."<br/><br/>Since people had to use rolling pins hasty in order not to stiffen noodle, it came to mean to make a mistake or fail.

早とちり<br/><br/>昨日私は「早とちり」と呼ばれる行動をしました。<br/><br/>早とちりとは、早合点をして間違えることや、失敗することを意味します。<br/><br/>「早」は "early," 「とちり」は役者がセリフや演技を間違えることや、失敗することを意味する動詞「とちる」の名詞形です。<br/><br/>「とちる」は、栃の実の粉を原料にした橡麺を作るための棒、「栃麺棒」に由来します。<br/><br/>橡麺を作るとき、麺が固くならないようにせわしなく栃麺棒を扱ったことから、「間違える」や「失敗する」のような意味を持つようになったそうです。
