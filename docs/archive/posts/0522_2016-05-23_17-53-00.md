Yesterday, I went to an outlet mall, and bought some clothes after I finished my work.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I chose and bought a cloth for myself.<br/><br/>I think it's the first in 2 years.<br/><br/>I bought a thin jacket and, some shirts and pants.<br/><br/>Recently, I've worn a few clothes in rotation, so such new clothes will be a good refreshing change for me.<br/><br/>My colleagues might have thought something like "you always wear the same cloth," haha.

服の買い物<br/><br/>昨日は、研究を終えた後、アウトレットモールに行って服を買いました。<br/><br/>自分のために服を選び、そして買うのはとても久しぶりです。<br/><br/>約２年ぶりだと思います。<br/><br/>薄手のジャケットやシャツ、パンツなどを買いました。<br/><br/>最近ずっと同じ服ばかり着回していたので、良い気分転換になりそうです。<br/><br/>周りからは、「あの人いつも同じような服着てる」と思われていたかもしれません（笑）
