# 【No. 0535】<strong><em>Tsuyuiri</strong></em> (Rainy Season)
<div class="date">Jun 5, 2016 16:13</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, tsuyuiri was announced in the Kanto region in Japan.<br/><br/>"Tsuyuiri" means that the tsuyu season begins, and "tsuyu" means the long rain, which lasts for approximately a month around June.<br/><br/>In East Asia, four air masses struggle with each other from spring to summer.<br/><br/>Then, a stationary front called "baiu front" (the meanings of baiu and tsuyu are the same) is formed for thousands kilometers from east to west.<br/><br/>The baiu front moves to the north gradually over several months, and it rains continuously in regions near this front.<br/><br/>Since I often get a headache during the tsuyu season, it's painful to me.

梅雨入り<br/><br/>今日は、日本の関東地方で梅雨入りが発表されました。<br/><br/>梅雨入りとは梅雨になることで、梅雨とは6月頃に約一ヶ月降り続く長雨のことです。<br/><br/>東アジアでは、春から夏にかけて、性質の異なる4つの気団がせめぎ合います。<br/><br/>そして、気団の衝突によって、東西数千kmにわたって梅雨前線が形成され、数ヶ月かけて少しずつ北上していきます。<br/><br/>この前線付近に位置する地域では、雨が降り続きます。<br/><br/>私は梅雨の時期、頭が痛くなるので辛いです。
