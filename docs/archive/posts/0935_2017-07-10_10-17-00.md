<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Takabisha</strong></em> (高飛車 - Overpowering)</h1>
<div class="date">Jul 10, 2017 10:17</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Japan, there are many terms born from shogi (Japanese chess).<br/><br/>Today I will talk about the term, "takabisha" (高飛車), which means to apply coercive pressure or be overpowering.<br/><br/>"Taka" (高) of "takabisha" means "high," and "bisha/hisha" (飛車) means a kind of shogi pieces, that can move horizontally or vertically as much as you want just like a rook in chess.<br/><br/>Originally "takabisya" is a strategy moving a hisya (rook) to the highest place of your territory.<br/><br/>Since this strategy was aggressive and intimidating to the opponent, takabisha came to have the above meaning.

高飛車<br/><br/>日本には、将棋から生まれた言葉が沢山あります。<br/><br/>そんな中から、今日は「相手に対して高圧的な態度をとること」を意味する「高飛車」という、将棋から生まれた言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「高飛車」の「高」は "high," 「飛車」は水平・垂直方向にいくらでも進める将棋の駒（チェスのルークと同じ動き）を意味します。<br/><br/>もともと「高飛車」は、将棋において飛車を自陣の最も高い場所に移動させる戦法を意味しました。<br/><br/>この戦法は敵陣を威圧する攻撃的なものであったため、転じて高圧的な人も指すようになりました。
