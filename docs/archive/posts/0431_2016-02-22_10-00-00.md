# 【No. 0431】A Tanuki's (Raccoon Dog's) Sleep
<div class="date">Feb 22, 2016 10:00</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will write about a Japanese proverb "a tanuki's sleep (tanuki neiri)."<br/><br/>"A tanuki's sleep" is to pretend to be asleep when you feel bad. <br/><br/>The tanuki (raccoon dog) is a very timid animal, and pretends to be asleep (or loses consciousness) when it senses danger.<br/><br/>Since the figure looks like a pretended sleep that  deceives humans, we made the proverb "a tanuki's sleep."<br/><br/>For the same reason, there is an expression "play possum" that means "a pretended sleep" in English.<br/><br/>Also, there is another expression "a fox's sleep."<br/><br/>The reason is because foxes are sly and it's thought that they deceive humans.<br/><br/>By the way, I heard that there are little expressions like them except English and Japanese.

狸寝入り<br/><br/>今日は日本のことわざ、「狸寝入り」を紹介します。<br/><br/>狸寝入りとは、都合の悪いときなどに、眠ったふりをすることです。<br/><br/>狸はとても臆病な動物で、危険を感じたり驚いたりすると、死んだふりをします（あるいは気を失います）。<br/><br/>その姿が人間を騙すための「嘘寝」に見えることから、「狸寝入り」という言葉ができました。<br/><br/>同様の理由で、英語では「play possum (フクロネズミを演じる)」という表現があります。<br/><br/>また、英語では「a fox's sleep (狐の眠り)」とも言います。<br/><br/>これは、狐はとても賢く、人を騙すと考えられているためです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、このような表現は英語と日本語以外には無いそうです。

<p class="comment_small">
 "Play possum" actually has two meanings -- "pretend to be asleep" and "pretend to be dead". We also have a more direct expression "play dead". It used to be a common command for dog owners. (sit, stay, speak, roll over, play dead, etc).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I think if you expand the parameters of your idioms to include those that involve pretending to be dead, I'm sure you'll find a fair number of languages.

 I wasn't aware of this proverb; thanks for this entry.  I think it's really interesting that this expression only appears in English and Japanese.

 <br/>
 There's another proverb that is like that, and it can even be directly translated in both languages.
