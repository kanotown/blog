Thank you so much for correcting my post! :D<br/>&gt; I wasn't able to find the original source.<br/>I searched for the clear difference between "couldn't" and "wasn't able to" on the internet, but I couldn't(or wasn't able to?) figure it out. It would be very helpful if you could describe it. <br/><br/>&gt; It makes me want to play Super Mario.<br/>Haha, me too. :)

Could/Could not and Was able to/ Was not able to can be interchangeable, but the context will often decide which is chosen.<br/><br/>'Could not' と 'Was not Able to' の交換をすることができます。<br/>でも、特定の文脈で単語を選ばなければなりません。<br/><br/>This webpage is helpful- <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/122310/was-able-to-vs-could　" target="_blank">http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/122310/was-able-to-vs-could　</a><br/><br/>この場合は... 'Wasn't able to' sounds more fluent. <br/><br/>

 There is an article about this published in "Nature" (the world's most highly cited interdisciplinary science journal) :
 <a href="http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v19/n2/full/mp2013120a.html" target="_blank">
