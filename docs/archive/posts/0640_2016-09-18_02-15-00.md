# 【No. 0640】<strong><em>Honjitsu wa Seiten Nari</strong></em> (It's Fine Today)
<div class="date">Sep 18, 2016 02:15</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Japanese people often say "honzitsu wa seiten nari" when testing microphones or wireless applications.<br/><br/>In the radio station operation guideline, this phrase is defined as the test words when emitting radio signals.<br/><br/>Actually, this is the literal translation of "It's fine today," which is often used for microphone tests in English-speaking countries.<br/><br/>Since "It's fine today" contains plosive and fricative sounds that are difficult to pick up by microphones, and has a wide frequency band, it's thought that the phrase is optimal for testing microphones.<br/><br/>On the other hand, since the translated phrase "honjitsu wa seiten nari" doesn't contain such elements that should be checked in microphone tests, the Japanese version seems to be unreasonable.<br/><br/>I heard that Japanese public address engineers use "maiku chekku wan too" (microphone check one two) when they check microphones.

本日は晴天なり<br/><br/>日本では無線やマイクのテストでよく「本日は晴天なり」という表現を使います。<br/><br/>無線局運用規則では、無線局が試験電波を出す際に使う表現として定められています。<br/><br/>これは英語圏のマイクテストで使われる "It's fine today" を日本語に直訳したものです。<br/><br/>"It's fine today" の中にはマイクで拾いにくい破裂音や摩擦音が含まれ、かつ音の周波数帯が広いことから、マイク試験に最適とされています。<br/><br/>一方、ただそれを直訳した「本日は晴天なり」にはマイクテストで確認すべきさまざまな音は含まれておらず、適切とは言えません。<br/><br/>音響の仕事をしている人などは、マイクテストの際に「マイクチェック、ワン、ツー」と言ったりするそうです。
