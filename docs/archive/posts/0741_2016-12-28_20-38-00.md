Today I went to a professor's house and did mochitsuki.<br/><br/>The literal meaning of mochitsuki is "rice cake pounding", and it is a traditional Japanese event that is held around the new year.<br/><br/>In the mochituki, we pound boiled rice using a mortar and a pestle, and make mochi (sticky rice cake). <br/><br/>Unfortunately, since I had less stamina, physical strength, and experience, I couldn't pound mochi well.<br/><br/>On the other hand, professors and associate professors were getting used to the action, and they pounded mochi skillfully.<br/><br/>I could not contribute much to making mochi, but I ate very delicious mochi after the mochitsuki.

餅つき<br/><br/>今日は、大学の教授の家に行き、餅つきをしました。<br/><br/>餅つきは正月などに行う日本の伝統行事で、臼と杵を用いてもち米をつき、餅を作ります。<br/><br/>私は体力も腕力も経験も少なかったため、あまりうまく餅をつくことができませんでした。<br/><br/>一方、教授や准教授達は慣れた様子で上手く餅をついていました。<br/><br/>あまり貢献はできませんでしたが、その後に食べた餅はとても美味しかったです。
