# 【No. 0409】The Last TOEIC Exam in Schooltime
<div class="date">Jan 31, 2016 16:23</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I took a TOEIC exam.<br/><br/>Since it was the last TOEIC which I took as a university student, I hope that I can get a good score.<br/><br/>Also, I will graduate from my university after about two months, so no matter what I do, it might be the last action as a student.<br/><br/>I'd like to enjoy my last schooltime, so as not to leave regrets.<br/><br/>However, putting that aside, I have to overcome the dissertation presentation and the final examination of my doctoral program tomorrow.<br/><br/>If I cannot pass the exam, I must be a student for another half a year, haha.

学生時代最後のTOEIC<br/><br/>今日はTOEICの試験を受けました。<br/><br/>学生として受ける最後のTOEICなので、いい点がとれることを願っています。<br/><br/>卒業まで残り約２ヶ月なので、何をやっても学生最後の行動になるかもしれません。<br/><br/>悔いの残らないように謳歌したいと思います。<br/><br/>しかしそれよりも前に、明日の博士の最終試験を頑張らないといけません。<br/><br/>この試験を通らなかったら、もう半年間学生でいなければなりません。
