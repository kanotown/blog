# 【No. 0755】<strong><em>Origami Tsuki</strong></em> (Hallmark)
<div class="date">Jan 11, 2017 14:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese term "origami tsuki".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "attached origami", and it means that something is guaranteed to have reliable quality.<br/><br/>Here, "origami" means a document that is folded in half, and it has been used as an official document or a catalog since the Heian period.<br/>(Note that this "origami" is not a traditional Japanese art of folding paper.)<br/><br/>In the Edo period, the "origami" came to be also used as a certificate that guarantees that art or katana (Japanese sword) is not fake.<br/><br/>Then, "origami tsuki" came to have the above meaning.

折り紙つき<br/><br/>今日は「折り紙つき」という日本の言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「折り紙つき」とは、確かな品質があることが保証されたものに対して使われる言葉です。<br/><br/>ここで「折り紙」とは、紙を半分に折った文書のことで、平安時代から公式文書や目録として利用されてきました。<br/>（日本の伝統的な遊びの「折り紙」とは異なります。）<br/><br/>そして江戸時代には、美術品や刀などが偽物でないことを保証する鑑定書としても利用されるようになり、上述の意味を持つようになりました。

<p class="correction_comment">I think this wording sounds more clear, because it sounds to me like this "origami" is like a certificate of authenticity, right? We wouldn't say that a certificate is "attached," we would say it's "included."</p>

<p class="correction_comment">I am not sure what you mean by "catalog." A catalog is a list of items, such as items for sale by a company for example. Is that what you mean? Or did you mean a certificate, which is a document that guarantees something is genuine or high quality?</p>

Thank you very much for the corrections! :)<br/><br/>&gt; A catalog is a list of items, such as items for sale by a company for example. Is that what you mean? Or did you mean a certificate, which is a document that guarantees something is genuine or high quality?<br/><br/>I wanted to say "目録 (mokuroku)". According to the following page, it is a catalog of the level of ability of the instructor of the martial arts, but maybe I should have used another word.<br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokuroku" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokuroku</a>
