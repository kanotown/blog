オオグソクムシ<br/><br/>今日、ある先生から頼まれて、オオグソクムシのCT撮影をしました。<br/><br/>その先生はダンゴムシやグソクムシの研究をしていて、今回はオオグソクムシの内部を観察してみたいとのことでした。<br/><br/>CTによって外形形状だけは綺麗な3Dモデルが得られましたが、内部の臓器などはうまく得られませんでした。<br/><br/>オオグソクムシやダイオウグソクムシは深海生物で、魚の死骸などを食べることから、海の掃除屋とも呼ばれています。<br/><br/>彼らは飢餓に強く、日本の水族館にいたダイオウグソクムシは、なんと5年以上も何も食べずに生きていました（そのグソクムシは、餌を与えても食べようとしないのです）。<br/><br/>6年目に死んでしまいましたが、死因は病気だとされています。<br/><br/>彼らが何故何も食べずに生きていけるのか、まだ謎のままです。

Thank you very much for correcting me!<br/>I didn't know that the word "food" is an uncountable noun in most cases.
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Sunny</span><br>
Most of the time "food" is uncountable, but sometimes you may see sentences like "I ate a lot of different foods when I visited Greece," which you can think of as "types of food" in shorthand.

<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
Thank you so much for your informative comment, Sunny! (^-^)<br/>I thought I can use "fishes," "fruits," or "peoples." (but maybe I can't use "informations," "pollutions," or "sheeps" because these words are warned by spell checker.) 
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Sunny</span><br>
I think for some select uncountable words, you can use a plural form when you want to say "many different types of _____", usually for things we know to be diverse (like people, fruits, etc.) Since it's uncommon to think of pollution or sheep as diverse, they are fully uncountable. That's how I've reasoned it out, at least. :x
