<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
If you don't want anyone to find you, you will keep your body still and depress breathing.<br/><br/>Such an act is called 息を殺す (iki wo korosu) in Japanese.<br/><br/>息 (iki) means "breath" and 殺す (korosu) means "to kill," so the literal meaning of this "iki wo korosu" is "to kill one's breath."<br/><br/>It is thought that this idiom comes from the fact that if you kill (stop) your breath, it will be very quiet.<br/><br/>Also, some thought that the etymology is that "iki" means "life" or "soul," and if you kill it, it will be very quiet.

息を殺す<br/><br/>誰かに見つかりたくないときは、呼吸を抑えて動かずにじっとしていると思います。<br/><br/>このようなことを、日本語で「息を殺す」と表現します。<br/><br/>「息」は "breath," 「殺す」は "to kill" を意味するので、「息を殺す」の文字通りの意味は "to kill one's breath" となります。<br/><br/>息をまるで殺したかのように、静かにすることが語源だと考えられます。<br/><br/>また、「息」は命や魂を意味し、「死んだように静かにする」ことが語源だとする説もあります。
