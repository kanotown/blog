# 【No. 0235】Oyatsu
<div class="date">Aug 10, 2015 16:35</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to introduce the Japanese term 'oyatsu（おやつ）.'<br/><br/>Oyatsu means <em>snack,</em> but I think there are a little different nuances.<br/><br/>Since the time when we eat snacks was around 3 p.m in the past, so we often say "3時のおやつ（afternoon snacks eaten at about 3 p.m.）."<br/><br/>Actually, 'やつ' of 'おやつ' means the time about 2 p.m. to 3 p.m.<br/><br/>'お' of 'おやつ' means a just polite expression.<br/><br/>But these days, people who say the term <em>oyatsu</em> as the meaning of purely <em>snack</em> has increased.
