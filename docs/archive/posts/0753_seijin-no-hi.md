成人の日<br/><br/>今日は成人の日で、多くの日本国民にとって祝日です。<br/><br/>成人の日は、「おとなになったことを自覚し、みずから生き抜こうとする青年を祝いはげます」ことを趣旨とした日です。<br/><br/>この日、多くの市町村で今年度20歳を迎える新成人が招かれ、成人式が行われます。<br/><br/>女性は振袖、男性はスーツや袴などの正装に身を包み、参加します。<br/><br/>しかし、残念ながら近年、成人式で問題を起こす新成人が増えています。<br/><br/>早速先程、式典で暴れて逮捕者が出たというニュースがありました。

 I could only find one mistake in this, your English is amazing! I didn't know that people caused problems at the ceremonies, it's a shame when someone ruins it for everyone else.

 I still remember 3 years ago when I was there in the Kansai area.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It was quite the sight seeing all those young people with strange clothing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I think I also saw lots of girls carrying bows.

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>Sounds nice. The girls might participate in a big Kyudo (Japanese art of archery) event called 「通し矢」(toshiya) in Kyoto.

"Seijin no Hi" is held in order to congratulate and encourage all those who have <span class="f_blue">recently </span>become adults and are trying to become independent.
<p class="correction_comment">Your sentence is perfect, but the meaning is a bit unclear. If you just say "adults" it sounds like all adults, no matter what age. So maybe say "those who have recently become adults" or "those who have become adults this year."</p>

 Wow! I didn't know about people causing problems at these ceremonies before. What are they doing? Getting drunk and causing fights or something?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Anyway, thank you for always doing informative posts that are fun to read. :)
