# 【No. 0848】Mizu wo Mukeru
<div class="date">Apr 14, 2017 17:17</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese idiom "mizu wo mukeru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "mizu wo mukeru" is "to direct water at someone," and it means that you attract someone's interest or you work someone to talk what you want.<br/><br/>In Japan, miko (female attendant) can make spirits of dead and living human enter her body, and talk their words.<br/><br/>This is called "kuchiyose," the literal meaning of which is "to withdraw a mouth."<br/><br/>When mico conduct the kuchiyose, she puts water in a bowl, puts a leaf on water, and turns it toward a spirit -- the water is called "mizumuke" (to direct water at something).<br/><br/>Later, "mizu wo mukeru" came to have the current meanings.

水を向ける<br/><br/>今日は「水を向ける」という慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>「水を向ける」は、相手の関心をひくように誘いをかけることや、相手があることを話し始めるよう巧く仕向けることを意味します。<br/><br/>日本では、巫女が死霊や生霊、神仏などを自分の体に乗り移させ、その言葉を語らせることを「口寄せ」と言います。<br/><br/>口寄せをするとき、茶碗に水を入れて葉を浮かべ、霊体に差し向ける呼び水のことを「水向け」と言います。<br/><br/>これが転じて、自分の思うように相手に話をさせることを「水を向ける」というようになりました。

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/><br/>&gt; 水を向けるの例をもらえますか？<br/>For example,<br/>彼に水を向けたが、真相は聞き出せなかった。<br/>(I tried to have him tell the truth, but I got no change out of him.)
