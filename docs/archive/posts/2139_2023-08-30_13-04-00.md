<strong><em>Hana wa Oritashi Kozue wa Takashi</strong></em><br/><br/>The Japanese phrase, <strong><em>hana wa oritashi kozue wa takashi</em></strong> (花は折りたし梢は高し), can describe a situation where you want something but have no way to get it or things are not going your way.<br/><br/>Since <strong><em>hana</em></strong> (花) means "flower," <strong><em>ori/oru</em></strong> (折り/折る) means "to break," <strong><em>tashi/tai</em></strong> (たし/たい) means "want," <strong><em>kozue</em></strong> (梢) means "treetop," and <strong><em>takashi/takai</em></strong> (高し/高い) means "high," the literal meaning of this phrase is "want to break (a branch with) a flower, but the treetop is high."<br/><br/>It means you want to break and pick the branch with a flower, but the treetop is too high to reach.<br/><br/>This phrase carries a similar meaning to <strong><em>takane no hana</em></strong> (高嶺の花 - meaning "out of one's league"), which was introduced yesterday.

花は折りたし梢は高し<br/><br/>欲しいけれど手に入れる方法がないことや、思うようにいかないことを、「花は折りたし梢は高し」と言うことができます。<br/><br/>「花」は "flower"、「折り/折る」は "to break"、「たし/たい」は "want"、「梢」は "treetop"、「高し/高い」は "hight" を意味するので、「花は折りたし梢は高し」の文字どおりの意味は "want to break (a branch with) a flower, but the treetop is high" となります。<br/><br/>花の咲いている枝をとりたいけれど、梢が高くて手が届かないというわけです。<br/><br/>昨日紹介した、「手が届かないような魅力的な女性」を意味する「高嶺の花」と似た意味を持ちます。
