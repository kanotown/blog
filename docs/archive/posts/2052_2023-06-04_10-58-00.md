# Rook to Bishop Four
<div class="date">Jun 4, 2023 10:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Rook to Bishop Four<br/><br/>When watching the drama "Suits," I noticed the phrase "Rook to bishop four" was being used, with the Japanese subtitle <strong><em>ki wo sorasu noka</em></strong> (気を逸らすのか - meaning "distracting someone").<br/><br/>This phrase is thought to have originated as chess, but according to the internet, it was not a common idiom.<br/><br/>"Rook to bishop four" uses descriptive notation, an older system of chess notation. In this system, "bishop four" would refer to the fourth square where the bishop can move.<br/><br/>In algebraic notation, a modern system of chess notation, "rook to bishop four" would be "Rc4."<br/><br/>After all, the true intent of this phrase has not been clear, but I think it probably has a nuance of "strategic move" or "unconventional move."

Rook to Bishop Four<br/><br/>「SUIT」というドラマを観ていたら、"Rook to bishop four" という表現が使われており、日本語の字幕は「気を逸らすのか」となっていました。<br/><br/>チェスに由来する表現であると思われますが、インターネットで調べると一般的な慣用句ではないようでした。<br/><br/>"Rook to bishop four" は、チェスの手を示す古い記法（descriptive notation）で、ルークをビショップが移動可能な4番目のマスに移動させることを意味します。<br/><br/>現代の一般的な記法（algebraic notation）では Rc4 となります。<br/><br/>結局、この表現の正確な意図はよくわかりませんでしたが、恐らく「戦略的な一手」または「型破りな一手」のようなニュアンスを持つものであると思います。
