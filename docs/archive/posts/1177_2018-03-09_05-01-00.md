<h1 id="subject_show"><strong><em>Gota Gota</strong></em> (ごたごた - Jumbling)</h1>
<div class="date">Mar 9, 2018 05:01</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A situation where something jumbles disorderly or a bothersome thing is referred to as ごたごた (gota gota) in Japanese.<br/><br/>I think that most Japanese people believe that "gota gota" is an onomatopoeia representing that things are jumbled.<br/><br/>However, this term comes from 兀庵普寧 (Gottan Funei), Zen Monk,  who was invited from 宋 (Sou ie Song) in the Kamakura Period.<br/><br/>Gottan had a free-minded thinking but was an argumentative person, so it seemed that his preaching was complicated and very difficult to understand.<br/><br/>Because of this, jumbling was called 兀庵兀庵する (Gottan Gottan suru), and it has come to become "gota gota."

ごたごた<br/><br/>無秩序に乱れるさまや、面倒くさい事柄のことを、「ごたごた」と言います。<br/><br/>多くの日本人は「ごたごた」のことを、物が乱れているさまを表す擬態語だと考えていると思います。<br/><br/>しかしこの言葉は、鎌倉時代に宋から招かれた禅僧・兀庵普寧（ごったんふねい）の名前に由来します。<br/><br/>兀庵は自由な発想を持つ反面理屈屋で、彼の説法は複雑でわかりにくかったそうです。<br/><br/>このことから、こんがらがることを「兀庵兀庵する」と言うようになり、後に「ごたごた」となったそうです。
