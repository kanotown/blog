嫁<br/><br/>息子の妻のことを、日本語で「嫁」と言います。<br/><br/>しかしならが、自身の妻のことを指して「嫁」と呼ぶ日本人も多くいます。<br/><br/>これは本来の使い方ではないのですが、最近では広く浸透し、正しい意味として辞書にも載っています。<br/><br/>インターネット上では、アニメのキャラクタなどに対して「○○は俺の嫁」のように使う人もいます。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「嫁」という表現を好まない人も多くいるようなので、注意して下さい。

<p class="correction_comment">I think this sentence is perfect as is, in contrast to the other corrections. <br/><br/>There are some conflicting opinions about whether both nouns have to be plural in a sentence like this, so it seems like a matter of opinion (and the sentence is understandable either way). <br/><br/>I think I would personally make both nouns plural here, given that this is referring to multiple Japanese men as well as multiple wives, but "wife" probably also works if you prefer the way it sounds. <br/><br/>As for the period inside the quotes, I think that is only necessary if you are quoting speech. If the quotation marks are just around a word, like in this sentence, the period would still go outside the quotes. As a quick example:<br/><br/>He said, "The thing I'm eating is called an apple."<br/>He told me that the thing he was eating is called "apple". <br/><br/>This is also true for commas:<br/><br/>He told me that the thing he was eating is called "apple", and it looked delicious so I bought 300. :)</p>

Thank you for the helpful comment!<br/><br/>I am often confused about the position of commas and periods. Because some said something like "punctuation marks should always go inside quotation marks," whereas some said not so. (Some said it depends on the country/region.) For now, I have used the style of academic journal papers that I often refer to.

It could be something that depends on the country/region; I've seen a few things recently different from American English that have been like that/surprised me. The academic journal papers are probably the best way to go though; that is a good idea :) .
