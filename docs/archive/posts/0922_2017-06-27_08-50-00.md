# 【No. 0922】<strong><em>Wake Wakame</strong></em> (わけわかめ)
<div class="date">Jun 27, 2017 08:50</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
I sometimes introduce slang terms, but some of them are becoming obsolete.<br/><br/>For example, there is a slang term, "wake wakame" (わけわかめ), which is used when you can't understand something.<br/><br/>This term comes from the sentence "wake ga wakaranai," the literal meaning of which is "I can't understand the reason" (here "wake" means "reason," and "wakaranai" means "can't understand").<br/><br/>Also, "wakame" of "wake wakame" means "seaweed," and it's a pun for "wakaranai."<br/><br/>Wake wakame once became a dead term after it had spread in 1980s, but it became popular again since it has nominated for the popular word grand prix among high/junior high school girls in 2011.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it's becoming obsolete again now, but I sometimes use it because I like the sound.

わけわかめ<br/><br/>私は時々俗語を紹介していますが、中には死語になりつつあるものもあります。<br/><br/>例えば、何かが理解できない時に使う「わけわかめ」です。<br/><br/>「訳がわからない」の「わか」と、「わかめ」の「わか」をかけたダジャレのような言葉です。<br/><br/>この言葉は1980年代に流行した後、一度死語となりましたが、2011年女子高生ケータイ流行語大賞にノミネートされ、再度注目を浴びました。<br/><br/>最近では再び死語になりつつありますが、私は語感が好きなのでたまに使います。

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/><br/>&gt; "popular word grand prix" What?!<br/>Sorry, my translation could have misunderstood.<br/>It called "女子中高生ケータイ流行語大賞," and maybe it should have translated as something like "buzzwords-of-the-year (on cellphone) contest for high/junior high school girls."<br/><a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/" target="_blank">https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a>%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%90%E4%B8%AD%E9%AB%98%E7%94%9F%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E6%B5%81%E8%A1%8C%E8%AA%9E%E5%A4%A7%E8%B3%9E<br/><br/>It's a minor contest :)
