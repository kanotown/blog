Today, I will talk about the Japanese word "komekami."<br/><br/>"Kome" means "rice", "kami" means "to bite", and "komekami" means "temples on a head."<br/><br/>The etymology of which is that your temples move when you bite rice.<br/><br/>Of course, it doesn't need to be rice, but our traditional staple food is rice, so the word "kome" has been used.<br/><br/>(Please make sure that your temples move when you bite something.)<br/><br/>By the way, since the bone thickness of around "komekami" is thin, it's vulnerable to impact, and is referred to as a vital part in various fighting sports, same as the chin.

こめかみ<br/><br/>今日は「こめかみ」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「こめ」は "rice", 「かみ」は "bite" を意味し、「こめかみ」は "temple" を意味します。<br/><br/>これは、「こめかみ」が米を噛むと動く部分であることに由来します。<br/><br/>当然、米以外のものを噛んでもこめかみが動きますが、日本の主食が米であることからこう呼ばれるようになったようです。<br/><br/>（何かを噛んでこめかみが動くかどうか確認してみて下さい。）<br/><br/>ちなみにこめかみは、骨の厚さが薄く、打撃に対して弱いことから、各種格闘技においては顎先と同様人体の急所とされています。

<p class="correction_comment">I would write, "That is because when you eat rice, your temples would move."<br/><br/>It sounds simpler, especially if you're casually talking. Explaining the etymology of a word feels like you're a professor in class haha.</p>

 very cool! I've always wondered how/why 'kami' has so many different meanings in Japanese (hair, god, paper). It's not like atsui (hot [weather]; hot [temperature]; thick), where the meanings are related.
