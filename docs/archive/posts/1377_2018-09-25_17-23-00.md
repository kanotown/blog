歩くさまを表す擬態語 Part 2<br/><br/>昨日は、3つの歩くさまを表す擬態語を紹介しました。<br/><br/>今日は、「ふらふら」と「ぶらぶら」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ふらふら」は、不安定に揺れ動くさまや、自覚や目的なく動き回るさまを表します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、体調が悪いさまを表すこともできます。<br/><br/>「ぶらぶら」は、何かが揺れ動くさまや、のんびり歩き回るさまを表します。<br/><br/>この言葉は、なすこともなく毎日を暮らすさまを表すこともできます。

 "Sound imitation words" is a little awkward. Are you saying these words sounds like what they mean?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Very good job overall though!

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/> <br/>&gt; Are you saying these words sounds like what they mean?<br/>Yes, actually I wrote "onomatopoeias" in the previous entry, but a user taught me that "sound imitation" is easier to understand.

You're welcome! Ahh yes. Onomatopoeia is more precise to me, but i could see why someone would say that sound imitation is easier to understand. Maybe you could have both in your titles?<br/><br/>For example: Sound Imitation Words for Describing Walking Part 2 (aka onomatopoeia)<br/><br/><br/>"aka' is a commonly used acronym that means "also known as"<br/>
