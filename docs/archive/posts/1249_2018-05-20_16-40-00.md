<h1 id="subject_show">Ugo no Takenoko (雨後の筍 - Appearing in Succession)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>May 20, 2018 16:40</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
When I was reading a news article on the Internet, I found the Japanese idiom ugo no takenoko (雨後の筍), which was used to express that high-rise apartments were built one after another in a city.<br/><br/>Since u (雨) means "rain," go (後) means "after," and takenoko (筍) means "bamboo shoot," the literal meaning of ugo no takenoko is "bamboo shoots after the rain."<br/><br/>It is generally known that after it rains, bamboo shoots grow one after another.<br/><br/>Because of this, Japanese people have come to use this idiom to express that things appear in succession.

雨後の筍<br/><br/>ネット上の記事を読んでいたら、ある日本の都市で高層マンションが次々に建設されるさまを「雨後の筍」と表現していました。<br/><br/>「雨」は "rain," 「後」は "after," 「筍」は "bamboo shoot" を意味するので、「雨後の筍」の文字通りの意味は "bamboo shoots after the rain" となります。<br/><br/>一般に、雨が降ると、筍が次々と生えてくることが知られています。<br/><br/>このことから、物事が次々と現れることを、「雨後の筍」と表現するようになったというわけです。

 Perfect English. A very similar English idiom is "spring up like mushrooms," since mushrooms grow very quickly in damp places and after rain.

 We say "spring up like mushrooms" or "grow like wildfire".
