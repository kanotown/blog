Basically, I have no day off.<br/><br/>As always, I went to my university and did my work.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, I just like studying and don't want to get rest, rather than there are no day off.<br/><br/>Some juniors also came our laboratory. <br/><br/>That's because the deadline of their master thesis is approaching.<br/><br/>They look desperate, and maybe I might be like them next year due to my doctoral thesis deadline.<br/><br/>However, the new year's eve of this year, I came home early leaving juniors.<br/><br/>And now, I spend my time slowly while watching TV shows and eating oranges.<br/><br/>Best wishes throughout the coming year.
