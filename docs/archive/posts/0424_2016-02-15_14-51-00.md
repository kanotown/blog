<div class="date">Feb 15, 2016 14:51</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I went to a dental clinic, and got my two wisdom teeth out.<br/><br/>The number of extracted wisdom teeth became four, so now there is no wisdom tooth in my mouth.<br/><br/>Since anesthesia is working, I don't feel any pain now, however after a while, the anesthetic will wear off and I will come to feel some pain.<br/><br/>(When I was writing this post, I came to ache, haha.)<br/><br/>I'm scared because it was very painful when I had my wisdom teeth pulled out two years ago.<br/><br/>Anyway, I never want to go dental clinics.

親不知の抜歯<br/><br/>今日は歯医者に行き、親不知を2本抜歯しました。<br/><br/>これで合計4本となり、全ての親不知が無くなりました。<br/><br/>今は麻酔が効いていて痛くはありませんが、暫くしたら麻酔が切れ始め、痛み出すと思います。<br/><br/>※この投稿を書いている間に痛み出しました（笑）<br/><br/>以前2本抜いた時、とても痛くて苦しかったので、怖いです。<br/><br/>とにかく、もう歯医者には行きたくありません。

Hi Kanotown! <br/>I had 2 wisdom tooth extracted last year as well, because they were really starting to interfere with my life and it was really uncomfortable. Next time if you are going to extract any tooth again, try drinking some herbal tea  a week before the extraction. As tooth extractions are "heaty", It helps by remove the heat from our body. I drank some a week before my wisdom tooth extraction last year and it did not hurt at all, just a constant reminder that the tooth gone before the wound felt numb. xD<br/><br/>Get well soon!!

Hi, Yukinekorin-san (^^)<br/>Thank you for the kind advice! I will do so next time :) <br/>However, I hope I never extract any tooth, haha.
