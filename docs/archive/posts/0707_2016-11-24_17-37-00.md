# 【No. 0707】The First Snow in November
<div class="date">Nov 24, 2016 17:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
It snowed today in the Kanto region in Japan.<br/><br/>It is the first time in 54 years that the first snow falls in November in Tokyo, so this weather is really rare.<br/><br/>Since I didn't change my car tires to snow tires, I had to go to work by train.<br/><br/>As expected, the train was very crowded, and it made me tired.<br/><br/>Also, it's still the autumn color season, so we can see the scenery that snows are piled up on autumn leaves.<br/><br/>I'm feeling a little strange.<br/><br/>It might become more beautiful as more snows are piled up, but I hope that they will melt quickly so that I can commute to work smoothly.

11月の初雪<br/><br/>今日は日本の関東地方で雪が降りました。<br/><br/>11月に東京で雪が降るのは54年ぶりで、大変珍しいことのようです。<br/><br/>私は車のタイヤをスノータイヤに替えていなかったので、今日は電車で出勤しました。<br/><br/>予想どおり電車はとても混んでいて、辛かったです。<br/><br/>また、まだ紅葉の季節であるため、紅葉に雪が積もっていました。<br/><br/>少し不思議な感じがします。<br/><br/>雪がさらに積もるとより美しくなるかもしれませんが、通勤が辛いので早く溶けて欲しいです。

 Was there really enough snow for snow tires?
 <br/>
 In the region I live in everyone freaks out if there is a quarter inch of snow and everyone drives really slowly and school has to close. lol

Thank you so much for the corrections and explanations!<br/><br/>There were finally 2 inches of snow here, so we had to use snow tires.<br/><br/>&gt; In the region I live in everyone freaks out if there is a quarter inch of snow and everyone drives really slowly and school has to close. lol<br/>Interesting! :)<br/>In my city, only if there is more than a feet of snow, trains will stop and schools will close.

If it snows where I live, people don't actually freak out because of the snow. The news channels always warn people about black ice. Black ice (路面凍結) is water that comes from snow melting and refreezes on the roads during the night.<br/><br/>Here's a comedy skit from Key &amp; Peele:<br/><a href="https://youtu.be/efiW2K8gASM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/efiW2K8gASM</a><br/>“Black ice” and “black guys” sound similar so the video is about them describing black ice, but it's really a joke about black people.
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
Oh, now I understand. Indeed black ice is quite dangerous.<br/>And thank you for letting me know the funny video. lol<br/><br/>By the way, I said "snow tire" (スノータイヤ), but most Japanese people actually use "studless tire" (スタッドレスタイヤ), which doesn't slip on the ice.
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">ピポ</span><br>
Studless tires, huh. It rarely snows where I live so I have never heard about studded tires or studless tires, lol. If there is snow on the roads, then every one just drives around at like 5 or 10mph. My dad once said something about people wrapping chain around their tires, but I've never seen it done other than on the internet.<br/>スタッドレスタイヤか…雪が落ちるのは僕が住む地方にレアだから、スタッドタイヤとスタッドレスタイヤのことが聞いたことがないｗ。(アメリカの南部には)路面に雪が落ちたら、人は馬鹿遅く運転するんだ。南部地方には、いくつかの人はタイヤにチェーンを付けるのは父が言ったけど、ネット以外チェーンタイヤを見たことがない。
