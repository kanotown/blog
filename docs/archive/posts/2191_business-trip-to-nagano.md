# 【No. 2191】Business Trip to Nagano
<div class="date">Oct 21, 2023 23:59</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Business Trip to Nagano<br/><br/>Today, I went to Nagano City in Nagano Prefecture to present at a conference.<br/><br/>Since it was a day trip, I did not have much time for sightseeing, but I had planned to visit Zenkoji Temple for about an hour before the conference.<br/><br/>However, after arriving at Nagano Station, I accidentally took the wrong bus, and it went in the opposite direction of Zenkoji Temple for a while.<br/><br/>I panicked and got off the bus, running and taking some buses, but when I arrived at the entrance gate of Zenkoji Temple, there was no time left for sightseeing.<br/><br/>From there, I ran for several tens of minutes towards the venue and eventually took a taxi.<br/><br/>I was very exhausted.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the conference presentation ended successfully, and I enjoyed some delicious horse meat dishes in the evening before returning home.

長野出張<br/><br/>私は今日、長野県長野市に行き、学会発表をしてきました。<br/><br/>日帰りであったため、観光する時間はほとんど無かったのですが、善光寺だけ学会の前に1時間くらい散策する予定でいました。<br/><br/>しかし、長野駅に到着後、乗るバスを間違えてしまい、しばらく善光寺と反対方向に移動しました。<br/><br/>慌てて降りて走ったりバスを乗り継いだりするも、善光寺の入り口に到着した時点でタイムリミットが来てしまい、少しも散策することができませんでした。<br/><br/>そこから会場に向かって数十分走り、最終的にはタクシーを使いました。<br/><br/>とても疲弊しました。<br/><br/>ちなみに学会発表は無事終わり、夜は美味しい馬肉料理を食べて帰ってきました。
