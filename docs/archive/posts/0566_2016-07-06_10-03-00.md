Nara Park, which is located in Nara Prefecture of Japan, has about 660 hectares, and is well known that a plenty deer are living there.<br/><br/>The number is no less than 1500, and you can see deer in many places in the park.<br/><br/>In Nara Park, "shika senbei" (deer rice crackers) are sold, and if you buy them, deer around you will approach you.<br/><br/>Also, events called "shikayose" (huddling deer) are sometimes performed by playing a horn, and a herd of deer in the event is worth seeing.<br/><br/>Few years ago, images/videos of deer in Nara Park became small news, because deer seemed to obey the traffic signals.<br/><br/>Since deer can't identify the color of the signals, they might wait for cars to stop or be attuned to around people.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think they are a very smart animal.

奈良公園の鹿<br/><br/>日本の奈良県にある奈良公園は、約660ヘクタールの面積を有しており、敷地内に多くの鹿が生息していることで有名です。<br/><br/>その数は約1500頭と非常に多く、いたるところで鹿を見ることができます。<br/><br/>公園内では鹿のおやつである「鹿せんべい」を売っており、これを買うと周囲の鹿が寄ってきます。<br/><br/>また、ホルンを演奏して鹿を寄せ集めるイベント「鹿寄せ」もあり、とても見応えがあります。<br/><br/>以前、奈良公園の鹿がしっかり信号待ちしているという画像・動画が話題になりました。<br/><br/>鹿は信号の色を識別することはできないので、車の流れが止まるのを待ったり、周囲の人間の動きに合わせているだけだと思います。<br/><br/>いずれにしても、賢い動物です。

 I've heard that people are supposed to make the deer bow before feeding them. Bowing deer must be very polite, haha
