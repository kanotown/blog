# 【No. 1404】<strong><em>Kindai University</em></strong> (近畿大学)
<div class="date">Oct 22, 2018 13:52</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
<strong><em>Kindai University</em></strong><br/><br/>There is a famous private university called <strong><em>Kinki Daigaku</em></strong> (近畿大学 - literally "Kinki University") in Osaka, Japan.<br/><br/><strong><em>Kinki</em></strong> (近畿) means the Kansai region (the area of western Japan), but its pronunciation sounds like "kinky," so the name "Kinki University" became a diplomatic problem.<br/><br/>Therefore, it had started considering to change the name to another one around 10 years ago, and it has changed to "Kindai University" since 2016.<br/><br/><strong><em>Kin</em></strong> (近) and <strong><em>dai</em></strong> (大) are short for <strong><em>Kinki</em></strong> (近畿) and <strong><em>daigaku</em></strong> (大学), respectively -- in fact, this university is known familiarly as <strong><em>Kindai</em></strong> (近大).<br/><br/>Since both <em>dai</em> and "university" means "university," the literal meaning of Kindai University is "Kinki University University," but it can't be helped.

近畿大学<br/><br/>日本には、大阪府に「近畿大学」という名前の私立大学があります。<br/><br/>「近畿」は関西地方を表す言葉ですが、"Kinki" という音が「性的に異常な/変態な」を意味する "kinky" と似た発音であるため、国際化において対外的な問題となりました。<br/><br/>そして10年前に名称の変更が検討され、2016年に「近畿大学」の英語名称が "Kindai University" となりました。<br/><br/>"Kindai" の "kin" と "dai" はそれぞれ「近畿」と「大学」の略で、実際に近畿大学は「近大」の略称で親しまれています。<br/><br/>"Dai" も "University" も「大学」を意味するので意味が重なってしまいますが、仕方のないことかもしれません。

<p class="correction_comment">"dai" is used as a short way to refer to universities in Japan. I understand your point but this just sounds weird.</p>

Thank you so much for the correction! :)<br/>I heard that one of the primary purposes is to expand the acceptance of foreign students, so I think your opinion is right.

Haha, I heard that when professors/students say the university name at an international conference, participants/audiences are surprised and laugh.
