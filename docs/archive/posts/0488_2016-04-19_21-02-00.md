光くしゃみ反射<br/><br/>太陽や蛍光灯など、まぶしい光を見るとくしゃみが出る人がいます。<br/><br/>くしゃみが出そうで出ないときに、太陽を見てスムーズにくしゃみを出す人も多いと思います。<br/><br/>この現象は、「光くしゃみ反射」と呼ばれます。<br/><br/>光刺激が誘因となり、まぶしいと感じた瞬間にくしゃみが出やすくなります。<br/><br/>約4人に1人がこの症状を持っており、三叉神経が大きく関係していると考えられています。<br/><br/>また、統計的に、光くしゃみ反射は優性遺伝であると考えられています。<br/><br/>しかし、医学的根拠は明らかになっていません。

 科学的な話題になると、詳細をきちんと書いた方が分かりやすいし、面白いです。僕も科学専攻の人間としてこの話はよく理解しますが、生物学などに詳しくない人たちにとってはとても複雑でこういう話題に興味を持たないようになりがちです。特に、三叉神経のところをもっと詳しく説明した方がいいと思います。

Thank you very much for correcting my post!<br/>Oh, I understand. I will try to explain details of my scientific entries.<br/><br/>By the way, <br/>&gt; Why does it matter that one in four people have this symptom? <br/>I had to separate my sentence.<br/>I wanted to mention just about the statistical ratio.<br/><br/>&gt; What is the trigeminal nerve?  What does it control? <br/>Trigeminal nerve is one of cranial nerves. <br/>It has sensory functions and controls movements of eight muscles.<br/><br/>&gt; How did they find out that this nerve is connected to the sneeze reflex?<br/>It has been known that itching of the nose actuate the sneeze reflex nerve center through the trigeminal nerve. Therefore, although it's not clear, they believe that this nerve is connected to sneeze reflex.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, I'm not an expert about this area, so I can only provide a brief description.

No need to apologize! I am just pointing out ways to improve your scientific English writing.
