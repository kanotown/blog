霞を食う<br/><br/>浮世離れした生活や、収入がなくほとんど何も食べずに生活することを、「霞を食う」という表現で喩えることがあります。<br/><br/>「霞」は "haze"、「食う」は "to eat" を意味するので、「霞を食う」の文字どおりの意味は "to eat haze" となります。<br/><br/>日本では、仙人は霞を食べて生きてるといわれています。<br/><br/>「霞を食う」という表現は、仙人のような超越した存在の比喩というわけです。<br/><br/>私も近い将来、仙人のようになる必要があるかもしれません。

Thank you for the correction!<br/><br/>&gt; Most natives speakers won't understand what "life in an ivory tower" means, so it's better to explain it first.<br/>Then it might be better to say:<br/>... as a metaphor for detached life from the real world (also known as "life in an ivory tower") or life with almost no income and food. :)<br/><br/>&gt; I don't know what you mean here. <br/>Here I wanted to make two points: that this expression can be used as a metaphor for "hermits" and that hermits have abilities that transcend human beings.

1. yes that’s better!!<br/><br/>2. “Additionally, the expression ‘katsumi no kū’ can be seen as a metaphor that suggests that the ‘hermits’ can transcend human beings” might be better? :)

Thank you for your suggestion!<br/>I'm sorry for my incomprehensible English. Perhaps the nuance I want to convey is a bit different.<br/><br/>In Japan, it is well known that hermits (imaginary beings) transcend human beings, live a life detached from the real world, and live a life with almost no food. And 'kasumi wo kū' is one of the actions in hermits' lives, so the expression can be seen as a metaphor suggesting that someone is living like a hermit.<br/>(Sorry, "hermits have abilities that transcend human beings" was not really my point, but a supplementary matter.)
