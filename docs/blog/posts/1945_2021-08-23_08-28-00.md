<h1 id="subject_show">Uchi Benkei (内弁慶 - A Lion at Home and a Mouse Abroad)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Aug 23, 2021 08:28</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Uchi Benkei<br/><br/>A person who is strong and domineering inside the house, but cowardly outside, is called 'uchi Benkei' (内弁慶) in Japanese.<br/><br/>'Uchi' (内) means "inside."<br/><br/>In addition, 'Benkei' (弁慶) refers to 'Musashibo Benkei' (武蔵坊弁慶), a monk in the late Heian period (around the 12th century). He had a large body and monstrous strength, and his name is used as a synonym for a strong man.<br/><br/>That is to say, 'uchi Benkei' means a person who is strong like Musashibo Benkei only inside the house.<br/><br/>In English, it can be expressed as "(a man who is) a lion at home and a mouse abroad."

内弁慶<br/><br/>家の中では威張り、外に出ると大人しくなる人のことを、「内弁慶」と言います。<br/><br/>「内」は "inside" を意味します。<br/><br/>「弁慶」は平安時代末期の僧侶「武蔵坊弁慶」のことで、体が大きく怪力であり、豪傑な人の代名詞としても利用されます。<br/><br/>すなわち「内弁慶」とは、家の中でだけは弁慶のように強い態度をとる人、というわけです。<br/><br/>英語では "a lion at home and a mouse abroad"（家ではライオン、外ではネズミ）のように表現されます。

 That's a really interesting one! It can basically mean someone is popular in their home town or their home country, but is considered a nobody the moment they travel to another part of the world?

Thank you for the comment! :)<br/>That's interesting. Indeed, I think 内弁慶 can also refer to such a person. However, this term is usually used to point out someone's change in attitude. In other words, it implies someone is bossy in their home town or country, but gets nervous in the outside world. Note that this term contains an insulting nuance.<br/><br/>The following proverb might be more appropriate to refer to the person you are referring to:<br/><a href="https://japanesequizzes.com/portfolio/i-no-naka-no-kawazu-taikai-o-shirazu/" target="_blank">https://japanesequizzes.com/portfolio/i-no-naka-no-kawazu-taikai-o-shirazu/</a>
