日陰者<br/><br/>昨日は「星影」と「月影」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>「太陽の光」という意味で「日影」と言うこともできますが、「ひかげ」の漢字は通常「日陰」です。<br/><br/>そして「日陰」と書いた場合は、「日の当たらない場所」を意味します。<br/><br/>さらに、「日陰」に人を表す「者」をつけて「日陰者」とすることで、「表立って世に出られない人」や「世に知られず埋もれて立身出世できない人」を意味する言葉となります。

 Hi Toru!  I see that 日陰者 can also mean 'a person with a shady past' or 'an ex-convict.'

Thank you so much for correcting my post and letting me know these terms!<br/><br/>&gt; And if you write...<br/>Actually, some commenters on Lang-8 told me that you should not use 'and' at the beginning of sentences (especially in formal sentences), but should I use 'and' here?

Hi Toru!  Yes, writers often avoid using 'and' at the beginning of a sentence in certain types of formal writing.  But it is not grammatically incorrect to use a coordinating conjunction (and, but, etc.) at the beginning of a complete sentence.  If you would like to use a more formal expression in this case, I would say 'In addition, if you write....'
