固唾を呑む<br/><br/>私は時折、事の成り行きが気掛かりで、息を凝らして見守ることがあります。<br/><br/>このようなことを、「固唾を呑む」と言うことができます。<br/><br/>「固」は "firm"、「唾」は "saliva"、「呑む」は "swallow/drink" を意味するので、この表現の文字どおりの意味は "to swallow one's firm saliva" となります。<br/><br/>ここで「固唾」とは、緊張した際に口の中に溜まる唾のことです。<br/><br/>事の成り行きが心配であると、きっとこの固唾を呑みこむことになると思います。<br/><br/>このことから、「固唾を呑む」は現在の意味を持つようになりました。
