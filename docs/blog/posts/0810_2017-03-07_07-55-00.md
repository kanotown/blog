Today I will talk about the Japanese term "akkanbe."<br/><br/>"Akkabe" is used when you want to tease or provoke someone, and it is often accompanied by a physical action.<br/><br/>Specifically, the action is that you pull your lower eyelid down, and put your tongue out.<br/><br/>Originally, it was "akame," which means "red eye," because a red region of your eye is exposed when you pull your eyelid down.<br/><br/>Then it came to change to "akanbe" or "akkanbe."<br/><br/>Note that this expression is basically used by children.<br/><br/>Incidentally, according to my dictionary, "akanbe" is translated into "to cock a snook" :-P

あっかんべー<br/><br/>今日は「あっかんべー」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「あっかんべー」は、相手をからかったりする際に使う表現で、多くの場合身体的な動作を伴います。<br/><br/>具体的には、相手に向かって下まぶたを引き下げ、舌を出します。<br/><br/>下まぶたを下げると赤い部分が見えることから、「赤目」となり、次第に現在の「あかんべえ」や「あっかんべー」になったとされています。<br/><br/>基本的には、子どもが使う表現であることに注意して下さい。<br/><br/>ちなみに、私の辞書によると「あっかんべー」は "to cock a snook" だそうです :-P

Thank you very much for correcting my post! (^^)<br/>Sorry, "cock a snook" might be a British old-fashioned expression.

<p class="correction_comment">The way you phrased it was a bit awkward.<br/><br/>"became known as"<br/>This phrase is how people say that something has become widespread knowledge.<br/>--&gt;Ex1: It became known that Mary and Ryan were dating.<br/>--&gt;Ex2: "The early bird catches the worm" became known as a phrase that means people who come early get more.<br/>--&gt;Ex3: I became known as the "Witch."<br/>In all of these, something was becoming common knowledge to a group of people.</p>
