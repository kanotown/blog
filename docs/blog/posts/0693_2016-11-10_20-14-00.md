<h1 id="subject_show">Abura wo Uru (Sell Oil)</h1>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese idiom "abura wo uru."<br/><br/>The literal meaning of "abura wo uru" is "to sell oil," and it expresses that someone neglects on his/her work temporarily or has an idle talk.<br/><br/>In the Edo period in Japan, oil sellers chatted with customers for a long time when they sold oil.<br/><br/>Oil has high viscosity, and it took a long time to transfer the oil to customer's container, so oil sellers spent the time talking.<br/><br/>From this fact, to neglect work or to have an idle talk came to be referred to as "abura wo uru."

油を売る<br/><br/>今日は「油を売る」という慣用句を紹介します。<br/><br/>「油を売る」は「一時的に仕事を怠けること」や「無駄話をすること」を表します。<br/><br/>江戸時代の日本では、油売りが客に油を売る際、長々と世間話をしていました。<br/><br/>油は粘性が高く、客の枡に油を移すのに時間がかかるため、その間を雑談で繋いでいたと言われています。<br/><br/>これが転じて、怠けることや無駄話をすることを「油を売る」と言うようになりました。
