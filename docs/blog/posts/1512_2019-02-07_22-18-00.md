墓穴を掘る<br/><br/>私はたまに、墓穴を掘ります。<br/><br/>「墓穴を掘る」とは、自らの手で身を滅ぼす原因を作ることを意味する慣用句です。<br/><br/>「墓」は "grave" や "burial"、「穴」は "hole" や "pit"、「掘る」は "to dig" を意味するので、この慣用句の文字どおりの意味は "to dig a burial pit/grave" となります。<br/><br/>日本語では省略されていますが、この慣用句の墓穴は、自分自身のものを示唆しています。<br/><br/>英語では、"to dig one's own grave" や "to dig oneself into a hole" のように言うことができます。
