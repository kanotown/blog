今日は、年賀状を書きました。<br/><br/>日本では、12種類の干支が各年に存在し、我々はよくその年の干支を年賀状に描きます。<br/><br/>来年の干支は羊ですが、私は単に羊を描くだけではつまらないと思いました。<br/><br/>そこで、次の式で表されるマンデルブロ集合の中から、羊を探しました。<br/><br/>z_n=(z_n)^2+C,<br/><br/>ここでCは複素数を表し、そして面白いことに、この複素数列はフラクタルを表します（フラクタルとは、様々な自己相似のパターンを持つ図形を意味します）。<br/><br/>そして暫くして、私は座標 (-1.74972831529409, -3.35584316649456e-10) を中心とした直径 4.57321575822222e-8 の正方形領域内に、羊のような形を見つけました。<br/><br/>私はマンデルブロ集合の中に隠れていたこの羊を利用することを決め、そして羊に目を追加で描き、プリントしました。<br/><br/>数学的形状をした美しい羊の完成です！

Thank you very much for your correction!!!<br/><br/>By the way, if I use "made", should I write like "made from(or of?) Mandelbrot Set" ?

You are welcome!<br/><br/>&gt;By the way, if I use "made", should I write like "made from(or of?) Mandelbrot Set"<br/><br/>Sorry I should have commented my correction. Your original sentence is fine, but you can also write it like this:  New Year's Greeting Card made using Mandelbrot Set.

woops! I just realized that you only found one and not multiple of them, so it would just be "I found a sheep-like shape". :))

Thank you so much for your correction and your handwriting picture!!<br/>You're very good at drawing.(^-^) (but why a monkey..?)<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; I just realized that you only found one and not multiple of them, <br/>I found a number of similar shapes at once (because it's a fractal), so maybe I think your first correction "shape-like shapes" is right! :D<br/><br/>And I uploaded these images.
