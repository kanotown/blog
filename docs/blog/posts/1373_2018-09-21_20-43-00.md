無鉄砲<br/><br/>私は違いますが、世の中には「無鉄砲」な人がいます。<br/><br/>「無鉄砲」とは、先のことをよく考えず、強引に行動するさまを表す言葉です。<br/><br/>「無」は "nothing,"「鉄砲」は "gun" を意味します。<br/><br/>そのため、「無鉄砲」の語源は「鉄砲を持たず無謀に突っ込むこと」だと思うかもしれません。<br/><br/>しかし、「無鉄砲」は「無手法」の音が変化したものだと考えられています。<br/><br/>「無手法」の文字通りの意味は「手に何も持たないこと」や「手段がないこと」であり、そこから現代の意味に派生したようです。

The literal meaning of mutehou is "not having anything in one's hands" or "there is no means," and it has come to have the current meaning.
<p class="correction_comment">If this sentence is in connection to the previous one (where you mentioned "mutehou"), I'd make sure to use "mutehou" here too.</p>
