尻尾を出す<br/><br/>昨日は、欠点が不意に出てしまうことを意味する「ぼろが出る」という慣用句を紹介しました。<br/><br/>これと似た慣用句に、「尻尾を出す」があります。<br/><br/>「尻尾」は "tail," 「出す」は "to come out" や "to reveal" を意味するので、「尻尾を出す」の文字通りの意味は "to reveal one's tail" となります。<br/><br/>ここでの「尻尾」は、化けて人を騙すと信じられている狸や狐の尻尾を表しています。<br/><br/>狸や狐が何かに化けていても、尻尾を出してしまうとその正体がばれてしまうことから、「尻尾を出す」は「隠していたことが不意に露見する」という意味を持つようになりました。
