一匹狼<br/><br/>今日は「一匹狼」という日本語を紹介します。<br/><br/>一匹狼は、組織や仲間の力に頼らず、自分の力だけで行動する人を指します。<br/><br/>狼の社会は群れ社会ですが、群れから離れて単独で放浪する狼のことを一匹狼と呼びます。<br/><br/>これが転じて、現在では一般的に人間に使用されるようになりました。<br/><br/>以前、野生の一匹狼は遠吠えで何を言っているのかをバウリンガルで調べる日本のテレビ番組がありました。<br/><br/>その結果、その一匹狼は「僕はなにをしたらいい？」と言っていたそうです。<br/><br/>野生の一匹狼も人間社会の一匹狼も、好き好んで群れから離れているわけではないのかもしれません。

<p class="correction_comment">Do not capitalize "wolf". The other person was wrong that you capitalize because it is a noun. Maybe the person confused it with something. Look at this website on capitalization: http://libraryonline.com/?pID=48</p>
