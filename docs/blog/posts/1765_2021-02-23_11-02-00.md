天皇誕生日（2019年～）<br/><br/>今日2月23日は天皇誕生日、祝日です。<br/><br/>この祝日は、「天皇の誕生日を祝う」ことを趣旨としています。<br/><br/>2019年5月1日より在位中の天皇徳仁陛下の誕生日が、2月23日というわけです。<br/><br/>2019年4月30日までは、先代天皇明仁階下の誕生日である12月23日が、祝日でした。<br/><br/>（2015年12月23日にも、天皇誕生日を紹介する記事を投稿していました。）<br/><br/>この日、宮中では祝賀の義などの行事が催されるのが通例ですが、今年は昨年に続き、新型コロナウィルス感染拡大の現状に鑑み、中止となっています。
