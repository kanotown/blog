ニョッキ<br/><br/>今日はニョッキについて話します。<br/><br/>ニョッキはパスタの一種で、伝統的なイタリア料理です。<br/><br/>かつては小麦粉のみで作られていましたが、現在はじゃがいもと小麦粉を組み合わせて作られています。<br/><br/>そして、イタリアではニョッキを木曜日に食べることが多いようです。<br/><br/>金曜には肉を食べないというキリスト教の決まりから、木曜にお腹にたまるものを食べるようになったのが始まりだそうです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、ニョッキは複数形で、単数形はニョッコだそうです。<br/><br/>実は、一番言いたかったのは最後の一文です。

 Hmm I think many prohibitions have been changed around conveniently. Like the Christian example you gave, I think the Catholics, for a long while, used to be unable to eat fish on a certain day.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It's all conveniently changed now in the modern world, and makes me wonder if Muslims might eventually be able to eat pork. I wonder why people don't think deeper about all these 'casual' changes.

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>Yes, I think it inconvenient to prohibit eating something religiously, especially when you travel.<br/>Someday, such prohibition may be changed, but there will remain many unreasonable things in the world.
