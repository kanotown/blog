 When I see other people's misfortune, I feel a vague sense of schadenfreude

"Schadenfreude" is a new word for me. Thank you for letting me know that. :)<br/>It is called 'meshiuma' (メシウマ) in Japanese.

'Asu wa wagami' (明日は我が身) is a Japanese phrase that admonishes people <span class="f_blue">over(?) </span>such a possibility.
<p class="correction_comment">"for" sounds a bit odd to me in this context. Sure, you can say, "admonish someone for being late". The "for" usually refers back to what the person (or entity) did wrong. But here it only refers to a possibility.<br/><br/>Not absolutely sure which preposition should go with "admonish" in this context, I did a search online and found this:<br/><br/>"He also admonished the U.S. central bank over the cost of borrowing money." - Los Angeles Times, Nov 2018.<br/><br/>And I'm good with this. <br/>:)</p>
