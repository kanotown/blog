Recently, I often correct graduation theses of students in my laboratory.<br/><br/>Since they are Japanese sentences that were written by Japanese, surely there are not many grammatical errors.<br/><br/>However, there are some basic errors related to tenses and conjunctions.<br/><br/>When I notice such a little mistakes, I recall my experience of Lang-8.<br/><br/>I think I've been more sensitive to a little mistake because I've continued to correct Japanese sentences on Lang-8.<br/><br/>I am grateful to everyone.

日本語の学生の添削<br/><br/>最近、私はよく研究室の学生の卒業論文を添削しています。<br/><br/>日本人が書く日本語の文章なので、当然文法的な誤りは多くありません。<br/><br/>しかし、時制のミスや不自然な接続詞など、初歩的なミスも見受けられます。<br/><br/>そのような細かいミスに気づく度、私はLang-8での経験を思い出します。<br/><br/>きっとLang-8で添削をしてきたおかげで、細かいミスにより敏感になっているのだと思います。<br/><br/>私を成長させてくれた皆様に、感謝いたします。

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>For example, he wrote "本稿では実験を行っている (we are conducting the experiment in this paper)," but he should have used past tenses, like "実験を行った (we conducted the experiment)."<br/><br/>Also, he used conjunctions that have the same meaning twice in a sentence, like "～であるが，だったが，～であった． (Although ..., however, ...)," and used spoken language, such as "やっぱり" or "～なので."
