<h1 id="subject_show">Heppiri Goshi (へっぴり腰 - Full of Fear)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Feb 2, 2018 16:07</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Have you ever seen a person who has a extremely diffident attitude or is full of fear?<br/><br/>Such a person is called へっぴり腰 (heppiri goshi) in Japanese.<br/><br/>へっぴり (heppiri) comes from へひり (hehiri) or 屁をひる (he wo hiru), which means "to fart," and 腰 (koshi) means "hip."<br/><br/>Therefore, the literal meaning of "heppiri goshi" is "one's hip (posture) when farting."<br/><br/>In fact, this term originally meant such a half-crouching posture that is unstable.<br/><br/>Later, since people have such a posture when they have less confidence, "heppiri goshi" has come to also mean a diffident attitude.

へっぴり腰<br/><br/>自信のない態度をとっている人を見たことがありますか？<br/><br/>そのような人のことを、日本語で「へっぴり腰」と言います。<br/><br/>「へっぴり」はおならをすることを意味する「屁をひる」および「へひり」から来ており、「腰」は "hip" を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち、「へっぴり腰」の文字通りの意味は、「おならをする時のような姿勢（尻）」となります。<br/><br/>実際、この言葉はもともと、そのような中腰の不安定な姿勢を意味していました。<br/><br/>後に、人は自信が無い時にもそのような姿勢をとることから、自信のない態度を意味するようにもなりました。

Thank you so much for the corrections!<br/><br/>I wanted to use the term "diffident," but is this unnatural?<br/><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/diffident" target="_blank">http://www.dictionary.com/browse/diffident</a>

I apologize, I've never heard of the word "diffident", so I wrongly assumed you meant "different". So "diffident" is correct and actually makes a bit more sense. My bad, sorry ^__^
