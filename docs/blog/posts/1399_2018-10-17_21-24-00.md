いなせ<br/><br/>勇み肌でさっぱりしている若者のことを、「いなせ」と言うことがあります。<br/><br/>この言葉は、江戸時代後期に魚河岸の若者の間で流行した「鯔背銀杏」という髪型に由来します。<br/><br/>「鯔」は魚のボラのこと、「背」は "back" を意味するので、「鯔背」は "flathead grey mullet's back"  を意味します。<br/><br/>また、「銀杏」は江戸時代に最も一般的だった男性の髪型「銀杏髷」を略したものです。<br/><br/>すなわち、「鯔背銀杏」とはボラの背に似た髪型のことで、その髪型をしていた若者は男気があったことから、現在の意味になったというわけです。

<li class="incorrect">'Ina' (鯔) means "flathead grey mullet," 'se' (背) means "back," so 'inase' means "flathead grey mullet's back."</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
'Ina' (鯔) means "flathead grey mullet fish," 'se' (背) means "back," so 'inase' means "flathead grey mullet's back."
<p class="correction_comment">I added "fish" the first time that "Ina" was explained, just to point out that "mullet" refers to a certain kind of fish, and not another kind of hairstyle. <br/><br/>This hairstyle is also called a mullet in English: http://eastcoastmetalchurch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mullett2.jpg<br/><br/>(Most people could guess that you didn't mean that hairstyle, but I think it's what comes to mind for a lot of people when they see the word "mullet", so I added it anyway.)</p>
