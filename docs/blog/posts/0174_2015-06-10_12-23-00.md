<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to introduce the largest "sliding door" in the world.<br/><br/>It is located in the Tanegashima Space Center of JAXA in Japan.<br/><br/>The dimensions of the door is 67 m height, 27 m width, and 2.5 m thickness.<br/><br/>This is mainly used for transporting rocket parts.<br/><br/>However, the largest "door" in the world is located in the Kennedy Space Center of NASA in America.<br/><br/>The door has 139 m height.
