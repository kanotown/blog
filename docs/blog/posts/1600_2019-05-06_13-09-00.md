<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Monomi Yusan<br/><br/>I would like to do 'monomi yusan' (物見遊山) sometimes.<br/><br/>Since 'mono' (物) means "thing," 'mi' (見) means "to see," 'yu' (遊) means "to play," and 'san' (山) means "mountain," the literal meaning of the combination is "to see things and to play at mountains."<br/><br/>'Yusan' (遊山) was originally a Buddhist term, which meant that a Zen monk who finished training moves to the next temple (mountain) while going around various places.<br/><br/>Later, 'yusan' came to mean to go to mountains for playing, and 'monomi yusan' came to mean to go to various places for sightseeing or playing.

物見遊山<br/><br/>たまには「物見遊山」したいものです。<br/><br/>「物」は "thing"、「見」は "to see"、「遊」は "to play"、「山」は "mountain" を意味するので、「物見遊山」の文字どおりの意味は "to see things and to play at mountains" となります。<br/><br/>「遊山」はもともと仏教用語で、修業を終えた僧が各地を巡りながら次の寺（山）に移動することを意味していました。<br/><br/>これが野山に遊びに行くという意味になり「物見遊山」は「気晴らしにいろいろなところに遊びに行くこと」を意味するようになったというわけです。
