コンビニの数、寺の数、神社の数<br/><br/>日本には約55,000のコンビニが存在します。<br/><br/>約2300人につき1つのコンビニがあることになります。<br/><br/>一方、日本にはお寺が約77,000、神社が約81,000もあるそうです。<br/><br/>いたるところにコンビニがあると思っていましたが、それよりもお寺や神社のほうが多かったことに驚きました。<br/><br/>どういうわけか、お寺や神社は年々増え続けているようです。<br/><br/>日本を観光する際は、ぜひ伝統的なお寺や神社を訪れることをおすすめします。<br/><br/>ちなみに、日本にある歯科医院の数は約69,000で、これもコンビニより多いです。

Thank you very much for your corrections!<br/>Actually, the number of convenience stores are proportional to the population, so there are a lot of convenience stores especially in Tokyo.
