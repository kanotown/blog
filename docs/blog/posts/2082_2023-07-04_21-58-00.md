The Japanese Youth Slang Term 'Mi': Part 2<br/><br/>Although 'mi' (み) is a suffix used to turn adjectives into nouns, young Japanese people today apply it to various adjectives and even verbs.<br/><br/>The most famous example of using 'mi' to nominalize a verb is 'wakarimi' (わかりみ - "understanding"), which derives from the verb 'wakaru' (わかる - "to understand").<br/><br/>The correct reason why young people began to attach 'mi' to various words is not known, but it is thought to be for reasons such as "to soften the assertion by using euphemistic expressions" or "for the funny and cute sounds of the words."<br/><br/>Here, since using these nouns by themselves is incomplete as a sentence, they are often used with other verbs or adjectives, such as 'aru' (ある - "to exist"), 'fukai' (深い - "deep"), and 'kanjiru' (感じる - "to feel").<br/><br/>Examples:<br/>'Wakarimi ga fukai' (わかりみが深い - "I totally understand.") *very frequently used<br/>'Yabami wo kanjiru' (やばみを感じる - "I feel dangerous.")

若者言葉の「み」　Part 2<br/><br/>「み」は一部の形容詞を名詞化する接尾辞ですが、最近の日本の若者はあらゆる形容詞、さらには動詞の名詞化にも利用します。<br/><br/>動詞の名詞化に「み」を利用した代表的な例は、「わかる」を「わかりみ」としたものです。<br/><br/>何故若者はさまざまな語に「み」をつけるようになったのか、正確な起源はわかりませんが、「婉曲的な表現にすることで主張をぼかすため」や「語感の面白さや可愛らしさのため」であると考えられます。<br/><br/>ただし、名詞単体では文章として不完全なので、「ある」「深い」「感じる」のような動詞または形容詞が続くことが多いです。<br/><br/>例：<br/>「わかりみが深い」（※頻出）<br/>「やばみを感じる」
