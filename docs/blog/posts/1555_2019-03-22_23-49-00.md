Megashira ga Atsuku Naru<br/><br/>The day before yesterday, a graduation ceremony took place at my university.<br/><br/>When I saw students who would spread their wings, my eyes filled with tears.<br/><br/>When one's eyes fill with tears like my case, it can be expressed as the Japanese phrase 'megashira ga atsuku naru' (目頭が熱くなる).<br/><br/>'Me' (目) means "eye," 'gashira/kashira' (頭) means "head," and the combination means "inner corner of one's eye."<br/><br/>In addition, 'atsuku naru' (熱くなる) means "to get hot," so the literal meaning of this phrase is "inner corners of one's eyes get hot."<br/><br/>It is thought that it comes from the fact that tears accumulated in your eyes would make you feel warm.

目頭が熱くなる<br/><br/>一昨日は、私の大学の卒業式が行われました。<br/><br/>巣立っていく学生の姿を見ると、私は感動で思わず涙が出そうになりました。<br/><br/>このように、感動で涙が出そうになることを、日本語で「目頭が熱くなる」と言います。<br/><br/>「目」は "eye"、「頭」は "head" を意味し、「目頭」で "inner corner of one's eye" を意味します。<br/><br/>また、「熱くなる」は "to get hot" を意味するので、この慣用句の文字どおりの意味は "inner corners of one's eyes get hot" となります。<br/><br/>涙が目頭に溜まると暖かく感じることに由来すると考えられます。
