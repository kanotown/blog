サボる<br/><br/>今日は「サボる」という動詞を紹介します。<br/><br/>「サボる」は、仕事などを怠けることを意味します。<br/><br/>この言葉を日本語だと思っている日本人は多いと思いますが、実際はフランス語の "sabotage" に由来します。<br/><br/>"Sabotage" とは、過失に見せかけて機械を破壊したり、仕事を停滞させるなど、経営者に損害を与えることで事態の解決を促進する労働争議の一種です。<br/><br/>"Sabotage" は、木靴を意味する "sabot" から来ています。<br/><br/>これは、かつてフランスの労働者が木靴で機械を蹴り破壊したことに由来するそうです。<br/><br/>フランス語や英語の "sabotage" と違い、日本語の「サボる」は怠ける程度の軽い意味で使われることに注意して下さい。

broader translation means 'in english' is not needed, as english is almost straight transliteration from french, and english meaning is nothing of a labor (labour) dispute...i think this spellcheck is american.

According to the Japanese version Wikipedia, there are several theories about the origin, and currently the most accepted one seems to be what I wrote. However, since the sauce was ambiguous, your prediction might be right.

<li class="incorrect">"Saboru" means to skip your work or class in idleness.</li>
<li class="corrected correct">
Saboru means to skip your work or class due to idleness.
<p class="correction_comment">"Saboru" --&gt; Saboru - It's a standard practice that when introducing a term for the first time to surround it with quotation marks (or use a bold font). This is used to mark the word/phrase so that the reader will understand that author wants them to pay special attention to it. Based on common experience the reader would then expect that subsequent text would explain the word.<br/><br/>After the word's introduction all subsequent references will not use quotes. <br/><br/>in idleness --&gt; due to idleness - It's not that "in idleness" couldn't be used but it's not something I'd expect to see. If you wanted to use that express it might work in something like this:<br/><br/>Soboru means to, in idleness,skip your work or class. - This is still kind of an awkward sentence.</p>

Many Japanese people might believe that this is a pure Japanese verb, but it actually comes from the French (word) "sabotage."
<p class="correction_comment">I do no see any problem with "might believe." The other suggestions "believe"  and "think" are also valid choices. <br/><br/>French (word) "sabotage." - Adding "word" would make it more explicit but the sentence could work well without it too.</p>

Hi azza3695,<br/><br/>If your comment was directed toward me I haven't a clue what you wrote. Would you believe I've found that I enjoy the exercise of commenting/correcting entries here but have managed to avoid learning more than a word or two in any of them? <br/><br/>I have to rely on Google Translate to make any sense out of the native language entries.<br/><br/>Google translates your response ぼくはべんきょうのさぼるですよ？   as "I am a savory breeder?" That definitely falls into one of the odder translations I've received. <br/><br/>I'm curious, what do you mean?<br/>

Thank you very much for the corrections and the kind comments!<br/>They're really helpful :)<br/><br/>&gt; which inflicts heavy damage on managers<br/>Here, I wanted to mean to make managers suffer an economic loss. I wrote just "heavy damage," but I wanted to say an economical damage/loss.<br/>The Japanese part is "経営者に損害を与える" -- "経営者" means "manager," "損害" means "damage/loss," and "与える" means "give/inflict."

&gt; ぼくはべんきょうのさぼるですよ？<br/>Hmm, I think that azza3695-san tried to make a sentence using "サボる" in practice, but this sentence isn't grammatically correct.<br/><br/>Maybe you should say something like:<br/>僕は勉強をサボるのですよ/サボります/サボってしまいます。<br/>(I skip/neglect my studies.)
