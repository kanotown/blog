サザエさん [Part 2]<br/><br/>今日は日本の国民的アニメ「サザエさん」のトピックの続きです。<br/><br/>サザエさんは、毎週日曜日の夕方に放送されています。<br/><br/>このため、我々はサザエさんを見ると、翌日から通学・仕事をしないといけないという鬱な気分になることがあります。<br/><br/>この現象をサザエさん症候群と呼ぶそうです（ブルーマンデー症候群と同様）。<br/><br/>また、サザエさんの視聴率の変動によって、景気の変動を予測できるとも言われています。<br/><br/>景気が良くなると日曜夕方の外食率が増加し、サザエさんの視聴率が下がるというわけです。<br/><br/>正直に言うと、特別面白いというわけではありませんが、穏やかな気分で何気なく見ることができるアニメだと思います。<br/><br/>日本に来た時は、是非ご覧になって下さい。

 Interesting! It seems that Sazae-san manga was not so long lasting as the anime.

 I suppose it has a stronger local appeal. But there's always room for the simple classics.
