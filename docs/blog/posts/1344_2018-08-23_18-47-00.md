Thank you so much for the corrections. :)<br/><br/>&gt; In the same way, I will be introducing another coined word. To prepare in advance for the future is called 'fuseki' (布石) in Japanese.<br/>It is difficult for me to explain, but I wanted to say something like:<br/>I introduced two terms in advance as a preparation for the yesterday's term. This preparation like I did can be called 'fuseki.'
