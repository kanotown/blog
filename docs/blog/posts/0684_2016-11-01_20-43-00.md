<h1 id="subject_show">Tanuki Neiri (Sham Sleep)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Nov 1, 2016 20:43</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I will talk about the Japanese phrase "tanuki neiri."<br/><br/>"Tanuki" means raccoon dogs, "neiri" means "to sleep," and  "tanuki neiri" expresses that someone pretends to fall asleep.<br/><br/>Raccoon dogs are very timid, so if you surprise them, they'll faint for a while.<br/><br/>Also, it has been thought that raccoon dogs can deceive people in Japan. <br/><br/>Therefore, people thought that the faint of raccoon dogs is fake to deceive us, and we came to refer to "sham sleep" as "tanuki neiri" (raccoon dog sleep).<br/><br/>By the way, I heard that the English phrase "fox sleep" means "sham sleep."<br/><br/>Japanese people have thought that foxes can also deceive us like raccoon dogs, so the English phrase is very interesting.

狸寝入り<br/><br/>今日は日本の言葉「狸寝入り」を紹介します。<br/><br/>狸寝入りとは、寝たふりをすることを意味します。<br/><br/>狸という動物はとても臆病で、驚いたりすると一時的に気を失い、眠ったように倒れます。<br/><br/>また、昔から狸は人を騙すと思われてきました。<br/><br/>そのため、人々は狸の気絶を人を騙す嘘だと考え、寝たふりのことを狸寝入りと呼ぶうようになりました。<br/><br/>ちなみに英語では "fox sleep" （狐寝入り）と書いて寝たふりを表すことがあるそうです。<br/><br/>日本では狐も人を騙すと考えられているので、とても興味深い事実です。

 Good job! I have heard of the tanuki, because I have seen the movie 'Pom Poko'. Have you seen it?

Thank you so much for correcting my post again!<br/>Yes, I watched the movie several times :)<br/>When I was child, I couldn't understand the story, but recently I realized that the movie contains important things to think about.
