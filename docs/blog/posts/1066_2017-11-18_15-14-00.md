風邪？食中毒？<br/><br/>私は昨日、体調を崩しました。<br/><br/>喉と頭が痛かったので、風邪だと思い、早めに家に帰って寝ることにしました。<br/><br/>しかし、夜中に目が覚め、激しい頭痛と吐気に襲われ、夕飯に食べたものを全て吐き出してしまいました。<br/><br/>何度も頭痛と吐気で目が覚め、辛かったです。<br/><br/>結局、18時間くらい寝て、ようやく症状が和らぎました。<br/><br/>ただ、まだ頭が痛いので、今日の投稿はこのような簡単な日記にします。

<p class="correction_comment">"a feeling of nausea" is fine, but not necessary. You can just say "I woke up in the middle of the night due to a severe headache and nausea." :)</p>

It was very painful because I woke up repeatedly with the headache and <span class="f_blue"><span class="sline">the </span></span>nausea.
<p class="correction_comment">There's nothing wrong with the second "the" from a grammatical standpoint, but it's redundant.</p>
