<h1 id="subject_show">Iitai Koto wa Asu Ie (言いたいことは明日言え - If You Want to Say Something, Say It Tomorrow)</h1>

Iitai Koto wa Asu Ie<br/><br/>Today, I would like to introduce a proverb that seems to be for a man of many gaffes like me, 'iitai koto wa asu ie' (言いたいことは明日言え).<br/><br/>Since 'iitai koto' (言いたいこと) means "what you want to say," 'asu' (明日) means "tomorrow," and 'ie' (言え) is the imperative form of "say," the literal meaning of this proverb is "if you want to say something, say it tomorrow."<br/><br/>In other words, it means that even if you want to say something, you should not say it instantly, but think it over.<br/><br/>In particular, you should be careful not to say something emotionally about an unpleasant event, as it will lead to negative consequences.

言いたいことは明日言え<br/><br/>今日は失言の多い私のためのことわざ「言いたいことは明日言え」を紹介します。<br/><br/>「言いたいこと」は "what you want to say"、「明日」は "tomorrow"、「言え」は "say" の命令形であるため、「言いたいことは明日言え」の文字通りの意味は "if you want to say something, say it tomorrow" となります。<br/><br/>言いたいことがあっても、すぐには言わず、じっくりと考えてから口に出したほうが良いという教えです。<br/><br/>特に、嫌なことがあったときに感情的になって発言すると、悪い結果に繋がるので注意が必要です。

 I feel there is a double meaning behind this proverb.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Besides what you mentioned, I believe it also tells people to say what they want to say to others instead of keeping it in their hearts. Because not sharing one's true feelings on matters could lead to bigger problems in the future.

Thank you for correcting me again! :)<br/><br/>I think you are right. It is not good to postpone the timing of saying what you want to say and eventually say nothing.
