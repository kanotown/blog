<div class="date" hidden>Feb 20, 2018 10:58</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
A woman who tries to please everybody is called 八方美人 (happou bijin) in Japanese.<br/><br/>八方 (happou) means "eight directions" and 美人 (bijin) means "beautiful woman."<br/><br/>Here the eight directions represent "north," "northeast," "east," "southeast," "south," "southwest," "west," and "northwest," so the literal meaning of "happou bijin" is a woman who is beautiful from any direction.<br/><br/>However, the "bijin" implies a person with a beautiful attitude towards others, not a woman with a beautiful face.<br/><br/>That is to say, "happou bijin" means a person who tries to be all things to all people.<br/><br/>It might sound like a good meaning, but note that this term is often used in an ironic meaning.

八方美人<br/><br/>誰に対しても如才なくふるまう人のことを、日本語で「八方美人」と言います。<br/><br/>「八方」は "eight directions," 「美人」は "beautiful woman" を意味します。<br/><br/>ここで「八方」は「北」「北東」「東」「南東」「南」「南西」「西」「北西」のことであり、「八方美人」の文字どおりの意味は「どのほうこうから見ても欠点のない美人」です。<br/><br/>ただし、この「美人」は顔が美しい人という意味ではなく、他人に対する態度のことを指しています。<br/><br/>すなわち「八方美人」は、「誰からも好かれるように上手くふるまう人」のことを表します。<br/><br/>これだけ聞くと良い意味に聞こえるかもしれませんが、皮肉を込めて使われることも多いので注意して下さい。
