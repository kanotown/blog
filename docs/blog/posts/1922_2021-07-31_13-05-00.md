<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Ron yori Shōko<br/><br/>When actual evidence is shown, things become clearer, and we don't need to argue and think about it repeatedly.<br/><br/>To explain this fact, you can use the Japanese proverb 'ron yori shōko' (論より証拠).<br/><br/>Since 'ron' (論) means "opinion" or "view," 'yori' (より) means "more/better than," and 'shōko' (証拠) means "evidence," 'ron yori shōko' literally means "evidence is better than opinions."<br/><br/>This proverb can be translated into English as "The proof of the pudding is in the eating," "Practice is better than precept," or "Seeing is believing."
