学生服の袖ボタン<br/><br/>私は今日、学生服の袖にはボタンが付いている理由を知りました。<br/><br/>昔、ナポレオン軍がロシアに攻め入ったときのことです。<br/><br/>あまりに寒く、多くの兵士たちが袖で鼻水を拭いたそうです。<br/><br/>それを見たナポレオンは、「みっともない」と怒りました。<br/><br/>そして、鼻水を拭けないようにボタンをつけました。

<p class="correction_comment">You don't need "was" here. To conjugate "occur" in the past, just add an -ed at the end.</p>

<p class="correction_comment">Sounds a little weird. <br/><br/>Try "since it was so cold", or "since it was too cold for them to handle"</p>

<p class="correction_comment">Could needs to be used since it is the past tense. <br/><br/>Nose must be plural since you used "they"</p>
