<h1 id="subject_show">Yūmei Mujitsu (有名無実 - Titular)</h1>

Yūmei Mujitsu<br/><br/>I ate a famous food last week, but it was not delicious at all.<br/><br/>Something famous but superficial is referred to as 'yūmei mujitsu' (有名無実).<br/><br/>'Yū' (有) means "there is" or "exist," and 'mei' (名) means "name," so the literal meaning of the combination means "there is a name" or "name exists" -- it actually means "famous" or "well-known."<br/><br/> 'Mu' (無) means "no" or "nothing," and 'jitsu' (実) means "content," so the combination means "no content."<br/>('Mujitsu' is also used to mean "innocent.")<br/><br/>That is to say, 'yūmei mujitsu' means "it is famous but is void of content."

有名無実<br/><br/>私は先週、有名な食べ物を食べましたが、まったく美味しくありませんでした。<br/><br/>このように、有名だけれども内実を伴っていないもののことを、「有名無実」と言います。<br/><br/>「有」は "there is" や "to exist"、「名」は "name" を意味するので、「有名」の文字通りの意味は "there is a name" や "name exists" であり、実際には "famous" や "well-known" などを意味します。<br/><br/>「無」は "no" や "nothing"、「実」は "content" を意味するので、「無実」は "no content" を意味します。<br/>（「無実」は "innocent" を意味することも多いです。）<br/><br/>したがって、「有名無実」とは "It is famous, but is void of content" （有名だが、中身がない）ということを意味するわけです。

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/>I ate Sparus aurata fillet at a famous restaurant in a European country, but I was not fond of it.
