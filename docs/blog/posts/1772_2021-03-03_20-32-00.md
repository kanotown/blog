<h1 id="subject_show">Jūbako Yomi (重箱読み - Mixed Reading of Chinese and Japanese)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Mar 3, 2021 20:32</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Jūbako Yomi<br/><br/>In my post yesterday, I explained that it is not standard to read 代替 as 'daigae' (だいがえ).<br/><br/>When the reading of 代替 is 'daigae' (だいがえ), 代 is the Chinese reading, whereas 替 is the Japanese reading.<br/><br/>The combination of the Chinese and Japanese readings in this way is called 'jūbako yomi' (重箱読み) in Japanese.<br/><br/>'Jū' (重) means "overlap," 'bako/hako' (箱) means "box," and the combination 'jūbako' (重箱) means multitiered boxes in which food is stored. <br/><br/>Here, 'jū' is the Chinese reading, and 'bako' is the Japanese reading.<br/><br/>In addition, 'yomi' (読み) means "reading."<br/><br/>That is to say, 'jūbako yomi' means a term that is read as a mixture of a Chinese reading and a Japanese reading like 'jūbako'.

重箱読み<br/><br/>昨日の投稿で、「代替」を「だいがえ」と読むのは規範的ではないと説明しました。<br/><br/>「代替」の読みが「だいがえ」であるとすると、「代」は音読み、「替」は訓読みとなります。<br/><br/>このように、音読み（漢語）と訓読み（和語）が結合した読み方のことを「重箱読み」といいます。<br/><br/>「重」は "overlap"、「箱」は "box" を意味し、「重箱」はハレの日の料理を入れる、重ねることができる箱を差します。<br/><br/>ここで、「重」は音読み、「箱」は訓読みとなっています。<br/><br/>また、「読み」は "reading" を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち「重箱読み」とは、「重箱」の意味は関係なく、「重箱」のように音読みと訓読みが混ざった読み方を意味する表現というわけです。
