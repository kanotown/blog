むにゃむにゃ<br/><br/>意味のわからない言葉をつぶやくさまを、「むにゃむにゃ」という擬声語で表現することがあります。<br/><br/>恐らく、深い語源はなく、意味のわからない発言の音を単に表現しようとして生まれた言葉だと思われます。<br/><br/>「むにゃむにゃ」は特に、寝ぼけているときの不明瞭な発言や、意味不明な寝言を表す際によく使われます。<br/><br/>あるオンライン辞書では "talking with food in one's mouth" とありましたが、 口に食べ物を入れながら話すことを「むにゃむにゃ」とは普通言わないと思います。<br/><br/>「むにゃむにゃ」は、食べ物をゆっくり噛んで食べることを表すことはありますが、食べながら話すことを表す擬声語としては、「もごもご」が最も近いと思います。

<p class="correction_comment">Good English! Just, this should be two sentences. If you ever aren't sure, you're never wrong trying to keep sentences to just one clause. It'll always sound the most natural.</p>

 The main lesson to take away from this entry is that 'onomatopoeia' is more of a concept than a catch-all noun that you would put a definite article in front of. In English, we like to define things with precise details even when it's not really necessary, which is very different from Japanese! So, just a minor issue. Otherwise, I was very impressed with your English.
