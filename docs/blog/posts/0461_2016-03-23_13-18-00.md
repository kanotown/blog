クロロホルム<br/><br/>クロロホルムは、甘味と強く甘い芳香を持つ無色の液体です。<br/><br/>かつては一般的な吸入麻酔薬として外科手術の際に利用されました。<br/><br/>その他にも様々な用途があり、多くの研究機関でよく利用されています。<br/><br/>そして最も有名な用途は、ドラマや小説において、人を気絶させることだと思います。<br/><br/>しかし、クロロホルムを多少吸引してもせいぜい吐き気や頭痛が起こる程度で、気絶することはまずないそうです。<br/><br/>クロロホルムで気絶させるためには、大量に染み込ませたハンカチをゆっくりと力強く口に押し当て、5分ほど大きく深呼吸する必要があるそうです。<br/><br/>もはや窒息で気絶させたほうが早いと思います。
