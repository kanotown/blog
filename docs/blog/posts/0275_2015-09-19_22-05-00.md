日本では今日から、シルバーウィークが始まります。<br/><br/>シルバーウィークとは、休日や祝日が続く秋の期間のことで、今年は19日から23日までになります。<br/><br/>私はシルバーウィークの中で今日だけ、友人と遊ぶことにしました。<br/><br/>朝から長野北部に向けて出発し、昼食にチキンカツカレーを食べました。<br/><br/>その後、新潟の高原で牧場の牛乳やソフトクリームを食べました。<br/><br/>とても濃厚で美味しかったです。<br/><br/>それから神社を参拝し、最後に焼き肉をお腹いっぱい食べました。<br/><br/>とても充実した一日で、あっという間に過ぎました。<br/><br/>明日からは、再び研究を頑張ります。
