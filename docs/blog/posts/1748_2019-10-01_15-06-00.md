<h1 id="subject_show">Hito no Furi mite Wa-ga Furi Naose (人の振り見て我が振り直せ)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Oct 1, 2019 15:06</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Hito no Furi mite Wa-ga Furi Naose<br/><br/>The day before yesterday, I introduced the idiom 'hanmen kyōshi' (反面教師), which comes from China and means a negative exemplar.<br/><br/>There is a Japanese proverb that has a similar meaning to this -- it is 'hito no furi mite wa-ga furi naose' (人の振り見て我が振り直せ).<br/><br/>Since 'hito' (人) means "person," 'furi' (振り) means "behavior," ''mite' (見て) means "look," wa-ga' (我が) means "my," and 'naose' (直せ) means "fix," the literal meaning of this proverb is "Fix your behavior by looking other's behavior."<br/><br/>I think there is no need to explain the etymology.<br/><br/>It just says that you should learn what to do and what not to do from other's behavior.

人の振り見て我が振り直せ<br/><br/>二日前、中国の慣用句に由来する「反面教師」という言葉を紹介しました。<br/><br/>「反面教師」とよく似た日本のことわざに、「人の振り見て我が振り直せ」があります。<br/><br/>「人」は "person"、「振り」は "behavior"、「見て」は "look"、「我が」は "my"、「直せ」は "fix" を意味するので、このことわざの文字どおりの意味は "" となります。<br/><br/>特に説明は不要だと思います。<br/><br/>他人の行動を見て、良いところは見習い、悪いところは改めよということを言っているわけです。
