優柔不断<br/><br/>私はときどき「優柔不断」と言われます。<br/><br/>「優」は "kind"、「柔」は "soft" を意味し、どちらもポジティブなニュアンスを持ちますが、「優柔」という熟語になると、「決断力がない」や「気が弱くはきはきしない」などのネガティブな意味を持ちます。<br/><br/>また、「不」は否定語、「断」は "decision" を意味するので、「不断」は「優柔」と同様に「決断力がない」を意味します。<br/><br/>もちろん、これらを組み合わせた四字熟語「優柔不断」も、「決断力がない」という意味になります。<br/><br/>「優柔」や「不断」は単体で使われることは多くなく、大抵の場合は「優柔不断」の形で使われます。

No problem! I just learned another idiom in Japanese. :)<br/><br/>I was wondering about the irregular use of single and double quotes in your entry, but then I read your bio. I also think it would be helpful if Lang-8 allowed us to italicize texts. ^^
