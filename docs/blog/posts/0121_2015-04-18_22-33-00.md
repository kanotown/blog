The ring finger is known as a finger to wear a wedding ring.<br/><br/>In Greek mythology, it was believed that a left hand ring finger and a heart were connected each other by a single thick vessel.<br/><br/>In order to connect two hearts, wearing a wedding ring on a left hand ring finger became habitual.<br/><br/>However, in Germany or Spain, wearing a wedding ring on the right hand ring finger is common.<br/><br/>I don't know the detail, but there seems to be a religious background.<br/><br/>When married people travel abroad, it might be better to consider their wedding rings' position.
