Hanmen Kyōshi<br/><br/>There are many people and things that can be described as 'hanmen kyōshi' (反面教師) in the world.<br/><br/>(It is difficult to notice for myself, but I might become that.)<br/><br/>'Hanmen' (反面) means "other side" and 'kyōshi' (教師) means "teacher," so the literal meaning of 'hanmen kyōshi' is "the other side teacher."<br/><br/>Actually, it means a bad example that can be a material for reflection.<br/><br/>This four-character idiom was created by a leader of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong, and it was used for the first time in his speech in 1957.

反面教師<br/><br/>世の中は「反面教師」となる人や物事であふれています。<br/><br/>（私自身がそうかもしれません。）<br/><br/>「反面」は "other side"、「教師」は "teacher" を意味するので、「反面教師」の文字どおりの意味は "the other side teacher" です。<br/><br/>実際には、悪い見本として反省の材料となる人や物事のことを表します。<br/><br/>この四字熟語は、中国共産党の指導者、毛沢東によって発案され、1957年に行われた演説で初めて使われたようです。
