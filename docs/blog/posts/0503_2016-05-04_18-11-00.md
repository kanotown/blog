長野での家族旅行　二日目<br/><br/>今日はペンションで朝食を食べ、諏訪へ向かいました。<br/><br/>そして、プールや温泉に入って、のんびり過ごして、昼食を食べました。<br/><br/>その後はパターゴルフで遊び、解散となりました。<br/><br/>父親の還暦祝いと両親の結婚記念日を兼ねた旅行だったので、私と姉と弟は、色々なプレゼントを贈りました。<br/><br/>喜んでくれたようで、私たちも嬉しかったです。<br/><br/>今日はアパートでゆっくり休みます。<br/><br/>明日からはまた研究を再開します。

Thank you very much for correcting my post!<br/><br/>&gt; pension?<br/>Oh, sorry. I didn't know that "pension" isn't used as the meaning of "accommodation." "Pension" in European countries (and Japan) seems to correspond to "B&amp;B" in the US. Also, if Japanese people say "pension," it will mean "Western-style accommodation" in most cases.
