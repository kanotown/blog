締め切りに追われる<br/><br/>学会の原稿提出の締め切りが今朝9時だったので、徹夜しました。<br/>（残念ながら間に合わず、イタリアを訪れるチャンスを逃しました・・。）<br/><br/>このように、締め切りの間際に必死に仕事をすることを、よく「締め切りに追われる」と表現します。<br/><br/>「締め切り」は 'deadline,' 「追われる」は 'being chased' を意味するので、「締め切りに追われる」の文字通りの意味は "being chased by a deadline" となります。<br/><br/>「締め切り」という期日がすぐ後ろに迫ってきていることを、「追われる」という動詞で表現しているわけです。<br/><br/>英語では "being under a deadline" や "facing the pressure of a deadline" のように表現されます。

 Hi Toru!  Here are some other English expressions like 締め切りに追われる:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "struggling to {meet/make} a deadline"
 <br/>
 "rushing to {meet/make} a deadline"
 <br/>
 "chasing a deadline"  &lt;-- This one is really interesting because the person is the "chaser" rather than the one "being chased."
