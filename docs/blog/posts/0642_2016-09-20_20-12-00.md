<h1 id="subject_show">Horafuki</h1>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about the Japanese word "horafuki".<br/><br/>The literal meaning is "a person who blows Hora", and it expresses "a person who exaggerates things" or "a liar".<br/><br/>"Hora" in "horafuki" comes from "horagai" (conch), and you can use it as a wind instrument by boring a hole.<br/><br/>Horagai as a wind instrument is used for avoiding beasts, or giving a cue of march.<br/><br/>This is because horagai can emit a very loud sound than its looks.<br/><br/>From this fact, "hora" came to mean "an unexpected bonanza", and "an exaggerated lie".<br/><br/>By the way, "an exaggerated fiction" is referred to as "horabanashi"(a hora story).

ほら吹き<br/><br/>今日は、日本語の「ほら吹き」という言葉を紹介します。<br/><br/>「ほら吹き」は、「物事を大げさに言う人」や「嘘つき」を意味します。<br/><br/>「ほら」は「法螺貝」から来ており、法螺貝は穴を空けると吹奏楽器として用いることができます。<br/><br/>楽器としての法螺貝は、獣避けや戦陣の合図などに用いられてきました。<br/><br/>これは、見た目よりもとても大きな音を発しまするためです。<br/><br/>このことが転じて、「ほら」は意外な大儲けをすることを意味するようになり、さらには「大げさな嘘」を意味するようになりました。<br/><br/>「大げさな作り話」のことを「ほら話」と言ったりもします。
