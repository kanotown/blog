空間認識能力<br/><br/>空間認識能力とは、物体の形状や位置、姿勢などの三次元的な情報を素早く認識する能力です。<br/><br/>この能力はスポーツや仕事で活かせるだけでなく、車のバック駐車や地図を読む際などにも使われます。<br/><br/>また、空間認識能力が優れている人は、物事の全体像を把握し、本質を見抜くことに長けているとも言われています。<br/><br/>空間認識能力を高めるためには、キャッチボールをしたり、絵を描いたりするとよいそうです。

<p class="correction_comment">Personally, I think it sounds nicer when the 'when' is put before each predicate. Or any prepositional, really. <br/>Like "He went into the store and into the bathroom" as opposed to "he went into the store and bathroom". <br/>It's just personal preference though, I think!</p>
