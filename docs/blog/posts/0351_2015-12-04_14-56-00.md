Have you ever eaten insects?<br/><br/>My hometown of Aichi Prefecture don't have a culture of insect food, while those living in Nagano Prefecture where now I live sometimes eat locusts and hachinoko(which means bee larvae).<br/><br/>In fact, cooked locusts and bee larvae are sold in grocery stores.<br/><br/>I have an experience of eating such insects, but the taste wasn't too bad.<br/><br/>However, only the taste of silkworms was hideous for me, so I will never eat them again.<br/><br/>In the former Nagano Prefecture, since these insects were valuable protein sources, eating them was very important.

昆虫食<br/><br/>虫を食べたことはありますか？<br/><br/>私の故郷の愛知県ではそういう文化はありませんでしたが、今住んでいる長野県ではイナゴや蜂の子が時々食べられています。<br/><br/>実際、調理されたイナゴや蜂の子がスーパーで売られています。<br/><br/>私もイナゴや蜂の子を出されて食べたことがありますが、意外と普通の味でした。<br/><br/>ただし、蚕だけは苦手な味で、もう食べたいとは思いません。<br/><br/>かつての長野県では、これら昆虫は貴重なタンパク源で重宝されたとのことです。

<p class="correction_comment">A "culture" is the set of all the things make up that place's culture.  Each of those items is a *part* of that culture, but you don't call those items "cultures".  For example, you can say "sushi is a part of Japanese culture", but you can't say *"sushi is a Japanese culture".</p>

I've never eaten insects, but I hear that they can be eaten in Izu as well (I live in Shizuoka, but I don't visit Izu often).

Thank you very much for the kind corrections and comments!<br/>I learned a lot from you. :)<br/><br/>&gt; I hear that they can be eaten in Izu as well.<br/>I didn't know the fact, thank you for letting me know. :D<br/>I think it true, but Shizuoka (especially Izu) is famous for delicious seafood, so there might be no need to eat insects, haha.

 私はウミウシを食べたことがあります。ウミウシって海の昆虫みたいなやつですね。味は酷かったです。

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :D<br/>アリはギ酸（formic acid）のため酸っぱい味がするみたいですね。レモンティーの材料として、レモンの代わりに使われることがあると聞いたことがあります。<br/><br/>ウミウシ、食べられるんですね。私はあの見た目のものを食べたくはないです（笑）

A long time ago, in Nagano Prefecture, eating these insects was very important as they were valuable protein sources.
