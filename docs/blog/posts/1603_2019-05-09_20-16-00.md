ごまかす Part 2<br/><br/>昨日は "cover up something/tell a lie" を意味する「ごまかす」という言葉と、語源に関する二つの説の内一つを紹介しました。<br/><br/>もう一つの説は、真言宗の修行「護摩行」から来ているというものです。<br/><br/>「護摩」は供物や護摩木を燃やす儀式で、「行」は修行を意味します。<br/><br/>護摩行の後には、灰が残ります。<br/><br/>この灰（もしくはただの灰）を、真言宗の開祖である弘法大師が護摩行を行った際の灰だと偽り売る詐欺があったそうです。<br/><br/>そこから、そのような人を欺く行為を「護摩」に接尾文字「かす」をつけて「ごまかす」とい言うようになったというわけです。
