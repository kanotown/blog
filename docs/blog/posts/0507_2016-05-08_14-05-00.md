言語と貯金の関係<br/><br/>日本人は預貯金が好きな人が多いと言われており、その額の平均1000万円以上だそうです。<br/><br/>そして、イェール大学の研究によると、貯金額の多さはその国で話されている言語の文法に左右されているかもしれないとのことです。<br/><br/>英語では、未来のことを話すときは未来形を使い、現在とはっきり区別します。<br/><br/>そのため、未来のことを遠く感じ、長期的な見通しを怠る傾向があるそうです。<br/><br/>実際、未来形の存在しない言語話者のほうが、貯蓄する割合が高かったそうです。<br/><br/>日本語も、現在と未来の事象において、文法上の区別はありません。<br/><br/>そのため、未来のことが今現在に近いものと捉えられ、将来を不安に感じやすいです。<br/><br/>また、重要なことを最後に言う語順も、国民性に影響しているという意見もあります。

 Wow this is very interesting. I wonder if this affects those learning the language too. I hope I'm better at saving money because I learn Japanese :)
