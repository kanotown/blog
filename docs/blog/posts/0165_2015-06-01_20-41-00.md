I often read books and check emails in the morning.<br/><br/>However, I heard we should avoid such things.<br/><br/>Almost all tasks are divided into two types; brainworks and simple works.<br/><br/>In the morning, sympathetic becomes dominant, that is, our brains are active.<br/><br/>Therefore, we should do brainworks during the morning instead of simple works such as reading books or checking emails.<br/><br/>It is said that these simple works should be done during the evening or night, because parasympathetic becomes dominant in the night.
