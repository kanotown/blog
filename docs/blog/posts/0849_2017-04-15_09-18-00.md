 あの、質問してもよろしいですか。(」・ω・)
 <br/>
 <br/>
 どうして眉に唾をつけると騙されない効果が出ますか。ここにすごく気になっています。(&gt;_&lt;)
</p>

</div><div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
それには幾つか説があり、最後の文でその内の一つを簡単に紹介したつもりでしたが、ちょっと説明不足でしたね。<br/><br/>狐や狸は人を騙す際、人の心を読むために眉毛の本数を数えると考えられています。眉に唾をつけると、眉毛が湿って本数を数えにくくなるため、騙されにくくなると言われています。
