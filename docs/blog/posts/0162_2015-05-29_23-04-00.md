<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I taught about programming as in the case with yesterday.<br/><br/>However, I think my work went well than yesterday.<br/><br/>I felt a sense of accomplishment when the workshop was finished.<br/><br/>And I ate sushi for the first time in years with my friend as a little treat for myself.<br/><br/>Now, I'm watching Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets at a relaxed state.<br/><br/>I think I can be in a deep sleep tonight.
