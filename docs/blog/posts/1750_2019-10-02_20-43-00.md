<div class="date" hidden>Oct 2, 2019 20:43</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Tomin no Hi<br/><br/>October 1st was 'Tomin no Hi' (都民の日).<br/><br/>Since 'to' (都) means "Tokyo," 'min' (民) means "people/citizens," and 'hi' (日) means "day," the literal meaning of 'tomin no hi' is "Tokyo Citizens Day."<br/><br/>'Tomin no hi' was established by Tokyo in 1952, and most elementary schools, junior high schools, and high schools in Tokyo are closed on this day.<br/><br/>I had no idea about this day until recently, because I started living in Tokyo after graduating from my university.<br/><br/>I heard that many facilities in Tokyo, such as Tokyo Sky Tree, zoos and aquariums, are free to enter on this day.

<div id="post_ja"><div id="body_show_mo">
都民の日<br/><br/>10月1日は「都民の日」でした。<br/><br/>「都」は "Tokyo"、「民」は "people/residents"、「日」は "day" を意味するので、「都民の日」の文字どおりの意味は "Tokyo Residents Day" です。<br/><br/>都民の日は東京都が1952年に制定した記念日であり、東京都の小中高校は休校となるようです。<br/><br/>私は東京に住むようになったのは大学卒業後なので、このような日があることは最近まで知りませんでした。<br/><br/>都民の日には、東京スカイツリーや動物園、水族館など東京都にあるさまざまな施設の利用が無料になるようです。
