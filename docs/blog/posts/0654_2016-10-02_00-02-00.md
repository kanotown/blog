 Nice lesson for me as well, it's really easy to confuse the Japanese words when they all have the same English translation.

 Wow! I didn't know! Thank you for sharing. Great English, by the way. "Room temperature" is a really common way to refer to "normal temperature" :)

Thank you so much for correcting my post! (^^)<br/>Actually, I suffered from the choice; which should I use "room", "ordinary", or "ambient."<br/>Thank you for letting me know that :)
