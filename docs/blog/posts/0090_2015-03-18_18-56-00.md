多くの場合、マウスはコンピュータを使う際に必要なパーツです。<br/><br/>このマウスには、感度を表す単位が存在します。<br/><br/>単位の名前は「ミッキー」であり、1ミッキーは1/100インチだけマウスを動かすことを意味します。<br/><br/>マウスが何ミッキー移動したかをマウスドライバが取得し、カーソルが何ドット移動するかを決定します。<br/><br/>この単位の命名者はマイクロソフトのプログラマーだったクリス・ピーターズです。<br/><br/>何らかのキャラクターに由来したジョークなのかどうかは不明ですが、恐ろしい事態を防ぐために詮索はしないほうが良さそうです。<br/><br/>ﾊﾊｯ。

There is a unit that represents <span class="f_blue">the</span> <span class="f_gray">distance of movement of</span> <span class="f_blue">a</span> mouse.
<p class="correction_comment">"Sensitivity" gives me the relationship between how much I move the mouse and how much the cursor moves on the screen.

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/><br/>&gt; Perhaps "Mickey and Mouse" would sound funnier? Haha.<br/>Yes, indeed. But I felt this order was dangerous. haha.<br/><br/>&gt; Both godparent and 命名 can be associated with baptism, perhaps that was how the mistake came about.<br/>Yes. My dictionary said "godparent(godfather) means 名付け親," and we often use "名付け親" as the meaning of "namer." The dictionary also said like "this is used for baptism," but I missed the explanation, and I took a mistake.
