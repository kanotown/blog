結婚パーティー<br/><br/>昨日は大学時代の友人の結婚パーティーに参加してきました。<br/><br/>素敵な雰囲気のパーティで、久しぶりに大学の友人とも会えて楽しかったです。<br/><br/>昨日私は、結婚式を行わなかったカップルの3割が離婚すると書きましたが、これは誤りでした。<br/><br/>申し訳ありません。<br/><br/>実際は、日本人のカップル全体で、約3割が離婚するそうです。<br/><br/>そして、離婚したカップルの内の約8割が、結婚式を挙げていないようです。<br/><br/>日本人で結婚式を挙げないカップルは約半数なので、この調査は結婚式を挙げないと離婚しやすいという傾向を示唆しています。<br/><br/>一方、アメリカのエモリー大学の研究によると、アメリカでは結婚式にかける費用が高いほど別れやすい傾向があるとのことです。

 Got it.

 <br/>
 So the best scenario to avoid divorce is having a really cheap wedding ceremony!

Incidently I just remembered that I did witness a marriage ceremony in Japan (actually multiple times).<br/><br/>The one I remember the most vividly was in Osaka. Lots of people were watching outside (japanese and western tourists included). It was interesting.<br/><br/>There was a very "jajauma" young girl there. She was very funny. There was no controlling that child and the adults tried almost everything.<br/><br/>Very funny.
