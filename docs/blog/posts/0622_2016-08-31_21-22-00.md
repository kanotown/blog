うたう<br/><br/>今日は複数の異なる漢字を持つ「うたう」という言葉について紹介します。<br/><br/>「うたう」は通常「歌う」と書き、英語の "sing" に相当します。<br/><br/>基本的にはこの漢字だけ覚えていれば問題ありません。<br/><br/>"Sing" を意味する漢字には、他にも「唄う」「謡う」があります。<br/><br/>「唄う」は日本の伝統的な歌や、鳥などの動物が発するさえずりなどで使われることが多いです。<br/><br/>「謡う」は日本の童謡や民謡に対して使われることが多いです。<br/><br/>また、和歌などに対しては「詠う」を使います。<br/><br/>「謳う」も「うたう」と読みますが、これは何かを褒め称えるときや、言葉を強調したいときに使います。
