Yesterday, adoption results of kakenhi were published.<br/><br/>"Kakenhi" is one of the most famous competitive research funds in Japan.<br/><br/>Although my previous application was rejected, I brushed up the it and applied almost the same theme again.<br/><br/>If this application were also rejected, I would receive the fact that my theme has no value, and consider changing the theme.<br/><br/>Therefore, I was pretty nervous.<br/><br/>However, my application was adopted and research funding will be paid, so I am very happy now.<br/><br/>I have been spent poor research life so far, but I will somewhat be better financially in the future.

科研費<br/><br/>昨日、科研費の採択の結果が公表されました。<br/><br/>科研費とは日本で最も有名な、競争的研究資金のことを指します。<br/><br/>前回の応募は不採用だったにも関わらず、私は同じテーマをブラッシュアップして再び応募しました。<br/><br/>今回の応募も不採用だったら、そもそもその研究に価値が無いと判断されたことを受け止め、テーマの変更を検討するつもりでした。<br/><br/>そのため、かなり緊張していました。<br/><br/>しかし、無事採択され、研究費が支給されることが決まり、とても嬉しいです。<br/><br/>これまで貧乏な研究生活を送っていましたが、これからは少し潤います。
