オレンジデー<br/><br/>私は知りませんでしたが、今日4月14日はオレンジデーだそうです。<br/><br/>愛媛県の柑橘類生産農家が1994年に発案したものだそうで、バレンタインデー、ホワイトデーに続く第三の愛の記念日とのことです。<br/><br/>発祥の由来は、オレンジの花言葉が「花嫁の喜び」だからです。<br/><br/>また、全く定着していませんが、今日は「フレンドリーデー」と「パートナーデー」でもあるそうです。<br/><br/>ちなみに、韓国では「ブラックデー」が定着しています。<br/><br/>ブラックデーは、バレンタインデーとホワイトデーで恋人ができなかった人々が慰め合う日だそうです。

 Interesting! Btw in the U.S they have the "Green Day". It's the name of a rock band from California.
