<h1 id="subject_show">Uzai (うざい - Annoying)</h1>

In order to travel to Japan or enjoy Japanese contents, I think that you need to learn not only textbook terms but also several slang terms that are used by young people.<br/><br/>This is the reason why I sometimes introduce slang terms here.<br/><br/>If you use slang terms in a conversation, maybe you can give an impression that you are good at the language.<br/><br/>However, I recommend that you don't use negative slang terms very much, though you should understand the meaning.<br/><br/>For example, there is an expression, "uzai," which means "annoying" or "depressing."<br/><br/>Uzai is short for "uzattai," and uzattai comes from the onomatopoeia, "uzauza" or "ujauja," which represents that similar things are gathered or someone says something stupid repeatedly.

うざい<br/><br/>日本に旅行したり、日本のコンテンツを楽しむためには、上品な日本語だけではなく、若者が使う俗語も学ぶ必要があると思います。<br/><br/>これが私が俗語も紹介する理由です。<br/><br/>俗語を会話で使うと、その言語に達者であるという印象を与えられるかもしれませんが、否定的な意味の俗語は理解するだけに留め、あまり使わないことをおすすめします。<br/><br/>例えば、「鬱陶しい」や「煩わしい」を意味する「うざい」という表現があります。<br/><br/>「うざい」は「うざったい」の略で、「うざったい」は似た物が沢山あつまっている様子や退屈なことをくどくど言う様子を意味する擬態語「うざうざ」「うじゃうじゃ」から来ているとされています。

 Quite interesting! I often hear this in anime. Although I didn't know it came from the word "Uzattai"

 Interesting! I've heard that this word is exclusive to the Kansai dialect.

Thank you so much always for correcting my post!<br/>It's thought that uzai (uzattai) comes from a dialect of Tama district. However, now this is used throughout Japan. :)
