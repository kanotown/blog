<h1 id="subject_show">Sum of the Reciprocals of the Primes</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Mar 3, 2015 23:23</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I'd like to talk about one of the most famous Euler's story.<br/><br/>Have you ever thought what the sum of the reciprocals of the primes will become?<br/><br/>Maybe most people know that the sum of the reciprocals of the natural number diverges to infinity (1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ･･･ = ∞). <br/><br/>(Note that the sum of the reciprocals of the square of the natural number converges to π^2/6.)<br/><br/>In 1737, Euler proved that the sum of the reciprocals of the natural number diverges to infinity (1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + ･･･ = ∞).<br/><br/>Although that the number of primes are infinite was known in about 300 B.C., anyone couldn't solve the problem during about 2000 years.<br/><br/>This is no wonder, since the divergence speed of the sum of the reciprocals of the primes is extremely slow.<br/><br/>It's known that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes from 2 until 1801241230056600523 is finally exceeds 4 (to be specific, 4.0000000000000000002).<br/><br/>In order to exceed 5, we need primes until around 65 digits .<br/><br/>This is a horrible amount of numbers.<br/><br/>It's not possible to store all of these primes even if we could use all storage media on the planet.<br/><br/>Euler had really great foresight.<br/><br/>Actually, he proved this problem when he was 28, and this year, I will become 28.<br/><br/>I hope to be able to prove something this year, hehe.
