Thank you so much for correcting my post and letting me know the expression!<br/>I learned something new. :)<br/><br/>By the way, I used the word "profusion" because I referred to the following pages:<br/><a href="http://www.romajidesu.com/dictionary/meaning-of-" target="_blank">http://www.romajidesu.com/dictionary/meaning-of-</a>%E7%B9%9A.html<br/><a href="https://www.nihongomaster.com/dictionary/entry/46930/hyakkaryouran" target="_blank">https://www.nihongomaster.com/dictionary/entry/46930/hyakkaryouran</a>
