Kotoba no Aya<br/><br/>Have you ever been in a situation where you used a complex expression that could be interpreted in several different ways and caused misunderstanding?<br/><br/>In such a situation, especially when the expression is misunderstood in a bad way, you can use the term 'kotoba no aya' (言葉の綾) to explain the situation.<br/><br/>Since 'kotoba' (言葉) means "words," and 'aya' (綾) means "various shapes and patterns," the literal meaning of 'kotoba no aya' is "words in various shapes and patterns."<br/><br/>Originally, this term mainly meant "skillful wording for a matter that is difficult to express." However, it is now usually used to mean "a complex expression that could be interpreted in several different ways."

言葉の綾<br/><br/>複数の解釈ができる表現を使ってしまい、誤解を与えそうになってしまった経験はありますか？<br/><br/>そのようなとき、特に悪い意味で解釈される可能性があるとき、釈明の言葉として「言葉の綾」を使うことができます。<br/><br/>「言葉」は "words"、「綾」は "various shapes and patterns"（さまざまな形や模様） を意味するので、「言葉の綾」の文字どおりの意味は "words in various shapes and patterns" となります。<br/><br/>もともとは「表現しにくい事柄の巧みな言い回し」を意味する言葉でしたが、現在では「複数の解釈ができる複雑な表現」の意味で使われることが多いです。
