The World's Shortest Love Letter Part 2<br/><br/>When the New Year came, the research members in the Antarctic got messages with telegrams from their families.<br/><br/>Among them, a wife of a member tried to send a message from Japan by her own hands with the help of engineers.<br/><br/>The message was アナタ (read as 'anata'), which means "you" in English.<br/><br/>Since these characters looked as if it was a love letter containing various feelings, such as "love," "loneliness," and "anxiety," the research members were deeply impressed.<br/><br/>However, what she really wanted to say was "You, don't drink too much."
