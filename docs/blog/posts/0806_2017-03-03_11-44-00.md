<h1 id="subject_show">Kubi (Dismissal)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Mar 3, 2017 11:44</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the slang term "クビ (kubi)."<br/><br/>"クビ" is Katakana form of a kanji character "首," which means "neck," and if you write the kanji in Katakana or Hiragana, it often means "dismissal/displacement."<br/><br/>For example: <br/>"Kubi ni natta." (This literal meaning is "I became a neck," and it expressed "I was fired.") <br/><br/>"Kimi wa kubi da." (This literal meaning is "You are a neck," and it expressed "You're fired.")<br/><br/>In the Edo period in Japan, criminals were cut their necks using Japanese swords.<br/><br/>By identifying such executions with displacements, "kubi wo kiru" (to cut a neck) came to mean to dismiss someone.<br/><br/>Furthermore, just "kubi" (neck) came to mean "dismissal."<br/><br/>I think that these terms are similar to "get axed" or "get the ax" in English.

クビ<br/><br/>今日は「クビ」という俗語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「クビ」は「首」という漢字をカタカナで書いたものですが、このように書くと、「解雇」を意味することが多いです。<br/><br/>例えば、「クビになった（解雇された）」「君はクビだ（君は解雇だ）」などと使います。<br/><br/>江戸時代の日本において、罪人は首を日本刀で切断することで処刑されました。<br/><br/>この処刑を解雇に喩えて、解雇することを「首を切る」と言うようになり、「クビ」だけでも解雇を意味するようになりました。<br/><br/>英語では "get axed" や "get the ax" とう表現がありますが、これに近いと思います。

<p class="correction_comment">I think "means" instead of "expresses" is more natural, but it still gets the point across.<br/>When I think of "expresses", I think of something emotional.<br/>For instance, "Hopper's art expresses the everyday loneliness of the American people" or something like that.</p>
