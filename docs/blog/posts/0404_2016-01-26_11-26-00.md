放送禁止用語<br/><br/>先日、日本のテレビ局が「頑張れ」を放送禁止用語の候補に入れていることが話題になりました。<br/><br/>なにやら、「プレッシャーを感じる」というクレームが入ったことが原因のようです。<br/><br/>しかし、あまり理解できません。<br/><br/>「頑張れ」は誰かを応援する際に用いる汎用的なフレーズで、私もよく使ってきました。<br/><br/>中には「既に頑張っているのに頑張れと言われると腹が立つ」という人がいますが、私は必死に頑張っている状態でも「頑張れ」と声をかけてもらえると涙が出るくらい嬉しくなります。<br/><br/>日本人の間でも言葉に対するイメージに隔たりができているようです。<br/><br/>これは、「頑張れ」が様々な意味を含んでいることに起因しているかもしれません。<br/><br/>注意が必要ですね。

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/>Yes, I also think it's a encouraging phrase. But somehow some Japanese don't seem to want to be encouraged.

 Wow! Interesting topic! As an English speaker, I like 頑張れ because there isn't a clear English equivalent and I can say all of those things (like "good luck," "you can do it," etc) all at once! :D

 あー！これおもしろい！
 <br/>
 <br/>
 日本人の友達は仕事を頑張りすぎるから、僕は彼女に「頑張れ！」と言いたくないです。でも、彼女はそういう時に「頑張れ！」と言われるのが好きです。
 <br/>
 <br/>
 だから僕はいつも「お仕事頑張れ！まぁ、頑張らなくてもいいけど…」と言います(笑)
 <br/>
 <br/>
 でもこの投稿を読んで、そう言われるのが嫌だと思う日本人もいるのを初めて知った。
 <br/>
 <br/>
 僕は、「あまり無理しないで」と言いたくなります。

Thank you for the comment!<br/>It's interesting.<br/><br/>そうですね、仕事を頑張りすぎてる人に対しては「無理をしないでね」と言うのも良いですね。これは「私はあなたが頑張っていることを知っている」というニュアンスを含む、とても優しい言葉です。<br/><br/>私はロードバイクのレースに出て必死に山を登っているとき、地元の人に「頑張れ！」と声をかけられたことがあります。この時、涙が出そうになるくらい嬉しくなり、力が湧いてきました。こういう時は「頑張れ」のほうがいいと思います（笑）

 Hi Kanotownさん！
 <br/>
 I do like that word too. However, I could understand a little why the Japanese would feel that way. Maybe because sometimes when people say 頑張れ to them, they feel more obligated to do well, hence turning it into pressure instead of encouragement. I say that because sometimes when my friends say "all the best!", it is another way of saying good luck and I know it, but I feel even more pressurized to do well so as not to disappoint them.

Thank you very much always for correcting my post, Yukinekorin san :)<br/>Now I understand. Your comment reminded me of that I was told something like "君ならもちろん余裕でできるよね、良い結果を期待しているよ (I know of course you can do it easily, can't you? I have a high expectation for your result)." At that time, I was glad, but was also very nervous and felt a heavy pressure, haha.
</div>
<div class="name"><span class="just_name">Yukinekorin</span><br>
いつでもどうぞ ^^<br/>Yup, I certainly felt that way too! I guess it is a matter of how people view a certain word. And well, I think these kind of things don't have a right or wrong answer hahaha.
