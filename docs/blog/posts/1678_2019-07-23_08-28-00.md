<h1 id="subject_show">Kibisu wo Kaesu (踵を返す - Returning Back)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Jul 23, 2019 08:28</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Kibisu wo Kaesu<br/><br/>When I read a Japanese novel, I found that the idiom 'kibisu wo kaesu' (踵を返す) appears repeatedly.<br/><br/>踵 (meaning "heel") is usually read as 'kakato', however, it is read as 'kibisu' (which is an old reading) in this idiom.<br/><br/>In addition, 'kaesu' (返す) means "to return" or "to take back," so the literal meaning of 'kibisu wo kaesu' is "to return one's heel(s)."<br/><br/>Imagine that you return your heels to the direction in which you had come -- in other words, this idiom means "to go back" or "to return back."

踵を返す<br/><br/>ある小説を読んでいると、「踵を返す」という表現が何度も出てきました。<br/><br/>"" を意味する「踵」は通常「かかと」と読みますが、この慣用句の中では「きびす」と読みます。<br/><br/>また、「返す」は "to return" や "to take back" を意味するので、「踵を返す」の文字どおりの意味は "to return one's heel(s)" となります。<br/><br/>「踵」を元来た方角に戻すことから、「踵を返す」は「後戻りする」や「引き返す」といった意味を持ちます。

 In English, I think that this would mean "to turn tail (and run)."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It basically means 引き返す (to retrace one's steps) but has has an extra dimension of fear and/or cowardice. Like how a cat will draw in its tail if feels threatened.

Thank you for the comment! I learned something new. :)<br/>But I think that 踵を返す do not include nuances of and/or cowardice. It is just another expression of 引き返す.

I meant that the English expression has the "extra" meaning.

 Is the Japanese language hard to learn or master even for Japanese people? (just curious ^ ^ )

Thank you for reading my post!<br/>Yes, it is difficult even for us to remember various readings of kanji. :)
