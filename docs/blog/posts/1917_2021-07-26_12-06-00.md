亀の甲より年の功<br/><br/>年長者が積み重ねてきた経験や知識は、とても重要で、尊重するべきものです。<br/><br/>このことを表すことわざに、「亀の甲より年の功」があります。<br/><br/>「亀」は "turtle"、「甲」は "shell"、「より」は "more than"、「年」は "year"、「功」は "rich experience" や "long years" を意味します。<br/><br/>すなわち、「亀の甲より年の功」の文字どおりの意味は、"(You should respect) elders' rich experience more than the turtle shell" （亀の甲羅よりも、長い年月で培った経験を尊重するべきである）となります。<br/><br/>ここで、「亀の甲」は「年の功」の語感を整えるために付け加えられたもので、深い意味はありません。

Thank you for the correction! :)<br/><br/>&gt; any would negate the meaning. like doesnt have any meaning.<br/><br/>Actually, I wanted to say something like, "turtle's shell was just added for the rhyming of this phrase, so there is no semantic relationship between the turtles' shell and the elders' experience, (that is, there is no deeper meaning)" here. Therefore, I probably should have said "there is no deeper meaning" or "it doesn't have any deep meaning."
