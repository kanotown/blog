Me ga Nai<br/><br/>When you want to describe that someone is fond of something heavily and crazily, you can use the Japanese idiom 'me ga nai' (目がない).<br/><br/>'Me' (目) means "eye" and 'nai' (ない) means "do not have" or "nothing," so the literal meaning of this idiom is "one does not have eyes."<br/><br/>If you do not have your eyes, the ability to see and judge things will down.<br/><br/>That is to say, 'me ga nai' implies that someone is too fond of something to see/judge anything.<br/><br/>Note that when this is used as 'miru me ga nai' (見る目がない) by adding 'miru' (見る - literally "seeing"), it literally means that someone has no eyes to judge/is blind to things.

目がない<br/><br/>何かに夢中になって、思慮分別を無くすほど好きであることを、「目がない」と言うことがあります。<br/><br/>「目」は "eye," 「ない」は "do not have" や "nothing" を意味するので、「目がない」の文字通りの意味は "one does not have eyes" となります。<br/><br/>目がないと何も見えないので、物事を判断する力が落ちてしまいます。<br/><br/>すなわち「目がない」とは、何も見えなくなるくらい何かに心を奪われてくれるということです。<br/><br/>ただし、「見る目がない」のように使う場合は、文字通り「物事を判断する力がない」という意味になります。

 That's so interesting! In other words, it means to like something without thinking about or noticing any flaws? So it could be used for 物事 as well as 人, such as a new girlfriend, right?

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/>&gt; So it could be used for 物事 as well as 人, such as a new girlfriend, right?<br/>Yes, this idiom could be used for things and people.<br/>However, if you want to say that someone is crazy fond of someone, I think it will be more natural to use （人に）夢中になる or （人に）骨抜きにされる。

 Thanks!  Can you show me an example of how to use it?
</p>

</div><div class="name"><span class="just_name">Toru</span><br>
Thank you for the comment!<br/>This is often used like （人）は（物事）に目がない。<br/>For example:<br/>僕は甘いものに目がない。(I am fond of sweet food.)<br/>彼は熱帯魚に目がない。(He is fond of tropical fish.)
