Kiki Semaru<br/><br/>I sometimes see actors/actresses who have a face described as 'kiki semaru' (鬼気迫る) in movies and dramas.<br/><br/>'Kiki semaru' means that something is extremely serious or ghastly, and it is often attached to 'kao' (顔 - "face"), 'hyōjō' (表情 - "facial expression"), 'engi' (演技 - "performance"), or 'fun-iki' (雰囲気 - "atmosphere").<br/><br/>'Ki' (鬼) means "ogre," 'ki' (気) means "feeling" or "whiff," and 'semaru' (迫る) means "to approach," so the literal meaning of 'kiki semaru' is "a whiff of an ogre is approaching."<br/><br/>If you feel a creepy whiff of an ogre, your face and behavior will be very serious and ghastly.<br/><br/>This expression represents such seriousness.

鬼気迫る<br/><br/>映画やドラマの中で、役者はしばしば「鬼気迫る」表情をしています。<br/><br/>「鬼気迫る」は「恐ろしいほど真剣なさま」を意味する表現で、「顔」や「表情」、「演技」、「雰囲気」など修飾します。<br/><br/>「鬼」は "ogre"、「気」は "feeling/whiff "、「迫る」は "to approach" を意味するので、「鬼気迫る」の文字どおりの意味は "a whiff of an ogre is approaching" となります。<br/><br/>鬼の不気味な気配が近づくとき、あなたの顔や行為はきっと恐ろしく真剣なものになります。<br/><br/>「鬼気迫る」はそのような真剣さを表す言葉というわけです。
