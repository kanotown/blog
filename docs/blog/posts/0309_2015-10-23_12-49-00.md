Summer in Japan, we often see furin.<br/><br/>Furin is called "wind chimes" in English, and it tinkles with cool sounds while winds are  blowing.<br/><br/>When we hear the sound of hurin, our brains are misled into thinking that it's cool, and our body surface temperature drops about 2 degrees.<br/><br/>However, this law seems to be applicable only to Japanese people, and not applicable to overseas people.<br/><br/>I think it's really interesting that such a sound can decrease our body temperature.

風鈴<br/><br/>日本の夏は、風鈴をよく見かけます。<br/><br/>風鈴とは、小さい鐘のようなもので、風がふくと涼しげな音が鳴ります。<br/><br/>風鈴の音を聞くと脳が涼しいと錯覚し、体表面温度が2度程度下がるそうです。<br/><br/>しかしこれは日本人にのみ適用される法則で、外国人には当てはまらないようです。<br/><br/>音を聞くだけで体温が下がるのは、大変興味深いです。
