内緒<br/><br/>英語の "secret" は、日本語でよく「秘密」と訳されますが、「内緒」と訳すこともできます。<br/><br/>「内緒」は「秘密」に比べて口語的で、砕けた表現です。<br/><br/>この言葉は、仏教用語の「内証」から来ており、「内証」は「自らの心のうちで真理を語ること」を意味するサンスクリット語を漢訳したものです。<br/><br/>後に「内証」は「外から知ることが出来ない秘密」を意味するようになり、「内緒」へと変化しました。<br/><br/>ちなみに、ゼルダの伝説シリーズにおいて、秘密の部屋でNPCに話しかけると、「ミンナニ(ハ) ナイショダヨ」と言ってルピーをくれます。
