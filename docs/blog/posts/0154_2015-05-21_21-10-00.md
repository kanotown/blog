We blink our eyes about twenty times per minute.<br/><br/>Since one blink block our view about 0.3 seconds, we spend 6 seconds per minute in the dark(that is, 10% of our living hours).<br/><br/>If you watch a two hour movie, you will miss about twelve minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>However, since we naturally blink at breaks between scenes, we don't feel a sense of discomfort.<br/><br/>It is said that the reason why we blink is to moist the surface of our eyes, but the number of blinks we need for the moistening is only three times per minute.<br/><br/>It has not yet been elucidated why we blink so many times.

瞬きの回数の意味<br/><br/>私達は、1分間に約20回の瞬きをします。<br/><br/>1回の瞬きによる視界の遮断は約0.3秒なので、1分間で6秒、すなわち起きている時間の10％を暗闇で過ごしていることになります。<br/><br/>2時間の映画を見た場合、12分程度は目に入っていないことになります。<br/><br/>しかし人間は、シーンの切れ目などで自然と瞬きをするので、全ての映像を見たと感じます。<br/><br/>瞬きは目の表面を湿潤させるためだと言われていますが、湿潤のためだけなら1分間に3回程度でいいそうです。<br/><br/>なぜ私達がこんなにも瞬きをするのかは、まだ解明されていません。

Thank you so much for your corrections and comment!<br/>Yeah, babies are very strong to the game, haha. It is said that they blink their eyes about ten times per minute. But I feel as if they are always gazing at something with eyes dilated.
