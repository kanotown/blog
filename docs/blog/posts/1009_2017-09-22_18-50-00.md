足が出る<br/><br/>私は今月、収入よりも支出のほうが圧倒的に多かったです。<br/><br/>このように、予算や収入よりも出費が多くなることを、「足が出る」と言います。<br/><br/>「足が出る」の文字どおりの意味は "a leg protrudes" です。<br/><br/>「足が出る」の有力な語源としては、二つの説があります。<br/><br/>一つは、この「足」が「お金」を意味しているというものです。<br/><br/>お金は世の中を駆け回ることから、日本では「お足」と呼ばれることがあります。<br/><br/>もう一つは、着物を作る時に予算不足で生地が十分でないと、寸が足らず足が着物からはみ出るということからというものです。

Thank you so much for correcting my post!<br/>&gt; Instead of "textures", do you mean "patterned cloth" or "material"?<br/>Yes, I think that these terms you wrote are more appropriate as what I meant.
