オープンキャンパス<br/><br/>今日私の大学では「オープンキャンパス」と呼ばれるイベントが催されました。<br/><br/>「オープンキャンパス」は、大学や専門学校が、入学を検討している人に対して、施設の公開や説明などを行うイベントです。<br/><br/>模擬的な講義や、研究室見学ツアー、学食、スタンプラリー、無償送迎バスなどを提供する大学もあります。<br/><br/>かつて、大学はその構内を積極的に公開していませんでしたが、2000年代以降は多くの大学でオープンキャンパスが開催されるようになりました。<br/><br/>英語の "open campus" とは意味が異なるようなので、注意して下さい。
