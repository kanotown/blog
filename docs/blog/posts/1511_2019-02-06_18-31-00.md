<h1 id="subject_show">Ippai Ippai (いっぱいいっぱい - Having One's Hands Full)</h1>

<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Ippai Ippai<br/><br/>I have been in a state called 'ippai ippai' (いっぱいいっぱい).<br/><br/>'Ippai ippai' means that there is almost no time to do something or something has reached the limitation.<br/><br/>'Ippai' (いっぱい) is written as 一杯 in kanji -- 'i/ichi' (一) means "one" and 'pai/hai' (杯) means "cup" or "bowl," so the literal meaning of the combination is "a cup of something" or "a bowl of something."<br/><br/>In addition, the characters 一杯 can mean that a cup/bowl is full of something.<br/><br/>That is to say, 'ippai ippai' implies that such a state of limit.

いっぱいいっぱい<br/><br/>私は今、「いっぱいいぱい」の状態に陥っています。<br/><br/>「いっぱいいっぱい」とは、少しの余裕もないさまや、何かが最大限まで達しているさまを表す言葉です。<br/><br/>「いっぱい」を漢字で書くと「一杯」であり、「一」は "one"、「杯」は "cup" や "bowl" を意味するので、「一杯」の文字どおりの意味は "a cup of something" や "a bowl of something" となります。<br/><br/>また、「一杯」という字は、容器に何かが満ち溢れるほど入っていることを表すこともできます。<br/><br/>「いっぱいいっぱい」は、そのような限界の状態を示唆しているというわけです。

'Ippai ippai' means that there is almost no time to do something or something has reached its limit/limits.
<p class="correction_comment">Your sentence is okay and presents a clear thought. A bit of it is worded a little odd. This might be better:<br/><br/>reached the limitation --&gt; reached its limit/limits</p>

That is to say, 'ippai ippai' implies that such a state of limit.
<p class="correction_comment">As written it presents an incomplete thought. <br/><br/>"... implies that such a state of limit" is/has what?<br/><br/>... implies that such a state of limit has been reached<br/><br/>"such a state of limit" is an odd wording. It's not wrong just odd.<br/><br/>... implies that it has reached its limits <br/><br/>On second though, you have really specified a single identifiable thing/class to directly refer back to.  Maybe<br/><br/>implies that something has reached its limits<br/><br/>Thoughts?</p>

Thank you so much for the correction!<br/>Ah, I made a mistake.<br/>I think "implies that something has reached its limits" is closest to what I wanted to say.
