<h1 id="subject_show">Shi ni Mono Gurui (死に物狂い - For Life)</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Aug 28, 2021 17:03</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Shi ni Mono Gurui<br/><br/>When you work on something seriously so hard that  you don't even fear death, it can be described as 'shi ni mono gurui' (死に物狂い) in Japanese.<br/><br/>'Shi' (死) means "death," 'mono' (物) means "thing," and 'gurui/kurui' (狂い) means "crazy."<br/><br/>This phrase was coined by adding the word 'shi' to the idiom 'mono gurui' (物狂い), which means to lose one's mind over something.<br/><br/>For example, you can say 'shi ni mono gurui de hataraita' (死に物狂いで働いた - meaning "I worked for life.")

<p class="correction_comment">Seriously is an adverb so it should be by the verb it is modifying. <br/><br/>Deleted the comma</p>

Thank you for the correction!<br/>The grammar checking software I use, Grammarly, tells me to add a comma after "death" in that sentence, but would it be more natural to remove it? I try to be as formal as possible in my writing.

I think Grammarly is right and I was wrong. <br/><br/>2. Use commas after introductory a) clauses, b) phrases, or c) words that come before the main clause.<br/><br/>a. Common starter words for introductory clauses that should be followed by a comma include after, although, as, because, if, since, when, while.<br/><br/>While I was eating, the cat scratched at the door.<br/><br/>Because her alarm clock was broken, she was late for class.<br/><br/>If you are ill, you ought to see a doctor.

Thank you for the explanation!<br/>Perhaps there is a gap between grammatical correctness and what is natural for native speakers.
