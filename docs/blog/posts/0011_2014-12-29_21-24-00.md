今朝は雪が沢山降っていました。<br/><br/>私は車に積もった雪と車の周辺の雪をどけて、駐車場から車をバックで出そうとしました。<br/><br/>雪のため後ろがしっかりと確認できていませんでしたが、バックした先には駐車中の車があったのです。<br/><br/>「ガンッ」と音が鳴り、顔が青ざめ、生きた心地がしませんでした。<br/><br/>相手の車のナンバープレートと、私の車の左側のリアが凹んでしまいました。<br/><br/>幸い車には誰も乗っておらず、持ち主は近くにいたので、すぐに話し合うことができました。<br/><br/>私は警察に連絡しようとしましたが、相手にはそんな必要は無いと言われました。<br/><br/>話し合いの結果、修理費用だけ後日請求してもらうことになりました。<br/><br/>大事故にならず、そして相手がいい人で、良かったです。<br/><br/>これからはもっと慎重に運転したいです。<br/>
