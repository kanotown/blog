壁に耳あり障子に目あり<br/><br/>今日は日本のことわざ「壁に耳あり障子に目あり」を紹介します。<br/><br/>このことわざは、隠し事や陰口は漏れやすいということを表しています。<br/><br/>「壁に耳あり」は、常に誰かが壁に耳をあてて聞いているかもしれない、ということです。<br/><br/>「障子に目あり」は、誰かが障子に穴をあけて覗き見しているかもしれない、ということです。<br/><br/>すなわち、いつ誰が見聞きしているかわからないので、注意しなさいという戒めのことわざです。<br/><br/>ちなみにアメリカにも、"Walls have ears" (壁は耳を持っている) という同じ意味のことわざがあるそうです。

 Almost perfect =)
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Interestingly I know of two expressions "The walls have ears" and "The walls have eyes", which are both similar in meaning but are two separate expressions instead of one.

 Wow! Yes, we have the exact same phrase! "The walls have ears!"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I wonder how many phrases there are that are the same in Japanese and English? It seems there are a lot!

Thank you so much for correcting my post again! :)<br/>Indeed it seems there are a lot. I think that many phrases that are popular in Japan come from English or Chinese.
