Sandome no Shōjiki<br/><br/>Recently I have been looking for a new job.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I failed in job interviews several times, but it seems that somehow I would pass the interview last week.<br/><br/>If you want to express that the first and second time would not go well, but the third time would go well like my case, you can use a Japanese proverb, 'sandome no shōjiki' (三度目の正直).<br/><br/>'San' (三) means "three," 'dome' (度目) means "__ times" or "__th," and 'shōjiki' means "sincerity."<br/><br/>However, I failed in interviews three times, and it went well in the fourth interview, so I should say 'yondome no shōjiki' (四度目の正直 - the fourth time's the charm).

三度目の正直<br/><br/>私はここ最近、就職活動をしていました。<br/><br/>残念なことに、面接で何度か続けて落とされましたが、先週受けた面接は通ったようです。<br/><br/>このように、一度目や二度目はあてにならなくても、三度目はうまくいくことを表すことわざに「三度目の正直」があります。<br/><br/>「三」は "three," 「度目」は "__ times" や "__th," 「正直」は "sincerity" を意味します。<br/><br/>ただし、私は面接を3回落とされ、4回目でうまくいったので、「四度目の正直」と言うべきかもしれません。

Unfortunately, I failed in job interviews several times, but it seems that somehow I <span class="f_red">passed </span>the interview last week.
<p class="correction_comment">Usually, we don't talk about "passing" and "failing" interviews for jobs in this way. It is more common to say things like "my interview went well" or "I did not get the job".<br/><br/>"Unfortunately, my first few interviews did not go so well, but I must have done well in my interview last week because I got the job."<br/><br/>If you wanted to use terminology like "pass" and "fail", you could say something like this:<br/><br/>"Unfortunately, I failed my first few interviews, but I succeeded in my interview last week."</p>
