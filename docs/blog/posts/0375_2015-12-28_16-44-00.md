サンタクロースの試験<br/><br/>今日はグリーンランド国際サンタクロース協会公認のサンタクロースになるために必要な過酷な試験を紹介します。<br/><br/>この試験を受けるためには、結婚していて子供がいて、サンタクロースとしての活動経験があり、体重が120kg以上であることが必要です。<br/><br/>書類審査を通過したら、自宅からサンタクロースの姿でコペンハーゲンの試験会場まで向かいます。<br/><br/>その後体力測定を行い、上位2名が長老サンタクロースの面接を英語かデンマーク語で受けられます。<br/><br/>面接の後は、衣装を出身の伝統に合わせて自作しているかなどの身だしなみの審査が行われ、最後にサンタクロースの誓いの言葉を「Ho Ho Ho」だけで朗読します。<br/><br/>試験の後、長老サンタクロースと公認サンタクロース全員の承認を得ることで、新しい公認サンタクロースとなることができます。<br/><br/>現在公認サンタクロースは120人で、その内日本人が一人だけいるようです。

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; do you mean the way Santa Claus traditionally looks in one's hometown?<br/>Sorry for my confusing English. I wanted to mean that you have to dress up as Santa Claus during a movement from your house to the venue. The difficult point is that you have to be Santa Claus even in an airplane.

Thanks for clearing that up.  In that case, I would change the word order to something like this: "... you have to go from your home to the exam venue in Copenhagen while dressed up as Santa Claus."<br/><br/>If an American was to go to this exam, they would have to go through a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) security checkpoint.  I can't help but laugh at the idea of Santa Claus going through TSA security!  :)
