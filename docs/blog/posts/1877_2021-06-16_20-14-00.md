<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Kuchi wo Suppaku Suru<br/><br/>Telling someone the same thing over and over again is expressed as 'kuchi wo suppaku suru' (口を酸っぱくする) in Japanese.<br/><br/>Since 'kuchi' (口) means "mouth," 'suppaku/suppai' (酸っぱく/酸っぱい) means "soar," and 'suru' (する) means "to make," the literal meaning of 'kuchi wo suppaku suru' is "to make one's mouth soar"<br/><br/>The etymology of this phrase has not been cleared, but the following two theories are possible:<br/><br/>One theory is that it came from the fact that when one's mouth dries out due to continuous talking, the oral cavity becomes acidic, which lead to feel sour.<br/><br/>The other theory says that it came from that when you tell the same thing repeatedly, your facial expression would become as if you have eaten something sour.

口を酸っぱくする<br/><br/>同じことを、何度も繰り返して人に言うことを、「口を酸っぱくする」といいます。<br/><br/>「口」は "mouth"、「酸っぱく」は "sour"、「する」は "to make" を意味するので、「口を酸っぱくする」の文字どおりの意味は "to make one's mouth soar" となります。<br/><br/>この表現の語源は定かではありませんが、以下の二つの説が考えられます。<br/><br/>一つは、話し続けて口の中が乾燥すると、口腔内が酸性に傾き、酸っぱく感じることに由来するという説です。<br/><br/>もう一つは、何度も同じ苦言や警告をするために、表情が酸っぱいものを食べたときのようになることに由来するという説です。
