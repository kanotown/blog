AEDの勘違い<br/><br/>日本にはいたるところにAED（自動体外式除細動器）が設置されており、その普及率は世界一だそうです。<br/><br/>しかし、その稼働率は3.7％と低く、我々はもっとAEDについて知っておく必要があります。<br/><br/>私は、AEDは心停止した患者に電気ショックを与え、再び心臓を動かす装置だと思っていました。<br/><br/>実際、私はそのようなシーンをドラマで見た覚えがあります。<br/><br/>しかし、AEDはあくまで心室細動（心室が痙攣し、血液を循環できない状態）を取り除くための装置であり、止まった心臓を蘇生させるものではないそうです。<br/><br/>心室細動でも心停止でも脈は停止するので、細動か心停止かを確認するには心電図を見る必要があります。<br/><br/>心臓が止まっていたら、心臓マッサージをしましょう。
