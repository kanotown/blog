秘書<br/><br/>社長や大臣など、要職の人物の近くに身を置き、事務仕事や用務の補助をする人や職業のことを「秘書」と言います。<br/><br/>「秘」は "secret," 「書」は "paper" や "book" を意味するので、「秘書」の文字通りの意味は "a secret paper" となります。<br/><br/>この言葉は中国で使われており、平安時代に日本に伝わりましたが、もともとはどちらの国でも文字通り「秘密の書物」を表していました。<br/><br/>欧米から "secretary" という職種が輸入されたことをきっかけに、「秘書」が「人」や「職」を指す言葉として定着したようです。
