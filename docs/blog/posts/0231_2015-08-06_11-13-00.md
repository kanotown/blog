<div class="date" hidden>Aug 6, 2015 11:13</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today, I learned about rules of e-mail addresses.<br/><br/>The form of e-mail addresses is defined by the global common standard called RFC.<br/><br/>If you violated this standard when you created your address, the address would not be used properly.<br/><br/>The basic four rules are the following:<br/><br/>・You have to put an alphabet or a number just prior to '@ (at sign).'<br/><br/>・You have to use an alphabet as the first character of your address.<br/><br/>・You must not use two or more dots(.) or underscores(_) continuously.<br/><br/>・You must not use the signs like / ! “@ # $ % &amp; ‘ ( ) = ~ | \ ^ : ; * + ? &lt; &gt; , ` [ ] { }<br/><br/>However, if you try to create a violated e-mail address, the recent system will alert the violation and you can't create the address.<br/><br/>Therefore, there is no need to worry about these rules.
