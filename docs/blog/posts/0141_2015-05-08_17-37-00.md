<h1 id="subject_show">Counting of Rabbit</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>May 8, 2015 17:37</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
In Japan, there are so many counter words.<br/><br/>Since there are also some strange one, even Japanese sometimes mistake their use.<br/><br/>For example, the counting of rabbit.<br/><br/>According to the general definition, rabbits should be counted as "1匹, 2匹, ...(one animal, two animals, ...)," but we count rabbits as "1羽, 2羽, ...(one bird, two birds, ...)."<br/><br/>The reason why we count rabbits as if they are birds is based on historical and religious backgrounds.<br/><br/>In the former Buddhism in Japan, it was forbidden to eat quadrupedal animals.<br/><br/>However, Japanese wanted to eat rabbits, and the rabbits hippety-hop, so they considered the rabbits as birds.<br/><br/>It is definitely quiddity, haha.<br/><br/>Actually, both "う(cormorant)" and "さぎ(heron)" of "うさぎ(rabbit)" means birds.

日本語には非常に多くの数詞が存在します。<br/><br/>中には少し変わったものや、日本人でも時々間違えるものもあります。<br/><br/>例えば、うさぎの数え方です。<br/><br/>一般的な定義に従えば、うさぎは1匹2匹と数えることになりますが、実際は1羽2羽と数えます。<br/><br/>1羽2羽という数え方は、通常は鳥類に対して使います。<br/><br/>うさぎをまるで鳥のように数えるようになったことには、歴史的・宗教的な背景があります。<br/><br/>かつての仏教では、基本的に4足歩行の動物を食べてはいけませんでした。<br/><br/>しかし日本人は、うさぎを食べたかったため、うさぎはピョンピョン跳ねるから鳥だと屁理屈をこねました。<br/><br/>実は、うさぎの「う」と「さぎ」はどちらも鳥を表しています。

Thank you so much for correcting my post! :)<br/><br/>&gt; Sorry, what do you mean by 'quiddity'?<br/>I wanted to say "屁理屈（へりくつ）," which means something like "quibbling" or "sophism." I think I could use the word "cheat" or "fakery." My dictionary showed various expressions of "屁理屈," but maybe I made a wrong choice. Sorry!
