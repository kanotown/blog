<h1 id="subject_show">Stop Signs in Japan</h1>
<div class="date" hidden>Feb 8, 2016 11:24</div>
<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
According to the international standards, a stop sign has an octagon shape, but it has an inverted triangle shape in Japan.<br/><br/>Originally, Japan had used an octagon shape for the stop sign following the US, but in 1963, we changed it into an inverted triangle that had been used in Germany, because the shape had a high visibility.<br/><br/>However, in 1968, since an octagon shape was decided as the international standards, Germany changed stop signs into octagon shapes.<br/><br/>Finally, only Japan has been left behind.<br/><br/>Also, recently the Japanese government seems to consider changing the stop sign into the octagon shape in concert with the Tokyo Olympic in 2020.<br/><br/>Since the number of stop signs on Japanese roads is about 1.7 billion, it will cost 22.5 billion yen (192 million dollars) to replace all of them.<br/><br/>※Sorry, the number 22.5 billion was wrong, and the correct number is 25.5 billion (217 million dollars).

日本の一時停止の標識<br/><br/>一時停止の道路標識は、国際基準では八角形ですが、日本の場合は逆三角形です。<br/><br/>元々日本はアメリカに合わせて八角形の標識でしたが、1963年にドイツ式の逆三角のほうが視認性が高いということで変更したようです。<br/><br/>しかし1968年、八角形が国際基準になったことからドイツも八角形に変更して、日本だけが取り残されました。<br/><br/>そして現在日本では、2020年の東京オリンピックに合わせて一時停止の標識を八角形にすることを検討しているようです。<br/><br/>日本に一時停止の道路標識は170万ヶ所あり、全て取り替えると約255億円かかります。

 Great job!! :D This was really interesting to read! If they do change the stop signs, it will be very expensive.

<p class="correction_comment">If Germany used it before Japan, but discontinued it's use before Japan adopted it, you would say it like you do.

 Very interesting to hear about! It seems silly to me to do that. I think making it easier to drive in another country is asinine. A person who drives should learn the signals and rules where they choose to travel. I know a lot of people here in the US that need to learn how to drive period. They forget that all state laws for driving are not the same, and they barely follow the law in their own states. There should be a test administered every few years to make sure people still know the rules of the road. There is so much reckless driving here, and to make driving easier for people to understand that typically act like idiots on the road just seems ridiculous to me.

Thank you very much for correcting my post! :)<br/>Yes, there is the proverb "郷に入っては郷に従え('Every country has its fashion' or 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do')," and I also think people should learn the rules when they travel. Furthermore, I think many Japanese will be disturbed if the familiar sign shape is suddenly changed.
