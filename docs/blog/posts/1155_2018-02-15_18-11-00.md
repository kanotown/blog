嗚咽<br/><br/>私は先週新しい仕事の面接を受けましたが、昨日不採用通知がきました。<br/><br/>今にも声を詰まらせて泣き出しそうです。<br/><br/>このような状態のことを、日本語で「嗚咽」ということがあります。<br/><br/>「嗚」は悲しんだり泣いたりする声のことを、「咽」は息が詰まるように（むせるように）泣くことを意味します。<br/><br/>吐き気がするとき「おえ」と言うことから、嗚咽の意味を「吐き気を催すこと」や「吐きそうなほど泣くこと」と考える人がいますが、これは間違っています。

"Sob in a choking voice" is not a phrase I have ever heard or used. I think that "sob" by itself may mean what you are saying 嗚咽 means.
