「近年」と「近日」<br/><br/>今日は、日本語の少しおかしな単語に気が付きました。<br/><br/>「近年」と「近日」です。<br/><br/>「近」は "close" や "near" という意味であり、「年」は "year" を、「日」は "day" を意味します。<br/><br/>そして、「近年」は "recently" や "in recent years" のように、現在を含む過去を表します。<br/><br/>しかし、「近日」は "soon" や "in a few days" のように、近い未来を表します。<br/><br/>似た構造の言葉なのに、示す意味が異なります。<br/><br/>使用する際は注意して下さい。<br/><br/>ちなみに、「近週」や「近月」といった言葉はありません。
