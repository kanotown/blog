クチャラー<br/><br/>昨日は、マヨネーズが大好きな人を指す「マヨラー」、そしてケチャップが大好きな人を指す「ケチャラー」という俗語を紹介しました。<br/><br/>「ケチャラー」と響きがよく似た俗語に、「クチャラー」というものがあります。<br/><br/>食べ物を口に含んだ状態で、唇を閉めずに咀嚼をすると、その咀嚼音は他人に聞こえます。<br/><br/>このときの咀嚼音を、日本では「くちゃくちゃ」という擬音で表現します。<br/><br/>このことから、口を開けて咀嚼音を出しながら食べる人のことを、「クチャラー」と呼ぶようになりました。<br/><br/>多くのクチャラーは自覚症状が無いようですが、他人を不快にさせることが多いので、気を付けて下さい。

<li class="corrected correct">
Because of this, people who eat something while opening the mouth and making the sound have come to be called "kuchaler."
<p class="correction_comment">This is grammatically fine.  As an alternative, though, you could say this:<br/><br/>Because of this, people who make this sound by chewing with their mouths open have come to be called "kuchaler."</p>

Almost all kuchalers <span class="f_red"><span class="sline">don't</span></span> seem <span class="f_blue"><span class="f_bold">not</span></span> to be aware of the chewing sound, but it can make many people <span class="f_red"><span class="sline">unpleasant</span> </span>uneasy, so please be careful not to be a kuchaler.
<p class="correction_comment">You could also say this:<br/><br/>Almost all kuchalers seem to be unaware of the chewing sound.<br/><br/>This is probably a better option, since you don't have to deal with awkward negative words like "don't" and "not."</p>
