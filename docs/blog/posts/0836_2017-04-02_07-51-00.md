<div id="post"><div id="body_show_ori">
Today I will talk about the Japanese word "kakashi."<br/><br/>"Kakashi" is a doll made of bamboo or straw -- it is put in a field to drive destructive animals like birds off. <br/><br/>It is thought that this word comes from the verbal noun "kagashi," which means to make someone smell at something.<br/><br/>This is because in the past, we drove animals off with a bad smell generated by burning meat or hair.<br/><br/>Nowadays, balloons that mimic huge eyes are used as kakashi, taking advantage of an animal instinct that they fear big eyes.<br/><br/>Incidentally, "kakasi" by Masashi Sada is a nice song that remind us of our parents' loves, so please listen it if you have time.

かかし<br/><br/>今日は「かかし」という単語を紹介します。<br/><br/>「かかし」は鳥などの害獣を追い払うために田畑の中に設置する、竹や藁で作った人形やそれに類するもののことです。<br/><br/>この言葉は、「嗅がし」から来ていると考えられています。<br/><br/>かつて、獣肉や髪の毛を焼き焦がし、悪臭を「嗅がす」ことで害獣を追い払っていたためです。<br/><br/>現代では、大きな目を恐れるという動物の本能に注目し、巨大な目玉を模した風船などもかかしとして利用されています。<br/><br/>ちなみに、日本の歌手さだまさしによる「案山子」は親の愛を思い出す良い曲なので、よかったら聴いてみて下さい。
